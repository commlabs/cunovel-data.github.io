Jedrik and McKie found themselves in the hallway leading to her quarters.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie, aware of the effort she was expending to conceal a deep weariness, watched her carefully.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She concentrated on presenting a show of vitality, her attention glued on the prospect ahead.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;There was no way of telling what went on in her mind.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie did not attempt to break the silence.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He had his own worries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was the real Jedrik?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;How was she going to employ Pcharky?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Could he resist her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew he was close to a solution of the Dosadi mystery, but the prospect of the twin gambles he was about to take filled him with doubts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn coming from the projection room, they\u0027d found themselves in a strange delaying situation, as though it were something planned for their frustration.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Everything had been prepared for their movement - guards warned, elevator waiting, doors opened.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But every time they thought the way clear, they met interference.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Except for the obvious importance of the matters which delayed them, it was easy to imagine a conspiracy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA party of Gowachin at Gate Seventy wanted to surrender, but they demanded a parley first.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;One of Jedrik\u0027s aides didn\u0027t like the situation.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Something about the assessment of the offer bothered her, and she wanted to discuss it with Jedrik.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She stopped them halfway down the first hall outside the projection room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aide was an older woman who reminded McKie vaguely of a Wreave lab worker at BuSab, one who\u0027d always been suspicious of computers, even antagonistic toward them.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;This Wreave had read every bit of history he could find about the evolution of such instruments and liked to remind his listeners of the misuses of the DemoPol.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Human history had provided him with abundant ammunition, what with its periodic revolts against \"enslavement by machines.\"\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Once, he\u0027d cornered McKie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look here!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;See this sign:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0027Gigo.\u0027\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;That\u0027s a very old sign that was hung above one of your ancient computers.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It\u0027s an acronym:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0027Garbage In, Garbage Out.\u0027\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;You see!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They knew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Jedrik\u0027s female aide reminded him of that Wreave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie listened to her worries.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She roamed all around a central disquiet, never settling on a particular thing.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Aware of Aritch\u0027s deadline and Jedrik\u0027s fatigue, McKie felt the pressures bearing down upon him.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The aide\u0027s data was accurate.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Others had checked it.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Finally, he could hold his impatience no longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who fed this data into your computer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aide was startled at the interruption, but Jedrik turned to him, waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it was Holjance,\" the aide said. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get him in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her, then!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Make sure she\u0027s actually the one who fed in that data.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoljance was a pinch-faced woman with deep wrinkles around very bright eyes.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Her hair was dark and wiry, skin almost the color of McKie\u0027s.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Yes, she was the one who\u0027d fed the data into the computer because it had arrived on her shift, and she\u0027d thought it too important to delegate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it you want?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw no rudeness in this.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was Dosadi directness.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Important things were happening all around.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Don\u0027t waste time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You saw this assessment of the surrender offer?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you satisfied with it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The data went in correctly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not my question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I\u0027m satisfied!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood ready to defend herself against any charge that she\u0027d slighted her job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me, Holjance,\" he said, \"if you wanted the Gowachin computers to produce inaccurate assessments, what would you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about this a moment, blinked, glanced almost furtively at Jedrik who appeared lost in thought. \"Well, sir, we have a regular filtering procedure for preventing . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it,\" Jedrik said.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"If I were a Gowachin, I would not be doing that right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJedrik turned, barked orders to the guards behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s another trap!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Take care of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they emerged from the elevator on Jedrik\u0027s floor, there was another delay, one of the escort who\u0027d been with McKie at Gate Eighteen.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;His name was Todu Pellas and McKie addressed him by name, noting the faint betrayal of pleasure this elicited.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Pellas, too, had doubts about carrying out a particular order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re supposed to back up Tria\u0027s move by attacking across the upper parkway, but there are some trees and other growth knocked down up there that haven\u0027t been moved for two days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who knocked down those trees?\" McKie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie understood.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;You feinted.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The Gowachin were supposed to believe this would provide cover for an attack, but there\u0027d been no attack for two days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They must be under pretty heavy strain,\" Jedrik said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie nodded.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;That, too, made sense.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The alternative Gowachin assumption was that the Humans were trying to fake them into an attack at that point.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But the cover had not been removed by either side for two days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJedrik took a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have superior firepower and when Tria . . . well.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;You should be able to cut right through there to . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call off that attack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But. . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call it off!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw the direction of his reasoning. Broey had learned much from the force which Gar and Tria had trained. And Jedrik herself had provided the final emphasis in the lesson. She saw there was no need to change her orders to Pellas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePellas had taken it upon himself to obey McKie, not waiting for Jedrik\u0027s response, although she was his commander.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He already had a communicator off his belt and was speaking rapidly into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Dig in for a holding action.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spoke in an aside to Jedrik.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can handle it from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a few steps, Jedrik and McKie found themselves in her room.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Jedrik leaned with her back against the door, no longer trying to conceal her fatigue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"McKie, you\u0027re becoming very Dosadi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crossed to the concealing panels, pulled out the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, she knew all about the sixty-hour deadline - less than fifty-five hours now.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Dosadi\u0027s destruction was a reaction she hadn\u0027t expected from \"X,\" and she blamed herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned, studied her, saw that she\u0027d passed some previously defined limit of personal endurance.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She possessed no amplifiers of muscles or senses, none of the sophisticated aids McKie could call upon in emergencies.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She had nothing but her own magnificent mind and body.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And she\u0027d almost run them out.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Still, she pressed on.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;This told him a great deal about her motivation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie found himself deeply touched by the fact that she\u0027d not once berated him for hiding that ultimate threat which Aritch held over Dosadi.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She\u0027d accepted it that someone in Aritch\u0027s position could erase an entire planet, that McKie had been properly maneuvered into concealing this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe alternative she offered filled McKie with misgivings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExchange bodies?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe understood now that this was Pcharky\u0027s function, the price the old Gowachin paid for survival.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Jedrik had explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He will perform this service one more time.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;In exchange, we release him from Dosadi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he\u0027s one of the original . . . I mean, why doesn\u0027t he just leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We haven\u0027t provided him with a body he can use.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie had suppressed a feeling of horror.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But the history of Dosadi which Jedrik unfolded made it clear that a deliberate loophole had been left in the Caleban contract which imprisoned this planet.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Fannie Mae had even said it.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He could leave in another body.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;That was the basic purpose behind this experiment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew bodies for old!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAritch had expected this to be the ultimate enticement, luring McKie into the Gowachin plot, enlisting McKie\u0027s supreme abilities and his powerful position in BuSab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new body for his old one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll he\u0027d have to do would be to cooperate in the destruction of a planet, conceal the real purpose of this project, and help set up another body-trade planet better concealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Aritch had not anticipated what might be created by Jedrik plus McKie. They now shared a particular hate and motivation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJedrik still stood at the door waiting for him to decide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me what to do,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure that you\u0027re willing to . . \".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jedrik!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought he saw the beginning of tears.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It wasn\u0027t that she hid them, but that they reached a suppression level barely visible and she defied them.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She found her voice, pointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That panel beside the bed.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Pressure latch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe panel swung wide to reveal two shimmering rods about two centimeters in diameter.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The rods danced with the energies of Pcharky\u0027s cage.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They emerged from the floor, bent at right angles about waist height and, as the panel opened, they rotated to extend into the room - two glowing handles about a meter apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie stared at them.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He felt a tightness in his breast.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;What if he\u0027d misread Jedrik?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Could he be sure of any Dosadi?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;This room felt as familiar to him now as his quarters on CC.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was here that Jedrik had taught him some of the most essential Dosadi lessons.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Yet . . . he knew the old pattern of what she proposed.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The discarded body with its donor ego had always been killed immediately.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll have your answer to that question when we\u0027ve done this thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Dosadi response, ambiguous, heavy with alternatives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced around the room, found it hard to believe that he\u0027d known this place only these few days.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;His attention returned to the shimmering rods.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Another trap?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew he was wasting precious time, that he\u0027d have to go through with this.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But what would it be like to find himself in Jedrik\u0027s flesh, wearing her body as he now wore his own?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;PanSpechi transferred an ego from body to body.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;But something unspeakable which they would not reveal happened to the donor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie took a trembling breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had to be done.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He and Jedrik shared a common purpose.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;She\u0027d had many opportunities to use Pcharky simply to escape or to extend her life . . . the way, he realized now, that Broey had used the Dosadi secret.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The fact that she\u0027d waited for a McKie forced him to believe her.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Jedrik\u0027s followers trusted her - and they were Dosadi.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And if he and Jedrik escaped, Aritch would find himself facing a far different McKie from the one who\u0027d come so innocently across the Rim.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;They might yet stay Aritch\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe enticement had been real, though.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;No doubting that.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Shed an old body, get a new one.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;And the Rim had been the major source of raw material:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;strong, resilient bodies.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Survivors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do I do?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt a hand on his shoulder, and she spoke from beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are very Dosadi, McKie.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Astonishing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at her, saw what it had cost her to move here from the door.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He slipped a hand around her waist,

was rage driving her, rage against Aritch, the embodiment of \"X,\" the embodiment of a contrived fate.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He understood this.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The solution of the Dosadi mystery had left him feeling empty, but on the edges there was such a rage as he\u0027d never before experienced.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He was still BuSab, though.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He wanted no more bloodshed because of Dosadi, no more Gowachin justifications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJedrik\u0027s voice interrupted his thoughts and he saw that she also shared some of his misgivings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I come from a long line of heretics.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;None of us doubted that Dosadi was a crime, that somewhere there was a justice to punish the criminals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKie almost sighed.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Not the old Messiah dream!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Not that!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He would not fill that role, even for Dosadi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as though Jedrik read his mind.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Perhaps, with that simulation model of him she carried in her head, this was exactly what she did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We didn\u0027t expect a hero to come and save us.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;We knew that whoever came would suffer from the same deficiencies as the other non-Dosadi we
