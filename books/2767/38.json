Why do you have to do something that might end up with you in jail?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put her soft, pale cheek in my palm and give her a wistful smile. \"Didn\u0027t you know gang members deal drugs? It\u0027s part of the job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So quit. Surely there\u0027s some way. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to quit, they give you a challenge. Sometimes it\u0027s torture, sometimes a beating. If you live, you get out. Let me tell you, preciosa, only once have I seen anyone come out of a challenge alive. The guy still wishes he was dead, he got beat up so bad. God, you\u0027ll never understand, my family needs this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand leaves her. \"No, not for the money.\" I throw my head back and wince in frustration. \"Can we please change the subject?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m against you doing anything illegal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Querida, you need a saint. Or at least a minister. And I\u0027m neither of those.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t I important to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then prove it to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull my bandanna off my head, then rake my fingers through my hair. \"Do you know how hard it\u0027s been for me? Mi madre expects me to protect the family by being in the Blood but is in total denial, Hector wants me to prove I\u0027m dedicated to the Blood, and you ... the one person who I feel like I can start a life with someday, you want me to prove I love you by doin\u0027 somethin\u0027 that could put my family in danger. I have to do this, you know. And nobody, not even you, is gonna change my mind. Oluidalo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll risk what we have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dammit, don\u0027t do this. We don\u0027t have to risk anythin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you start dealing drugs, it\u0027s over. I\u0027ve jeopardized everything for you ... for us. My friends. My parents. Everything. Can\u0027t you do the same?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI toss my jacket to her when her teeth start chattering. \"Here. Put this on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0027s it. This is my life. If she can\u0027t handle it, she can go back to Colin Adams. Or whoever she can mold into her own Ken doll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tells me to take her to her friend Sierra\u0027s house. \"I think we should work separately on the chemistry project,\" Brittany says. She hands me back my jacket when we reach the big house on the beach. \"Do you want to put the hand warmers together or would you rather write the paper?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m a pretty good writer. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. I\u0027ll do the rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex, it doesn\u0027t have to end like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch as tears well in her eyes. I\u0027ve got to get out of here before they start falling down her face. That will definitely be my undoing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, it does,\" I say, then drive off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 49 Brittany\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I used two boxes of tissues, Sierra gave up on trying to cheer me up and let me cry myself to sleep. In the morning, I beg her to keep her curtains closed and shades down. There\u0027s nothing wrong with staying in bed all day, is there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for not saying I told you so,\" I say as I scan her closet for something to wear after she forces me to get up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s standing by her dresser, putting on makeup. \"I\u0027m not saying it, but I sure am thinking it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I say dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSierra pulls a pair of jeans and a long-sleeve shirt out of her closet. \"Here, wear these. You won\u0027t look half as good in my clothes as you do in yours, but you\u0027ll still look better than any girl at Fairfield.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t say that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? It\u0027s true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s not. My top lip is too fat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guys think it\u0027s sexy. Movie stars pay big bucks for big lips.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My nose is crooked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only from a certain angle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My boobs are lopsided.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re big, Brit. Guys are obsessed with big boobs. They could care less if they\u0027re lopsided.\" She pulls me in front of the mirror. \"Face it, you\u0027re model-gorgeous. Okay, so your eyes are bloodshot and you\u0027ve got bags from crying all night. But all in all, you\u0027ve got it goin\u0027 on. Look in the mirror, Brit, and say out loud I\u0027m the bomb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on. It\u0027ll make you feel better. Look right in the mirror and yell my boobs rock!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nuh-uh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you at least admit you\u0027ve got good hair?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at Sierra. \" You talk to yourself in front of a mirror?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do. Wanna see?\" She pushes me aside and moves up close to the mirror. \"Not half-bad, Sierra,\" she tells herself. \"Doug is one lucky guy.\" She turns to me. \"See, it\u0027s easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of laughing, I start to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ami that ugly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it because I don\u0027t have clothes with bling? I know your mom kicked you out, but do you think she\u0027ll let us go over and raid your closet? I don\u0027t know how long you\u0027ll be able to stand wearing my size-eight clothes on your size-four body.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom didn\u0027t call here last night looking for me. I kind of expected her to, but then again she rarely meets my expectations. And my dad . . . well, he probably doesn\u0027t know I didn\u0027t sleep at home. They can keep my clothes. I\u0027ll probably sneak in during the day to check up on Shelley, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want my advice?\" Sierra asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at her warily. \"I don\u0027t know. You hated the idea of Alex and me together from the beginning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not true, Brit. I didn\u0027t tell you this, but he\u0027s actually a nice guy when he loosens up. I had fun the day we all went to Lake Geneva. Doug did, too, and even said Alex was cool to hang with. I don\u0027t know what happened between the two of you, but either forget about him, or give him everything you\u0027ve got in your arsenal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that what you do with Doug?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles. \"Sometimes Doug needs a wake-up call. When our relationship starts getting comfortable, I do something to switch it up. Don\u0027t interpret my advice as an excuse to go after Alex. But if he\u0027s what you really want, well, then, who am I to tell you not to go for it? I hate seeing you sad, Brit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was I happy with Alex?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obsessed is more like it. But yeah, I saw you happy. Happier than you\u0027ve been in a really, really long time. With someone you like that much, the lows are as low as the highs are high. Does that make sense?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It does. It also makes me sound bipolar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Love will do that to a person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 50 Alex\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m eating breakfast the morning after Brittany\u0027s warehouse visit when I glimpse a shaved head peeking through my front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paco, if that\u0027s you I\u0027d stay the hell away from me,\" I call out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMi\u0027ama slaps me on the back of my head. \"That\u0027s no way to treat your friends, Alejandro.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI go back to eating while she opens the door for that. . . traitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not still mad at me, Alex,\" Paco says, \"are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course he\u0027s not mad at you, Paco. Now sit down and eat. I\u0027ve made some chorizo con huevos.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaco has the gall to pat me on the shoulder. \"I forgive you, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up then, first at mi\u0027ama to make sure she isn\u0027t paying attention, then at Paco. \"You forgive me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got yourself a real fat lip, Paco,\" she says, examining the damage I\u0027d done to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaco touches his lip lightly. \"Yeah, I fell onto a fist. You know how it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t. You fall onto too many fists you\u0027re going to end up in the hospital one day,\" she warns, shaking her finger at him. \"Well, I\u0027m going to work. And Paco, keep away from fists today, si? Lock up before you go out, Alejandro, porfis. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glare at Paco.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what. How could you have brought Brittany to the warehouse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Paco says as he chows down on our food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you\u0027re not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, you\u0027re right. I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch in disgust as he uses his fingers to scoop food up and shove it into his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know why I put up with you,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what happened with you and Brittany last night?\" Paco asks while following me outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy breakfast is threatening to come up, and it\u0027s not due to Paco\u0027s eating habits. I grab his collar. \"It\u0027s over between Brittany and me. I don\u0027t even want to hear her name again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speak of the devil,\" he says, craning his neck. I release Paco and turn around, expecting to see Brittany. But she isn\u0027t there and the next thing I know Paco\u0027s fist is in my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now we\u0027re even. And boy, have you got it bad for Miss Ellis if you\u0027re threatenin\u0027 me if I use her name. I know you could kill me with your two hands,\" Paco says, \"but I got to admit... I don\u0027t think you\u0027d do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I test my jaw, I taste blood. \"I wouldn\u0027t be too sure of that. Tell you what. I won\u0027t kick your ass if you stop interferin\u0027 in my life. That means with Hector and Miss Ellis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got to tell ya, interferin\u0027 in your life is what keeps me goin\u0027. Hell, even the beatin\u0027 my old man gave me last night when he was shit-faced drunk doesn\u0027t give me as much entertainment as your life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lower my head. \"I\u0027m sorry, Paco. I shouldn\u0027t have hit you. You get it enough from your old man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaco murmurs a \"don\u0027t sweat it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast night was the first time I\u0027ve regretted using my fists on anyone. Paco has gotten beat up so many times by his old man, he probably has permanent scars on his body. I\u0027m a complete asshole for hitting him. In a way I\u0027m glad it\u0027s over between me and Brittany. I\u0027m unable to control my feelings or emotions when she\u0027s near.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy only hope is that outside of chemistry I can avoid her. Yeah, right. Even if she\u0027s not with me, thoughts of her are always in my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne good thing about my breakup with Brittany--it\u0027s given me time these last two weeks to think about my father\u0027s murder. The night is starting to come back to me in flashes. Something doesn\u0027t fit, but I can\u0027t figure it out. My dad smiled, talked, and was shocked and nervous when the gun was pulled on him. Shouldn\u0027t he have been wary all along?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight is Halloween, the night Hector chose for the drug deal to go down. All day I\u0027ve been restless. I\u0027ve worked on seven cars today, from giving an oil change to replacing worn-out, leaky gaskets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left Hector\u0027s gun in my bedroom drawer, not wanting to pack heat until I absolutely have to. Which is actually stupid because this will be the first of many drug deals I\u0027ll be doing in my lifetime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re like your old man. I shrug off the voice inside my head that\u0027s been plaguing me all day. Como el Viejo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t help it. I remember all the times my papa said Somos cuates, Alejandro. You and me are the closest. He always spoke Spanish, as if he was still in Mexico. Someday you gonna be strong like your padre? he\u0027d ask in Spanish. I always looked up to my father as if he was a deity. Claro, Papa. I want to be like you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father never said to me I could be better or do better than him. But tonight I\u0027ll prove I\u0027m a carbon copy of my old man. I tried to be different by telling Carlos and Luis they can have a different path. I\u0027m an idiot to think I\u0027ve been a role model to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy thoughts drift to Brittany. I\u0027ve tried to forget Brittany will be going with someone else to the Halloween dance. I heard she was going with her old boyfriend. I try to push out of my mind the fact that another guy will have his hands on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer date will kiss her tonight, I\u0027m sure of it. Who wouldn\u0027t want to kiss those sweet, soft, frosted lips? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-38.html","bookId":2767,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM"}
