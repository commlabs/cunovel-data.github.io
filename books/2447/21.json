He cocked his head sideways, raising one of the ears stitched beneath his grey skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Footsteps? behind us. Can\u0027t you hear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My ears are plugged up,\" I reminded him. \"Are you certain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I think it\u0027s just one person, but I? could be wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t fight and hold on to Darius at the same time,\" Debbie said. \"If we\u0027re to make a stand, we should either tie him up or let him go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not letting him go anywhere,\" I muttered. \"You two proceed. If R.V. leads the others to Steve, you need to be there with Darius, to trade for Shancus. I\u0027ll stay and deal with this. If I can, I\u0027ll catch you up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be stupid,\" Debbie hissed. \"We\u0027ve got to stick together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do what I say!\" I snapped, harsher than necessary. I was very confused - hatred for Steve, fear that I might become the monstrous Lord of the Shadows, the pain of the purge - and in no mood to argue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" Harkat said to Debbie. \"We can\u0027t talk to him when he\u0027s? like this. Besides, he\u0027s right. It makes more sense this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the danger?\" Debbie began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a Vampire Prince,\" Harkat said. \"He knows all about danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarkat jerked Darius ahead, limping forward as quickly as he could. Debbie had no choice but to follow, though she looked back imploringly at me before turning a corner out of sight. I felt sorry for the way I\u0027d snapped at her, and hoped I\u0027d have a chance to apologize later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI removed the cotton buds from my ears and nose and took a firm grip on my knife. By concentrating hard, I could dim the noise within my head and focus on the street sounds and scents. I heard footsteps approaching, soft, steady, coming straight towards me. I crouched low and readied myself for battle. Then a figure came into sight and I relaxed, stood and lowered my knife arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evanna,\" I greeted the witch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darren,\" she replied calmly, stopping close by, studying me with an unreadable expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why aren\u0027t you with your father?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will join him again presently,\" she said. \"My place is here now, with you and your allies. Let us hurry after them, for fear we miss the confrontation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going nowhere,\" I said, standing my ground. \"Not until you give with some answers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed?\" Evanna purred archly. \"I will need to hear some questions first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s about the Lord of the Shadows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think this is the time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care what you think!\" I interrupted. \"You told me years ago that would be either the Vampaneze Lord - Steve - orme . Mr Tall, before he died, said that would rise no matter who won the War of the Scars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he?\" Evanna sounded surprised. \"It was not like Hibernius to be so revealing. He was always the more secretive one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to know what it means,\" I pressed on, before she got sidetracked talking about her dead brother. \"According to Mr Tall, will be a monster, and he\u0027ll kill Vancha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He told you that too?\" Evanna was angry now. \"He went too far. He should not have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he did,\" I stopped her, then took a step nearer. \"He was wrong. He must have been. You too. I\u0027m no monster. I would never harm Vancha, or any vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be too sure of that,\" she said softly, then hesitated, choosing her next words carefully. \"Usually, there are many paths between the present and future, dozens of options and outcomes. But sometimes there are only afew , or even just two. That is the case here, A Lord of the Shadows will come - this is definite. But he can be one of two people, you or Steve Leonard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But?\" I began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Silence,\" she said commandingly. \"Since we are so close to the time of choosing, I can reveal certain facts which before I could not. I wouldn\u0027t have spoken of this, but it seems my brother wished to inform you of your fate, perhaps to give you time to prepare for it. It is only right that I honour his final wishes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you kill Steve Leonard, youwill become a monster, the most despised and twisted the world has ever seen.\" My eyes bulged and I opened my mouth to protest, but she continued before I uttered a syllable. \"Monsters are not born fully developed. They grow, they mature, theybecome .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are filling with hatred, Darren, hatred which will consume you. If you kill Steve, it will not be enough. You\u0027ll push on, driven by rages you cannot control. Because destiny has marked you out as a bearer of great power, you will create great havoc. You will destroy the vampaneze but that won\u0027t be enough. There will always be a new enemy to fight. During your quest, certain vampires will try to stop you. They too will die at your hands. Vancha will be one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I moaned. \"I would never?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not only vampires will obstruct you,\" Evanna went on, ignoring my protests. \"Humans will interfere, leading you to turn against them. And, as the vampaneze and vampires fall at your hands, so will humanity. You will reduce this world to rubble and ash. And over the remains you will rule, all-powerful, all-controlling, all-hating, for the rest of your unnaturally long and evil life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped and smiled at me witheringly. \"That is your future, where you taste success. In the other, you die at the hands of the alternate Lord of the Shadows, if not during the hunt for him, then later, when the rest of the clan has fallen. In many ways, that might be for the best. Now, have you any more questions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t,\" I said numbly. \"I wouldn\u0027t. There must be some way to avoid it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is,\" Evanna said. She turned and pointed back the way she\u0027d come. \"Go. Walk away. Leave your friends. Hide. If you go now, you\u0027ll break the terms of your destiny. Steve will lead the vampaneze to victory over the vampires and become the Lord of the Shadows. You can lead a normal, peaceful life - until he brings the world crashing down around you, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But? I can\u0027t do that,\" I said. \"I can\u0027t turn my back on those who\u0027ve put their trust in me. What about Vancha, Debbie, Shancus? I have to help them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Evanna said sadly. \"I know. That is why you cannot escape. You have the power to run from your destiny, but your feelings for your friends won\u0027t allow you. You\u0027ll never retreat from a challenge. You can\u0027t. And so, even though you have the best will in the world, you\u0027ll see your destiny through to its bitter end - either death by Steve\u0027s hand, or a rise to infamy as the Lord of the Shadows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wrong,\" I said shakily. \"I won\u0027t do that. I\u0027m not evil. Now that I know, I won\u0027t let myself go down that road. If I kill Steve? if we win? I\u0027ll turn my back on my destiny then. I\u0027ll save the clan if I can, then slip away. I\u0027ll go where I can\u0027t do any harm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Evanna said simply. \"You won\u0027t. Now,\" shewent on before I could argue my case again, \"let us hurry after your friends - this night is central to the future, and it would not do to miss a moment more of it.\" With that, she slid ahead of me and followed after the others, tracking them by means of her own, leaving me to trail behind, silent, dejected, bewildered - and terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe caught up with Debbie, Harkat and Darius after several minutes. They were surprised to see Evanna, but she said nothing to them, just hung back and observed us silently. As we progressed, Debbie asked me if I\u0027d been talking with Evanna. I shook my head, unwilling to repeat what I\u0027d been told, still trying to make sense of it and convince myself that Evanna was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe regrouped with Vancha and Evra a quarter of an hour later. They\u0027d tracked R.V. to a building and were waiting outside for us. \"He went in a few minutes ago,\" Vancha said. \"Alice has gone around the back, in case he tries to escape that way.\" He glanced at Evanna suspiciously. \"Are you here to help or hinder, my Lady?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither, my Prince,\" she smiled. \"I serve merely as a witness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurm!\" he grunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared up at the building. It was tall and dark, with jagged grey stones and broken windows. There were nine steps leading up to the oversized front door. The steps were cracked and covered with moss. Apart from some more moss and broken windows, it hadn\u0027t changed much since my last visit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know this place,\" I told Vancha, trying to forget about my conversation with Evanna and focus on the business at hand. \"It\u0027s an old cinema theatre. This is where the Cirque Du Freak performed when Steve and I were kids. I should have guessed this was where he\u0027d come. It brings everything full circle. Stuff like that is important to a maniac like Steve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shut up about my dad!\" Darius growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think Leonard\u0027s inside?\" Vancha asked, cuffing Darius around the ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure of it,\" I said, wiping streaks of Morgan James\u0027s blood from my forehead - there\u0027d been no time to mop myself clean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Shancus?\" Evra hissed. He was trembling with anxiety. \"Will he harm my son?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not as long as we holdhis son captive,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvra stared at Darius, confused - he knew nothing about the boy - but my old friend trusted me, so he accepted my guarantee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How should we play this?\" Debbie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just march straight in,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that wise?\" Vancha asked. \"Perhaps we should try to sneak up on them from the back, or via the roof.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Steve\u0027s prepared this for us,\" I said. \"Anything we can think of, you can bet he\u0027s already considered. We can\u0027t outguess him. We\u0027d be fools to try. I say we go in, face him directly, and pray that the luck of the vampires is with us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The luck of the damned,\" Darius sneered. \"You won\u0027t beat my father or any vampaneze. We\u0027re more than a match for the likes of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha studied Darius curiously. He leant up close, sniffing like a dog. Then he made a small cut on the boy\u0027s right arm - Darius didn\u0027t even wince - dabbed a finger in the blood that oozed out, and tasted it. He pulled a face. \"He\u0027s been blooded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By my father,\" Darius said proudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a half-vampaneze?\" I frowned, glancing at his fingertips - they were unmarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The blood\u0027s weak within him,\" Vancha said. \"But he\u0027s one of them. There\u0027s just enough blood in his system to ensure he can never regain his humanity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you volunteer for this, or did Steve force you?\" I asked Darius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My father wouldn\u0027t force me to do anything!\" Darius snorted. \"Like every vampaneze, he believes in free choice - not like you lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha looked at me questioningly. \"Steve\u0027s fed him a load of rubbish about us,\" I explained. \"He thinks we\u0027re evil, and his father\u0027s a noble crusader.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is!\" Darius shouted. \"He\u0027ll stop you from taking over the world! He won\u0027t let you kill freely! He\u0027ll keep the night safe from you vampire scum!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha cocked an amused eyebrow at me. \"If we had time, I\u0027d take great delight in setting this boy straight. But we haven\u0027t. Debbie - phone Alice and tell her to come here. We\u0027ll go in together - all for one and all that guff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Debbie was on the phone, Vancha pulled me aside and nodded at Evra, who was standing a few metres ahead of us, gazing at the entrance to the cinema, fingers twisted into desperate fists. \"He\u0027s in a bad way,\" Vancha said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" I muttered. \"How would you expect him to react?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you clear on what we must do?\" Vancha responded. I stared at him coldly. He grabbed my arms and squeezed tight. \"Leonardmust be killed. You and I are expendable. So are Debbie, Alice, Harkat, Evra - and Shancus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to save him,\" I said miserably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do I,\" Vancha sighed. \"And we will, if we can. But the Lord of the Vampaneze comes first. Remember what happens if we fail - the vampires will be destroyed. Would you trade the snake-boy\u0027s life for all those of our clan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not,\" I said, shaking myself free. \"But I won\u0027t abandon him cheaply. If Steve\u0027s prepared to deal, I\u0027ll deal. We can fight him some other night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if he won\u0027t deal?\" Vancha pressed. \"If he forces a showdown?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027ll fight, and we\u0027ll kill or we\u0027ll die - whatever the cost.\" I locked gazes with him so he could see I was telling the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha checked his shurikens and drew a few. Then we turned, gathered our allies around us - Debbie dragged Darius along - and advanced up the steps and into the old abandoned cinema theatre where, for me, all those years ago, the nightmares had begun. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lord-of-the-shadows-the-saga-of-darren-shan-11/page-21.html","bookId":2447,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:20:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:20:12 PM"}
