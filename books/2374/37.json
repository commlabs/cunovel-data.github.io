We\u0027re headed back to Russia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then, the tiny window in the door of the cabin shattered, David jerked and his head slammed hard against the blood-spattered wall behind him. The phone fell from David\u0027s limp fingers and he crumpled to the dusty floorboards with a dull thump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb tried not to jostle the boy as he and Grant hiked back down the road to where they\u0027d left the truck. This was the only road leading to his cabin, and with Grant\u0027s battered old Ford parked across it, no one was getting through this way—at least not without making one hell of a racket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not going to make it long enough to get to the hospital,\" said Grant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb glanced down at the kid. His breathing was shallow and his skin was ashen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe image of Lana lying broken and bleediffg in his arms flashed in his mind, making his chest ache with guilt. It had been almost a year since he\u0027d carried her out of that cave, and there wasn\u0027t a day that went by that he didn\u0027t think about her. There wasn\u0027t a day that went by that he didn\u0027t hate himself for letting those bastards hurt her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d lived. Maybe this kid would, too. \"You\u0027re probably right, but I have to try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. We\u0027re not going to give up on him.\" Grant\u0027s tone was hopeless. Flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to lay him out in the back or keep him in the cab?\u0027 Grant\u0027s rifle was in his skilled hands and his eyes were on the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could hit nearly anything he could see with that rifle, but that did little to ease the tension that had started growing between Caleb\u0027s shoulder blades ever since they\u0027d found the bloody kid. \"I\u0027ll hang on to him. Try to cushion the ride for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they neared the truck, Caleb and Grant both slowed, surveying the area for signs anyone had come this way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks clear,\" said Grant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb saw nothing, but that nagging worry was still grating against him. \"Yeah. Looks clear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant gave him a sideways glance. \"You got a bad feeling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, I hate it when you get those.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too. We\u0027ll drive up to the cabin to check on David and Noelle before we head back down the mountain. Let David know what\u0027s going on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant opened Caleb\u0027s door so he could maneuver the kid inside the passenger\u0027s seat. The truck dipped under his weight, squeaking in protest. Grant hurried around the truck, still keeping his eyes on the trees. He slid in behind the wheel and stowed his rifle in a custom-made slot in the driver\u0027s side door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe inside of the truck was as beat-up as the outside, with a wide crack running along the top of the dashboard, matching those in the aged vinyl seats. The knob on the manual window crank was missing and the lock on the glove compartment was busted so that it had to be held closed with duct tape. The truck smelled of sun-baked plastic, aging foam, half a million french fries and something else that Caleb didn\u0027t recognize—a harsh smell, like week-old sweat and a faint chemical odor that flirted with his memory, something he hadn\u0027t encountered for years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant put the key in the ignition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHomemade explosives. That was the smell. Holy shit!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant\u0027s wrist twitched as he started to turn the key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop!\" shouted Caleb, and ripped Grant\u0027s hand away from the keys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid didn\u0027t make a sound when his leg hit the dash because of Caleb\u0027s jerky movement. Not a good sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell?\" snapped Grant, as he tried to tear his arm away. Caleb didn\u0027t let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get out of the truck. It\u0027s wired to blow.\" Cold sweat. broke out along Caleb\u0027s ribs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant opened the door slowly and eased out of his seat. Caleb leaned down, following his nose to where the smell was the strongest. It was awkward trying to lean over the kid, but he managed to get down far enough to see under the steering column. A bundle of wires led from the ignition to a squat metal can that still had some of the tuna label attached:.Talk about homemade. He could probably disarm it, but it would take time. Time the boy didn\u0027t have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime David and Noelle didn\u0027t have. Someone was out here trying to kill them, and David needed to know it, pronto.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to get back to Noelle,\" said Caleb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant nodded and grabbed his rifle. \"Catch up when you can,\" he said, and took off sprinting up the trail back toward the cabin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb eased out of the truck and laid the boy a safe distance away. There was nothing he could do for him, now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere in the last few moments, the kid\u0027s heart had stopped beating, and without enough blood to keep it pumping, no amount of CPR would help. The boy was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb stood over him for a brief moment, feeling his blood cooling on his hands and clothing. So much fucking blood. So much innocence lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb turned away, unable to stand the sight of yet another life ruined on his watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShame gnawed at him, but he had a job to do, so he shut that part of himself down. If he didn\u0027t hurry, chances were David and Noelle would be added to that list, and he couldn\u0027t let that happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time Caleb was halfway up to the cabin he heard the crack of a rifle and prayed that it was Grant\u0027s rifle that had made the noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle crouched beside David, willing her body not to seize up with fear. Somewhere in the back of her mind, she was still screaming, but the rational part of her brain kicked into gear and assessed the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid\u0027s left arm was bleeding heavily, and Noelle said a quick prayer of thanks that the bullet hadn\u0027t veered more toward the right and everything vital. He was conscious, but groggy, likely from hitting his head on the way down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t dare move him, but she had to do something to stop the bleeding. She ripped off her sweatshirt, heedless of her glasses as they tangled in her hair. She tied the shirt around the wound, pulling it as tight as she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid groaned in pain and his eyes fluttered open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, Noelle could hear the heavy pounding of a helicopter\u0027s blades. The Swarm was coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrenaline surged through her blood, giving her speed and strength. She scrambled to slide the disk she\u0027d burned out of her laptop and tuck it inside David\u0027s shirt. She only had a few seconds before they were here, and she needed to make sure the work she\u0027d done wouldn\u0027t fall into the wrong hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout hesitation, Noelle typed a command into her laptop, executing the clean sweep deletion program that would ensure everything on her hard drive would be scrubbed away without a trace. She didn\u0027t care about all the work she\u0027d done being thrown away. She was only worried about David and making sure he stayed safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook him, wincing when he moaned in pain. Slowly, his eyes opened and she could see confusion clouding his blue eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"David!\" she said, filling her voice with every ounce of terror she was feeling. It got the desired reaction and she could see him forcibly throwing off the effects of his injuries. He looked almost lucid. And mad as hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you remember what I told you the first night we made love?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked and she could see him struggling to focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle leaned down to his face. Fear prowled along her spine with acid claws. She was shaking so hard it was difficult to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed his face in her hands and kissed him. It was a sweet, gentle kiss filled with everything there wasn\u0027t time to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle pulled away and stared directly into his eyes. \"Remember what I told you the first time we made love. It\u0027s important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard footsteps approaching the cabin. They were out of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe threw herself over David\u0027s body and gave in to the torrent of fear and anger and guilt that had begun pounding at her the second she realized David had been shot. Tears streamed down her face in display of grief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pressed her fingers against his neck, blocking off the flow of blood going to David\u0027s brain. In a few seconds he\u0027d pass out. Noelle prayed it would be enough to fool the men coming after her into thinking he was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree armed, masked men burst through the door, sending a spray of wood splinters into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle turned toward them, her face a teary mess. \"You killed him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled the gun from David\u0027s belt, stood and pointed it at the closest man. Before she could pull the trigger, one of the men aimed a pistol and shot her in the leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoelle stumbled and the world became a giant black hole that swallowed her up in one bite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant was too late to stop the man carrying Noelle from getting on the helicopter. He disappeared around the corner of the cabin with her limp body over his shoulder before Grant could take the shot. The two men who were struggling with David\u0027s body were another story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe controlled his breathing as he peered through the scope on his rifle, targeting the head of the man carrying David\u0027s feet. Grant didn\u0027t have time to wait for his heart to stop racing, so he found the rhythm of the beats and made his shot between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePink blood spray bloomed into the air from the man\u0027s head, but Grant was already finding his next target, who hadn\u0027t yet realized why the load he was carrying had suddenly become so heavy. A scant three seconds later, the second man crumpled to the ground in a lifeless heap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe helo pilot must have been given orders to leave without the men, because it was already rising steadily, whipping the limbs of the nearby trees into a frenzy of motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant peered through his scope, targeting the pilot, but then hesitated. Noelle was on that chopper, and if he took it down, it might kill her. If that happened, David would never recover. Assuming he wasn\u0027t dead already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought had Grant\u0027s lungs squeezing hard, blocking off his air. With a vicious curse, Grant ripped the scope from his eye and went to see if David was still alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe throbbing in David\u0027s head woke him. A sense of urgency called him out of the blessed comfort of unconsciousness. Then he remembered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Noelle!\" shouted David, surging to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head spun, and he could barely make out the little cabin among the dozen identical images swimming before his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy,\" said Caleb. \"Just take it easy and sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb\u0027s massive strength forcing David onto a stool left him no choice but to sit or fall down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is Noelle?\" he demanded of all three Calebs who stood in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to find her, David.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFind her? She wasn\u0027t here? Fear and guilt threatened to drive him back into oblivion. Noelle was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid clutched Caleb\u0027s shirt, not caring how desperate he sounded. \"I have to go after her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will,\" assured Caleb in a low, comforting voice. \"But first we have to figure out where to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid\u0027s vision had cleared so that there was only one of everything again. The pain pounding at the back of his skull was still there, as was a deep burning sensation in his left arm. None of that mattered, and he couldn\u0027t let it slow him down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long was I out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb checked his watch. \"Eighteen minutes. Grant stopped two of the men who were trying to pack you up and bring you along. Their helicopter left without them once the shooting started. Noelle was already gone, along with her computer and all her papers,\" continued Caleb in an even voice as if he were talking about the weather rather than the whereabouts of the woman David loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she ...?\" David couldn\u0027teven bring himself to ask. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/no-regrets-delta-force-1/page-37.html","bookId":2374,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:09 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:09 AM"}
