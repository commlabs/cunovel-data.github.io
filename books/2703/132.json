Curled on my side in his bed, I faced his way as he pulled up a pair of pants, and—damn—covered his perfect tush from my view. With a frown, I reached out, stretching since he was standing a good two or three feet away from the mattress, and then I tugged his pants back down until I could see those taut, rounded globes of goodness again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” he yelped and spun around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI giggled sleepily up at him. “Hey, yourself. I was having fun looking at those. Why’d you have to go and cover them up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePleasure spread across his face. “Oh, you want to play, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crawled back onto the bed and pinned me to the mattress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I had him right where I wanted him, I stretched and preened out my pleasure. “I definitely want to play. You have a problem with that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not at all.” He nipped my lips and then angled his head to the side and urged them open with his tongue. The hot, open-mouthed kiss that followed left me weak and breathless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you always make me want you so easily?” I demanded, panting for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jedi mind trick,” he panted back right before his breath fanned my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh...golly. His lips barely pressed against the tender spot right behind my ear and I couldn’t help it, I moaned and arched against him like a cat being scratched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On your belly,” he instructed, rolling me over. “Time for paybacks, so I can enjoy your backside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI immediately rolled over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince I was still naked from our night together, his fingers skimmed around to my front and found their way between my legs as his hips arched against my bottom, letting me feel just how very aroused he was. My breasts began to ache a split second before he cupped one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA finger batted against my nipple while one finger on the other hand pushed inside me. My mouth opened in a silent scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn groaned behind me. “You are so wet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For you, always. Oh...God. Don’t stop,” I commanded as my hips rolled with the thrust of his thick digit. “Don’t stop. Please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn pressed another finger in and pinched my nipple at the same moment. The quick, crisp nip of pain sent my nerve endings haywire until I began to come, hard. The muscles contracting in my abdomen wrenched and twisted savagely enough that I cried out from the pressure. I squirmed against the hand between my legs, wanting to escape and latch on to such sweet torment at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tongue slid up the back of my neck. Our bodies pressed together perfectly as I arched back into him. He was soft and yet hard all at the same time, his flesh all sleepy warm and smooth but the muscle under it hard and supportive. I so loved that about him and couldn’t stop my fingers from reaching back and sinking into his hair. I almost wished I was facing him so my hands could be running up and down his back, marveling at how wonderful he felt. Even the bumps from his scars felt absolutely perfect under my fingers, making little paths of puckered skin to follow in a mazelike pattern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Quinn.” I broke when he bit the back of my shoulder. “I need you inside me. Please. It feels so empty without you there.” My womb had nothing to clench around; it needed something right there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrasping my hips, he remained sitting upright as he drew my bottom back onto his lap and slid me up against his arousal. When the blunt tip of his penis pressed into my opening, I threw my head back and let out a relieved breath. He slid his hand up from between my legs, over my navel and to my breasts. When he cupped one, I choked out a whimper. Then he finally filled me completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached back and grabbed his thighs, my nails digging into his skin. “Harder.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe complied, nearly jarring my teeth as his next powerful thrust reverberated throughout me. I buried my face in my pillow and bit it to keep from screaming too loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn pressed forward, and I moaned from the comfort of his weight against me and the erotic pressure of his cock sliding deeper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was so naughty and wicked, and yet delicious and amazing. I never wanted it to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you turning me into, Quinn Hamilton?” I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe panted behind me and softly slid his hand up my spine and then up into my scalp to grip my hair. “I don’t know. But I love it.” He leaned forward to kiss the side of my jaw. “I am so addicted to you. I could do this forever. I love kissing you, and touching you, entering you. Fucking you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis strokes became longer, slower, excruciatingly frustrating because I just wanted him to slam into me and pound us both into oblivion. This slow death was driving me crazy. I clutched his pillow. “Oh my God. Please.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-132.html","bookId":2703,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM"}
