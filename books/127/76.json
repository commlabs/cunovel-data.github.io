It was\u0026nbsp; empty now and\u0026nbsp; in quite anunnatural state of quiet, as it played unaccustomed host to the Commdor andhis court.\n\u003cbr\u003e Mallow\u0026nbsp; had swung\u0026nbsp; the steel sheet\u0026nbsp; onto the\u0026nbsp; two supports with\u0026nbsp; a carelessheave. He had taken the instrument held out to him by Twer and was grippingthe leather handle inside its leaden sheath.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"The instrument,\"\u0026nbsp; he said, \"is dangerous,\u0026nbsp; but so is a\u0026nbsp; buzz saw. You justhave to keep your fingers away.\"And as\u0026nbsp; he spoke,\u0026nbsp; he drew the\u0026nbsp; muzzle-slit swiftly down the\u0026nbsp; length of thesteel sheet, which quietly and instantly fell in two.\n\u003cbr\u003e There was\u0026nbsp; a unanimous\u0026nbsp; jump, and Mallow\u0026nbsp; laughed. He picked up\u0026nbsp; one of thehalves and propped it\u0026nbsp; against his knee, \"You can adjust the cutting-lengthaccurately to\u0026nbsp; a hundredth of an inch, and a\u0026nbsp; two-inch sheet will slit downthe middle as easily as this thing did. If you\u0027ve got the thickness exactlyjudged, you can place\u0026nbsp; steel on a wooden table, and split the metal withoutscratching the wood.\"And at\u0026nbsp; each phrase,\u0026nbsp; the nuclear shear\u0026nbsp; moved and a gouged\u0026nbsp; chunk of steelflew across the room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"That,\" he said, \"is whittling ?with steel.\"He\u0026nbsp; passed back\u0026nbsp; the shear.\u0026nbsp; \"Or else you\u0026nbsp; have the\u0026nbsp; plane. Do you\u0026nbsp; want todecrease\u0026nbsp; the thickness\u0026nbsp; of\u0026nbsp; a sheet,\u0026nbsp; smooth out\u0026nbsp; an\u0026nbsp; irregularity, removecorrosion? Watch!\"Thin, transparent\u0026nbsp; foil flew\u0026nbsp; off the other\u0026nbsp; half of the\u0026nbsp; original sheet insix-inch swarths, then eight-inch, then twelve.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Or drills? It\u0027s all the same principle.\"They were crowded around\u0026nbsp; now. It might have been a sleight-of-hand show, acomer\u0026nbsp; magician, a\u0026nbsp; vaudeville\u0026nbsp; act made\u0026nbsp; into high-pressure\u0026nbsp; salesmanship.\n\u003cbr\u003e Commdor Asper\u0026nbsp; fingered scraps\u0026nbsp; of steel. High officials\u0026nbsp; of the governmenttiptoed over\u0026nbsp; each other\u0027s\u0026nbsp; shoulders, and whispered,\u0026nbsp; while Mallow punchedclean, beautiful\u0026nbsp; round holes through an inch of\u0026nbsp; hard steel at every touchof his nuclear drill.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Just one\u0026nbsp; more demonstration. Bring two\u0026nbsp; short lengths of pipe, somebody.\"An Honorable\u0026nbsp; Chamberlain of something-or-other sprang\u0026nbsp; to obedience in thegeneral excitement\u0026nbsp; and thought-absorption, and stained\u0026nbsp; his hands like anylaborer.\n\u003cbr\u003e Mallow stood\u0026nbsp; them upright and shaved the ends off\u0026nbsp; with a single stroke ofthe\u0026nbsp; shear,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; and\u0026nbsp; then\u0026nbsp; joined\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; pipes,\u0026nbsp; fresh\u0026nbsp; cut\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; to\u0026nbsp; fresh\u0026nbsp; cut.\n\u003cbr\u003e And there was a\u0026nbsp; single pipe! The new ends, with even atomic irregularitiesmissing, formed one piece upon joining.\n\u003cbr\u003e Then\u0026nbsp; Mallow looked\u0026nbsp; up at\u0026nbsp; his audience,\u0026nbsp; stumbled at\u0026nbsp; his first\u0026nbsp; word andstopped. There\u0026nbsp; was the keen stirring\u0026nbsp; of excitement in his\u0026nbsp; chest, and thebase of his stomach went tingly and cold.\n\u003cbr\u003e The Commdor\u0027s\u0026nbsp; own bodyguard, in the confusion,\u0026nbsp; had struggled to the frontline,\u0026nbsp; and\u0026nbsp; Mallow, for\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; first\u0026nbsp; time, was\u0026nbsp; near\u0026nbsp; enough\u0026nbsp; to see\u0026nbsp; theirunfamiliar hand-weapons in detail.\n\u003cbr\u003e They\u0026nbsp; were nuclear!\u0026nbsp; There\u0026nbsp; was no\u0026nbsp; mistaking it;\u0026nbsp; an\u0026nbsp; explosive projectileweapon\u0026nbsp; with a\u0026nbsp; barrel like that\u0026nbsp; was impossible.\u0026nbsp; But that wasn\u0027t\u0026nbsp; the bigpoint.
