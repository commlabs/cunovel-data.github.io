It was a smallish establishment, quartering perhaps two dozen horses in three wooden barns, with hay, saddles, bridles, and other apparatus hanging from rafters. A casual visitor to this stable might be surprised to hear, instead of the whinny of horses, the predominant sound of barking, growling, snarling dogs. But the meaning of those sounds was clear enough to frequenters of the place, and no cause for particular comment. Throughout London, there were many reputable establishments that operated a side business of training fighting dogs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Jeremy Johnson, Sr., led his red-bearded customer back through the stables. He was a jovial old man with most of his teeth missing. \"Bit of an old gummer myself,\" he said, chuckling. \"Doesn\u0027t hurt the drinking, though, I\u0027ll tell you that.\" He slapped the hindquarters of a horse to push it out of the way. \"Move on, move on,\" he said, then looked back at Pierce. \"Now what is it you\u0027ll be wanting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your best,\" Pierce said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what all the gentlemen are wanting,\" Mr. Johnson said, with a sigh. \"None wants else than the best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am very particular.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I can see that,\" Johnson said. \"I can see that, indeed. You\u0027re seeking a learner, so as to polish him yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Pierce said, \"I want a fully made dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s dear, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very dear, very dear,\" Johnson mumbled, moving back through the stable. He pushed open a creaking door, and they came into a small courtyard at the rear. Here were three wood-boarded circular pits, each perhaps six feet in diameter, and caged dogs on all sides. The dogs yelped and barked as they saw the men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very dear, a made dog,\" Johnson said. \"Takes a proper long training to have a good made dog. Here\u0027s how we do. First we gives the dog to a coster, and he jogs the dog day and day again--- to toughen him, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" Pierce said impatiently, \"but I---\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then,\" Johnson continued, \"then we puts the learner in with an old gummer--- or a young gummer, as the case is now. Lost our gummer a fortnight past, so we took this one\"--- he pointed to a caged dog--- \"and yanked all the teeth, so he\u0027s the gummer now. Very good summer he is, too. Knows how to worry a learner--- very agile, this gummer is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce looked at the gummer. It was a young and healthy dog, barking vigorously. All its teeth were gone, yet it continued to snarl and gull back its lips menacingly. The sight made Pierce laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, yes, \u0027tis a bit of a joke,\" Johnson said, moving around the enclosure, \"but not when you get to this one here. Not here, there\u0027s no joking. Here\u0027s the finest taste dog in all London, I warrant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a mongrel, larger than a bulldog, and parts of its body had been shaved. Pierce knew the routine: a young dog was first trained in sparring bouts with as old and toothless-veteran; then it was put into the pit with a \"taste dog,\" which was expendable but had good spirit. It was in the course of sparring with the taste dog that the learner acquired the final skills to go for the kill. The usual practice was to shave the vulnerable parts of the taste dog, encouraging the learner to attack those areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This taster,\" Johnson said, \"this taster has put the touches on more champions than you can name. You know Mr. Benderby\u0027s dog, the one that bested the Manchester killer last month? Well, this taster here trained Mr. Benderby\u0027s dog. And also Mr. Starrett\u0027s dog, and--- oh, a dozen others, all top fighting dogs. Now Mr. Starrett himself, he comes back to me and wants to buy this very taster. Says he wants to have him to worry a badger or two. You know what he offers me? Fifty quid, he offers me. And you know what I say? Not on your life, I say, not fifty quid for this taster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohnson shook his head a little sadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not for badgers, anyhow,\" he said. \"Badgers are no proper worry for any fighting dog. No, no. A proper fighting dog is for your dogs, or, if need be, for your rats.\" He squinted at Pierce. \"You want your dog for ratting? We have special trained ratters,\" Mr. Johnson said. \"A touch less dear, is why I mention it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want your very best made dog.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you shall have it, I warrant. Here is the devil\u0027s own, right here.\" Johnson paused before a cage. Inside, Pierce saw a bulldog that weighed about forty pounds. The dog growled but did not move. \"See that? He\u0027s a confident one. He\u0027s had a good mouthful or two, and he\u0027s well made. Vicious as ever I saw. Some dogs have the instinct, you know--- can\u0027t be taught \u0027em, they just have the instinct to get a good mouthful straightaway. This here one, he\u0027s got the instinct\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much?\" Pierce said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty quid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With the studded leash, and the collar and muzzle, all in,\" Johnson added\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce still waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll do you proud, I warrant, very proud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a lengthy silence, Pierce said, \"I want your best dog.\" He pointed to the cage. \"This dog has never fought. He has no scars. I want a trained veteran.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you shall have him,\" Johnson said, not blinking. He moved two cages down. \"This one here has the killer instinct, the taste of blood, and quick? Why, quicker than your eye, he is, this one. Took the neck off old Whitington\u0027s charger a week past, at the pub tourney--- perhaps you was there and saw him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce said, \"How much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-five quid, all in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce stared at the animal for a moment, then said, \"I want the best dog you have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the very same, I swear it--- the very dog that\u0027s best of the lot\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce crossed his arms over his chest and tapped his foot on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I swear it, sir, twenty-five quid, a gentleman\u0027s fancy and most excellent in all respects.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce just stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then,\" Johnson said, looking away as if embarrassed, \"there is one more animal, but he\u0027s very special. He has the killer instinct, the taste of blood, the quick move, and a tough hide. This way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe led Pierce out of the enclosed courtyard to another area, where there were three dogs in somewhat larger pens. They were all heavier than the others; Pierce guessed they must weigh fifty pounds, perhaps more. Johnson tapped the middle cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This\u0027un,\" he said. \"This\u0027un turned felon on me,\" he said. \"Thought I\u0027d have to top him off--- he was a felon, pure and simple.\" Johnson rolled up his sleeve to reveal a set of jagged white scars. \"This\u0027un did this to me,\" he said, \"when he turned felon. But I brought him back, nursed him, and trained him special, because he has the spirit, see, and the spirit\u0027s everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much?\" Pierce said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohnson glanced at the scars on his arm. \"This\u0027un I was saving---\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Couldn\u0027t let him go for less\u0027n fifty quid, beg pardon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will give you forty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sold,\" Johnson said quickly. \"You\u0027ll take \u0027im now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Pierce said. \"I\u0027ll call for him soon. For the moment, hold him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you\u0027ll be putting a little something down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will,\" Pierce said, and gave the man ten pounds. Then he had him pry open the dog\u0027s jaws, and he checked the teeth; and then he departed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn me,\" Johnson said after he had gone. \"Man buys a made dog, then leaves him. What\u0027re we up to today?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-great-train-robbery/page-9.html","bookId":2678,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:35 AM"}
