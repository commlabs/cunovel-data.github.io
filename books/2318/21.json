Fortunately, there’s also a historical precedent for employing you. Are you familiar with it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The town-tamer,” Castle muttered\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The town-tamer. An invention of the American West. The man who cleans up a town for a fee. The man who waives legality when legality must inevitably be abandoned. The man who uses a gun instead of a badge when guns are effective and badges are impotent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For a fee.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For a fee,” John Harper echoed. “For a fee of ten thousand dollars, in this instance. Ten thousand dollars to rid the world and the town of Arlington of four men. Four malignant men, four little cancers. Baron and Milani and Hallander and Ross.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just four?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just four. When the rats die, the mice scatter. Kill four. Kill Lou Baron and Joe Milani and Albert Hallander and Mike Ross. Then the back of the gang will be broken. The rest will run for their lives. The town will breathe clean air again. And the town needs clean air, Mr. Castle, needs it desperately. You may rest assured of that. You are doing more than earning a generous fee. You are performing a service for humanity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCastle shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m serious,” Harper said. “I know your reputation. You’re not a hired killer, sir. You are the twentieth-century version of the town-tamer. I respect you as I could never respect a hired killer. You are performing an important service, sir. I respect you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCastle lit a cigarette. “The fee,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ten thousand dollars. And I’m paying it entirely in advance, Mr. Castle. Because, as I have said, your reputation has preceded you. You’ll have no trouble with the local police, but there are always state troopers to contend with. You might wish to leave Arlington in a hurry when the job is finished. As I understand it, the customary method of payment is half in advance and the remaining half upon completion of the job at hand. I trust you, Mr. Castle. I am paying the full sum in advance. You come well recommended.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCastle took the envelope, slipped it into an inside jacket pocket. It made a bulge there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Baron and Milani and Hallander and Ross,” the old man said, “four fish. Shoot them in a barrel, Mr. Castle. Shoot them and kill them. They are a disease, a plague.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCastle nodded. “That’s all?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That is all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe interview was over. Castle stood up and let Harper show him to the door. He walked quickly to his car and drove off into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaron and Milani and Hallander and Ross.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCASTLE HAD NEVER MET THEM but he knew them all. Small fish, little boys setting up a little town for a little fortune. They were not big men. They didn’t have the guts or the brains to play in Chicago or New York or Vegas. They knew their strengths and their limitations. And they cut a nice pie for themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArlington, Ohio. Population forty-seven thousand. Three small manufacturing concerns, two of them owned by John Harper. One bank, owned by John Harper. Stores and shops, doctors and lawyers. Shopkeepers, workers, professional men, housewives, clerks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, for the first time, criminals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLou Baron and Joe Milani and Albert Hallander and Mike Ross. And, as a direct result of their presence, a bucketful of hustlers on Lake Street, a handful of horse drops on Main and Limestone, a batch of numbers-runners, and a boatload of muscle to make sure everything moved according to plan. Money being drained from Arlington, people being exploited in Arlington, Arlington turning slowly but surely into the private property of four men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaron and Milani and Hallander and Ross.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCastle drove to his hotel, went to his room, put ten thousand dollars in his suitcase. He took out a gun, a .45 automatic which could not be traced farther than a St. Louis pawnshop, and slipped the loaded gun into the pocket which had held the ten thousand dollars. The gun made the jacket sag a bit too much and he took out the gun, took off the jacket, and strapped on a shoulder holster. The gun fit better this way. With the jacket on, the gun bulged only slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaron and Milani and Hallander and Ross. Four small fish in a pond too big for them. Ten thousand dollars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEVENING.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA warm night in Arlington. A full moon, no stars, temperature around seventy. Humidity high. Castle walked down Center Street, his car at the hotel, his gun in its holster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was working. There were four to be taken and he was taking them in order. Lou Baron was first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLou Baron. Short and fat and soft. A beetle from Kansas City, a soft man who had no place in Kerrigan’s K.C. mob. A big wheel in Arlington. A man employing women, a pimp on a large scale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFilth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCastle waited for Baron. He walked to Lake Street and found a doorway where the shadows eclipsed the moon. And waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaron came out of 137 Lake Street a few minutes after nine. Fat and soft, wearing expensive clothes. Laughing, because they took good care of Baron at 137 Lake Street. They had no choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaron walked alone. Castle waited, waited until the small fat man had passed him on the way to a long black car. Then the gun came out of the holster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Baron—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little man turned around. Castle’s finger tightened on the trigger. There was a loud noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bullet went into Baron’s mouth and came out of the back of his head. The bullet had a soft nose and there was a bigger hole on the way out than on the way in. Castle holstered the gun, walked away in the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMILANI WAS EASY. Milani lived in a frame house with his wife. That amused Castle, the notion that Milani was a property owner in Arlington. It was funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilani ran numbers in St. Louis, crossed somebody, pulled out. He was too small to chase. The local people let him alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow people ran numbers for him in Arlington. A change of pace. And Milani’s wife, a St. Louis tramp with big breasts and no brains, helped Milani spend his money that stupid people bet on three-digit numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilani was easy. He was home and the door was locked. Castle rang the bell. And Milani, safe and secure and self-important, did not bother with peepholes. He opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd caught a .45-caliber bullet over the heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo down and two to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHALLANDER WAS A GUN MAN. Castle didn’t know much about him, just a few rumbles that made their way over the coast-to-coast grapevine. Little things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gun, a torpedo, a zombie. A bodyguard out of Chi who goofed too many times. A killer who loved to kill, a little man with dead eyes who was nude without a gun. A psychopath. So many killers were psychopaths. Castle hated them with the hatred of the businessman for the competitive hobbyist. Killing Baron and Milani had been on the order of squashing cockroaches under the heel of a heavy shoe. Killing Hallander was a pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHallander did not live in a house like Milani or go to women like Baron. Hallander had no use for women, only for a gun. He lived alone in a small apartment on the outskirts of town. His car, four years old, was parked in his garage. He could have afforded a better car. But to Hallander, money was not to be spent. It was chips in a poker game. He held onto his chips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was well protected—a doorman screened visitors, an elevator operator knew whom he took upstairs. But Hallander made no friends. Five dollars quieted the doorman forever. Five dollars sealed the lips of the elevator operator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCastle knocked on Hallander’s door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA peephole opened. A peephole closed. Hallander drew a gun and fired through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd missed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCastle shot the lock off, kicked the door open. Hallander missed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a bullet in the throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator operator took Castle back to the first floor. The doorman passed him through to the street. He got into his car, turned the key in the ignition, drove back to the center of Arlington.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust one more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“WE CAN DEAL,” Mike Ross said. “You got your money. You hit three out of four. You can leave me be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCastle said nothing. They were alone, he and Ross. The brains of the Arlington enterprise sat in an easy chair with a slow smile on his face. He knew about Baron and Milani and Hallander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You did a job already,” Ross said. “You got paid already. You want money? Fifteen thousand. Cash. Then you disappear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCastle shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not? Hot-shot Harper won’t sue you. You’ll have his ten grand and fifteen of mine and you’ll disappear. Period. No trouble, no sweat, no nothing. Nobody after you looking to even things up. Tell you the truth, I’m glad to see the three of them out of the way. More for me and no morons getting in the way. I’m glad you took them. Just so you don’t take me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve got a job to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Twenty grand. Thirty. What’s a man’s life worth? Name your price, Castle. Name it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No price.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike Ross laughed. “Everybody has a price. Everybody. You aren’t that special. I can buy you, Castle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoss bought death. He bought one bullet and death came at once. He fell on his face and died. Castle wiped off the gun, flipped it onto the floor. He had taken chances, using the same gun four times. But the four times had taken less than one night. Morning had not come yet. The Arlington police force still slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped the gun to the floor and got out of there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA PHONE RANG IN CHICAGO. A man lifted it, held it to his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Castle,” a voice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Job done?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How many hits?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Four of them,” Castle said. “Four off the top.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give me the picture.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The machinery is there with nobody to run it,” Castle said. “The town is lonely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man chuckled. “You’re good,” he said. “You’re very good. We’ll be down tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on in,” Castle said. “The water’s fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePROFESSIONAL KILLER\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHE WAS SITTING ALONE in a hotel room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was, possibly, the most average man in the world. His clothes were carefully chosen to pass in a crowd—dull brown oxfords, a brown gabardine suit, a white shirt, and a slim brown tie. On his head he usually wore an almost shapeless brown felt hat, but the hat now rested on a chair in a corner of the room. He was neither short nor fat nor tall nor thin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven his face was uninteresting. His features were unimpressive in themselves, and they didn’t add up to a distinctive face. He had the usual number of noses, eyes, mouths, and so on—but somehow each feature seemed to be lifted from another dull face, so that he himself possessed no facial character whatsoever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn many professions such a lack of individuality would be a handicap. A salesman without a face has a difficult time making a living. An executive, a merchant—almost anyone has a better chance of success if people remember his face and take notice of him. But the man in the hotel room was very pleased with his nondescript appearance, and did what he could to make himself even less noticeable. In his business it was an asset—perhaps the most important asset he possessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in the hotel room was named Harry Varden. He lived with his wife in a small house in Mamaroneck, in lower Westchester County. He had no children and no close friends. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-night-stands-and-lost-weekends/page-21.html","bookId":2318,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:25 PM"}
