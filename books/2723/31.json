The fact that he was being fake-flirty was the worst part. It was so patronizing, so demeaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me about three seconds before I realized that Taylor wasn\u0027t coming after me. She was inside, laughing at Jeremiah\u0027s dumb jokes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the hallway, Conrad gave me his trademark knowing look and said, \"You know you loved it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared at him. \"How would you know? You\u0027re too obsessed with yourself to notice anybody else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked away from me and said over his shoulder, \"Oh, I notice everything, Belly. Even poor little you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Screw you!\" I said, because that was all I could think of. I could hear him chuckling as he shut his bedroom door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went back to my room and got under the covers. I closed my eyes and replayed and replayed what had just happened. Jeremiah\u0027s lips had touched my lips. My lips were no longer my own. They had been touched. By Jeremiah. I had finally been kissed, and it was my friend Jeremiah who\u0027d been the one to do it. My friend Jeremiah who had been ignoring me that whole week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wished I could talk to Taylor. I wished we could talk about my first kiss, but we couldn\u0027t, because right this minute she was downstairs kissing the same boy who had just kissed me. I was sure of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she came back upstairs an hour later, I pretended I was sleeping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Belly?\" she whispered across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t say anything, but I stirred a little, for effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you\u0027re still awake, Belly,\" she said. \"And I forgive you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to sit right up and say, \"You forgive me? Well, I don\u0027t forgive you, for coming here and ruining my whole summer.\" But I didn\u0027t say any of it. I just kept fake-sleeping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning I woke up early, just after seven, and Taylor was already gone. I knew where she was. She\u0027d gone to watch the sunrise with Jeremiah. We\u0027d been planning to go watch the sunrise on the beach one morning before she left, but we always overslept. It was her second to last morning, and she\u0027d chosen Jeremiah. Figured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI changed into my bathing suit and headed for the pool. In the mornings it was always a little cold outside, just a little bit of bite to the air, but I didn\u0027t mind. Swimming in the mornings made me feel like I was swimming in the ocean even when I wasn\u0027t. In theory swimming in the ocean sounds great and all, but the salt water burned my eyes too much to do it every day. Plus, the pool was more private, more my own. Even though everyone else swam in it too, in the mornings and at night I had it pretty much to myself, besides Susannah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I opened the gate to the pool, I saw my mother sitting in one of the lounge chairs reading a book. Except she wasn\u0027t really reading it. She was more just holding it and staring off into space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Mom,\" I said, more to break her out of her spell than anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up, startled. \"Good morning,\" she said, clearing her throat. \"Did you sleep well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged and dropped my towel onto the chair next to hers. \"I guess,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother shaded her eyes with her hand and looked up at me. \"Are you and Taylor having fun?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tons,\" I said. \"Buckets full.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is Taylor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who knows?\" I said. \"Who cares?\" \"Are you two fighting?\" my mother asked casually. \"No. I\u0027m just starting to wish I hadn\u0027t brung her, is all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Best friends are important. They\u0027re the closest thing to a sister you\u0027ll ever have,\" she told me. \"Don\u0027t squander it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIrritably I said, \"I haven\u0027t squandered anything. Why do you always have to put the blame on me for everything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not blaming you. Why must you always make things about you, dear?\" My mother smiled at me in her infuriatingly calm way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes and jumped backward into the pool. It was freezing cold. When I came up to the surface, I yelled, \"I don\u0027t!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I started my laps, and whenever I thought about Taylor and Jeremiah, I got madder and pushed harder. By the time I was done, my shoulders burned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother had left, but Taylor and Jeremiah and Steven were just coming in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Belly, if you swim too much, you\u0027ll get those broad swimmer\u0027s shoulders,\" Taylor warned, dipping her foot in the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored her. What did Taylor know about exercise? She thought walking around the mall in high heels was exercise. \"Where were you guys?\" I asked, floating on my back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just hanging out,\" Jeremiah said vaguely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudas, I thought. A bunch of Benedict Arnolds. \"Where\u0027s Conrad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who knows? He\u0027s too cool to hang out,\" Jeremiah said, falling onto a lounge chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He went running,\" Steven said, a tad defensively. \"He has to get in shape for football season. He has to leave for practice next week, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered. That year Conrad had to leave early so he could get back in time for tryouts. He\u0027d never seemed like the football type to me, but there he was, trying out for the team. I guessed Mr. Fisher had a lot to do with it; he was exactly the type. So was Jeremiah. Although he\u0027d never take it seriously. He never took anything seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll probably play for the team next year too,\" Jeremiah said casually. He sneaked a peek at Taylor to see if she looked impressed. She didn\u0027t. She wasn\u0027t even looking at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis shoulders sagged a little, and I felt sorry for him despite myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Jere, race me, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged and stood up, taking off his shirt. Then he walked over to the deep end and dove in. \"You want a handicap?\" he asked when he emerged up top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I think I can beat you without one,\" I said, paddling over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoo-hoo! Let\u0027s see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe raced across the length of the pool, freestyle, and he beat me the first time, and then the second. But I wore him down by the third and fourth and beat him too. Taylor cheered me on, which only annoyed me more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning she was gone again. This time, though, I was gonna join them. It wasn\u0027t like she and Jeremiah owned the beach. I had just as much right as they did to watch the sunrise. I got up, put my clothes on, and headed outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t see them at first. They were farther down than usual, and they had their backs to me. He had his arms around her, and they were kissing. They weren\u0027t even watching the sunrise. And ... it wasn\u0027t Jeremiah, either. It was Steven. My brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was just like in those movies with the surprise ending, where everything falls into place and clicks. Suddenly my life had become The Usual Suspects , and Taylor, Taylor was Keyser Soze. The scenes ran through the mind-- Taylor and Steven bickering, the way he had come to the boardwalk that night, Taylor claiming that Claire Cho had cankles, all the afternoons she\u0027d spent at my house. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-31.html","bookId":2723,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:12 PM"}
