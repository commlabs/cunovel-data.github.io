SIMON.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Once past Versailles, and St. Cyr was almost reached, the horse which Martin Ashurst had ordered to be made ready for him that morning bearing its rider easily and pleasantly along. Almost reached, yet still a league off, wherefore the young man once more set about collecting his thoughts ere that distance should be compassed. Arranged once more in his own mind the manner in which he would approach \"Madame,\" if she would consent to receive him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After much consideration, after remembering, or perhaps it should better be said never forgetting, that what he was about to do might so envelop him in perils that his life would not be worth a day\u0027s--nay, an hour\u0027s--purchase, he had decided that he would be frank and truthful--that was it, frank and truthful--before this woman who was now the king\u0027s wife, this woman who held the destinies of all in France in the hollow of her hand almost as much as they were held in the hand of Louis.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He would plainly tell what he knew, or thought he knew; would seek confirmation of that knowledge from her into whose house, to whose presence, he was determined, if possible, to penetrate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e If she would consent to receive him!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Only--would she?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He knew that, by all report, even by such gossip as penetrated as far as London, where she was much discussed in not only political but also general circles, an audience with her was as difficult to be obtained as with Le Dieudonné himself; that, with few exceptions, none outside the charmed circle of the royal children, her own creatures, and her own ecclesiastics, were ever able to penetrate to her presence. Nay, had he not even heard it said that those on whom she poured benefits could never even obtain a sight of her? that her especial favourites, the Duchesse du Maine, the brilliant Marshals Villars, Tallard, and d\u0027Harcourt, could get audience of her only with difficulty? And these were her friends, and he was--she might well deem that he was--her enemy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All the same he was resolved to see her if it were possible.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His dead kinswoman had been her friend, surely his passport was there--in that.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He reached the outer gate of St. Cyr even as the clock set high above it struck one, and addressing himself to a soberly clad man servant, who was standing by the half-open gateway which led into a courtyard, he asked calmly if \"Madame\" was visible--if it was permissible for him to see her?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then, at first, he feared that he had indeed come upon a bootless errand, for the grave and decorous servitor showed in his face so deep an astonishment at the request, so blank an appearance of surprise, that he thought the answer about to issue from the man\u0027s lips could be none other than one of flat refusal.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Madame,\" he answered, in, however, a most respectful tone, \"sees no one without an appointment. If monsieur has that she will doubtless receive him, or if he bears a message either from his Majesty or the Duc du Maine. Otherwise----\" and he shrugged his shoulders expressively.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have none such,\" Martin replied, \"nor have I any appointment. Yet I earnestly desire to see Madame. I am the nephew of--of--the Princesse de Rochebazon, who died yesterday. She was Madame\u0027s friend. If I can be received upon that score I shall be grateful.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At once he saw that, as it had been before--upon, for instance, his journey from the coast toward Paris--so it was now. That name, his connection with that great and illustrious family, opened barriers which might otherwise have been closed firmly against him, removed obstacle after obstacle as they presented themselves.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The look upon the man\u0027s face became not more respectful, since that was impossible, but less hard, less inflexible; then he said:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If monsieur will give himself the trouble to dismount and enter the courtyard his name shall be forwarded to Madame. Whether she will receive monsieur it is impossible for me to say. Madame is now about to take her déje?ner d\u0027après midi. But the name shall be sent.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Therefore Martin Ashurst, feeling that at least he was one step nearer to what he desired, dismounted from his horse, and resigning it to a stableman who was summoned, entered the courtyard of the chateau, or institution, as it was more often termed, of St. Cyr. An institution where the strange woman who ruled over it brought up and educated, and sometimes dowered, the daughters of the nobility and gentry to whom she considered something was due from her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At first he thought this courtyard had been constructed in imitation of some tropical garden or hothouse, so oppressive was the heat caused in it by the total exclusion of all air--a heat so great that here rich exotics grew in tubs as they might have grown in the soil of those far distant lands, notably Siam, from which they had been brought by missionaries as presents to their all-powerful mistress. Then he remembered that among other things peculiar to this woman was her love of warmth and her hatred of fresh air--perhaps the only subject on which she was at variance with Louis. And sitting there in the warm, sickly atmosphere, waiting to know what reception, if any, might be accorded him, he wondered how the king, whose love of open windows and of the cool breezes which blew across the woods and forests of his various palaces and chateaux was proverbial, could ever contrive to pass as much of his life as he did in the confined and vaporous air which perpetually surrounded his wife.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As thus he reflected there came toward him an elderly lady, preceded by the servitor who had received him--a woman dressed in total black, whom at first he thought might be Madame de Maintenon herself, would have felt sure that it was she had not the newcomer, bowed--nay, courtesied to him--as she drew; near, while she spoke in a tone of civil deference which he scarcely thought one so highly placed as the king\u0027s unacknowledged wife would have used.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Madame will receive monsieur,\" this lady said very quietly, in a soft, almost toneless voice, \"if he will follow me. Also she will be pleased if he will join her at her déje?ner.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is Mademoiselle Balbien,\" the servitor said, by way of introduction of this ancient dame, \"Madame\u0027s most cherished attendant.\" Whereon Martin bowed to the other with a grace which she, \"attendant\" though she might be, returned with as much ease as though her life had been passed in courts from the days of her long-forgotten infancy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Monsieur may have heard of me,\" the old lady chirped pleasantly as now she motioned Martin to follow her, smiling, too, while she spoke. \"The Princesse de Rochebazon knew me very well indeed--alas, poor lady, and she is dead!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Yes, Martin had heard of her, and from his aunt, too, as well as others. Had heard of her deep devotion to the woman who now ruled not only France but France\u0027s king--had heard, in truth, that the De Maintenon might have been dead long years ago of starvation, of bitter, pinching want, had it not been for this faithful creature. Had heard his aunt tell, when inclined to gossip, of how Nanon Balbien had taken Scarron\u0027s widow to her garret after the death of the bankrupt and poverty-stricken poet; had shared her bed and her daily meal--generally a salted herring and some bread--with the woman now omnipotent in France; had preserved her life thereby and prevented her succumbing to cold and destitution and starvation. Knew, too, that there were those in France who said that in so doing Nanon Balbien had unwittingly perpetrated the greatest sin, the greatest evil, against the land that was possible. That it would have been better had she left the object of her charity to die in the gutters of the street than to preserve her life, and thereby raise up and nourish the snake which sucked the life blood from France and all within it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Still following this old woman, through corridors from which all air was as equally excluded as from the glass-roofed courtyard they had left--corridors, too, in which there stood in niches alabaster busts of saints, and one, with above it a sacred light, of the Figure itself--Martin Ashurst went on, until at last he and his conductor neared a huge ebony door the handle of which was of massive silver and representing an angel\u0027s head--a door outside which there stood four ladies in waiting, all dressed in black, none of them young, and one only passably good-looking, yet whom he divined to be women of the oldest and best blood in France, and divined rightly, too. Three of them were high-born noblemen\u0027s daughters, one the daughter of a prince--De Rohan.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mademoiselle de Rochechouart,\" said Martin\u0027s guide, \"this is the gentleman. Will you conduct him to Madame?\" and she drew back now, resigning the visitor to the lady whom she addressed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Come, monsieur,\" that lady said, her voice soft and low, \"follow me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A moment later and he stood before the marvellous woman, the Protestant woman born in a prison, now a bigoted papist and a king\u0027s wife. Yet Martin remembered only at the moment the words of his dead kinswoman, \"Madame knows it.\" Remembered, too, how she had said of her that she was one who would never tell.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Almost he thought that she had but just risen from the prie Dieu which stood beneath another figure of the Saviour that was placed in a niche here, as was its fellow in the corridor; that she had been engaged in prayer while awaiting the moment when he should be conducted to her presence. Thought so, yet doubted. For if she knew, if she divined upon what errand he had come, would she, even she, this reputed mask of duplicity, of self-righteous deceit, be praying on her knees at such a moment? Or, for so also he thought in that swift instant, was she seeking for guidance, beseeching her God to cleanse and purify her heart, to give her grace to speak and to reveal the truth?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But now she stood there calm, erect, notwithstanding her sixty-five years of life, waiting for him to be brought to her, for his approach. Yet not defiantly or arrogantly--only waiting.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The murmured words of Mademoiselle de Rochechouart served as introduction; the courtly bow of Martin Ashurst made acknowledgment of his presentation, then she spoke:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My tears, my prayers, my supplications for Aurore de Rochebazon,\" she said--and he marvelled that her voice was so low and sweet, he having imagined, he knew not why, that it should be harsh and bitter--\"have been offered up many times since I have heard of her death. Monsieur, I accept as a favour at your hands that you have ridden from Paris to see me here. Doubtless you knew that I should be soothed to hear of the end she made. Is it not so, monsieur?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is so to some extent, madame. Yet, if you will be so gracious, there are other matters on which I shall crave leave to address you, if I have your permission.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You shall have full permission to speak as it may please you. Yet, first, you have ridden from Paris. Also it is my hour for the midday repast. Monsieur,\" and she put out her silk mittened hand, \"your arm.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And taking it she led him through a heavily-curtained door into an adjoining room. Within that room, sombrely furnished, dark, too, and somewhat dismal because of the ebony fittings and adornments, was a table with covers for two. Also upon it a silver gong. And, alone to relieve the gloom of all around, there stood upon it also a rich épergne, filled almost to overflowing with rich luscious fruit--peaches, choice grapes, and nectarines.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At first Madame said nothing, or little, to Martin Ashurst beyond the ordinary speech of a courteous hostess to a stranger guest; also Mademoiselle de Rochechouart and a waiting maid were always present, the former standing behind the mistress\u0027s chair and directing the latter by a glance. But at last the déje?ner drew to a conclusion, the meal of few but extremely choice plats was finished, and two little handleless cups of coffee (which Madame de Maintenon never concluded any meal whatever without) were placed in front of hostess and guest. Then they were alone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now,\" she said, her deep eyes fixed upon Martin, \"now tell me of the end which Aurore de Rochebazon made. Tell me all--all--her last words. They were those of one at peace, I pray.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her voice was sweet and low as she spoke, yet not more calm than that of the man who sat before her, as he answered:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Madame, it is to tell you of her last words that I have sought your presence. Yet, alas----\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Alas!\" she repeated quickly. \"Alas! Why do you say that? Alas--what?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Her last words were scarce those of peace. Instead, the words of one whose end was not peaceful; of one who wandered--was distraught--or revealed in her dying moments a secret that should have been divulged long, years ago.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The ivory of his listener\u0027s face did not become whiter as he spoke, neither to her cheeks did any blood mantle. There was no sign that in the mind of this, woman, marble alike in look and heart, was any knowledge of what the revealed secret was, or only one such sign. A duller glance from the deep sunken eyes, as though a film had risen before them and hidden them from him who gazed at her. Then she said:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Doubtless she wandered. Was distraught, as you say.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Nay, madame. For she left behind her proofs--letters--testifying----\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That my aunt was not the Princesse de Rochebazon. That, instead, she and her husband usurped a position which was never theirs. That a deep wrong had been done which must, which shall be, righted.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"By whom?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"By me, with God\u0027s grace.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e * * * * * * *\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The night was falling as he rode back to Paris and entered the city by the western gate, making his way to the Rue Champfleury.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Yet neither the challenge of the guet at the barrier nor the noise inside it when once he was within the city, nor the crowd waiting outside a theatre to witness a revival of L\u0027écolier de Salamanque, which was the production of the poor decayed creature who had been the first husband of the inscrutable woman he had visited that day, had power to rouse him from his thoughts, nor to drive from out his memory her last words:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Even if all this were true you will never find him.
