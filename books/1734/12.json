Idly, he let the tip of one wing graze the planet Mars, which, being of mere matter, was unaffected by the contact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"It\u0027s a settled matter, Etheriel. There\u0027s nothing to be done about it now. The Day of Resurrection is due.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEtheriel, a very junior seraph who had been created not quite a thousand years earlier as men counted time, quivered so that distinct vortices appeared in the continuum. Ever since his creation, he had been in immediate charge of Earth and environs. As a job, it was a sinecure, a cubbyhole, a dead end, but through the centuries he had come to take a perverse pride in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027ll be disrupting my world without notice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all. Not at all. Certain passages occur in the Book of Daniel and in the Apocalypse of St. John which are clear enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are? Having been copied from scribe to scribe? I wonder if two words in a row are left unchanged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are hints in the Rig-Veda, in the Confucian Analects-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which are the property of isolated cultural groups which exist as a thin aristocracy-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Gilgamesh Chronicle speaks out plainly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Much of the Gilgamesh Chronicle was destroyed with the library of Ashurbanipal sixteen hundred years, Earth-style, before my creation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are certain features of the Great Pyramid and a pattern in the inlaid jewels of the Taj Mahal-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which are so subtle that no man has ever rightly interpreted them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel said wearily, \"If you\u0027re going to object to everything, there\u0027s no fiSe discussing the matter.

It took all my efforts to curb him, and even so-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, yes\"-Gabriel stroked a comet as it passed-\"he does seem to have won his little victories. I note as I let the interlocking factual pattern of this miserable little world flow through me that this is one of those setups with matter-energy equivalence.\" i i \"So it is,\" said Etheriel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they are playing with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what better time for ending the matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be able to handle it, I assure you.

The appointed moment approaches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe seraph said stubbornly, \"I would like to see the documents in the case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you insist.\" The wording of an Act of Ascendancy appeared in glittering symbols against the deep black of the airless firmament.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEtheriel read aloud: \"It is hereby directed by order of Council that the Archangel Gabriel, Serial number etcetera, etcetera (well, that\u0027s you, at any rate), will approach Planet, Class A, number G753990, hereinafter known as Earth, and on January 1, 1957, at 12:01 p.m., using local time values-\" He finished reading in gloomy silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Satisfied?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I\u0027m helpless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel smiled. A trumpet appeared in space, in shape like an earthly trumpet, but its burnished gold extended from Earth to sun. It was raised to Gabriel\u0027s glittering beautiful lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t you let me have a little time to take this up with the Council?\" asked Etheriel desperately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What good would it do you? The act is countersigned by the Chief, and you know that an act countersigned by the Chief is absolutely irrevocable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now, if you don\u0027t mind, it is almost the stipulated second and I want to be done with this as I have other matters of much greater moment on my mind. Would you step out of my way a little? Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel blew, and a clean, thin sound of perfect pitch and crystalline delicacy filled all the universe to the furthest star. As it sounded, there was a tiny moment of stasis as thin as the line separating past from future, and then the fabric of worlds collapsed upon itself and matter was gathered back into the primeval chaos from which it had once sprung at a word. The stars and nebulae were gone, and the cosmic dust, the sun, the planets, the moon; all, all, all except Earth itself, which spun as before in a universe now completely empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Last Trump had sounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR. E. Mann, (known to all who knew him simply as R.E.) eased himself into the offices: of the Billikan Bitsies factory and stared somberly at the tall man (gaunt but with a certain faded elegance about his neat gray mustache) who bent intently over a sheaf of papers on his desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR.E. looked at his wristwatch, which still said 7:01, having ceased running at that time. It was Eastern standard time, of course; 12:01 p.m. Greenwich time. His dark brown eyes, staring sharply out over a pair of pronounced cheekbones, caught those of the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, the tall man stared at him blankly. Then he said, \"Can I do anything for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Horatio J. Billikan, I presume? Owner of this place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m R. E. Mann and I couldn\u0027t help but stop in when I finally found someone at work.

I heard the blast. Fit to wake the dead. . . . That\u0027s rather a good one, don\u0027t you think?\" He chuckled for a moment, then went on. \"It woke me at seven in the morning. I nudged my wife. She slept through it, of \"course. I always said she would. \u0027It\u0027s the Last Trump, dear,\u0027 I said. Hortense, that\u0027s my wife, said, \u0027All right,\u0027 and went back to sleep. I bathed, shaved, dressed and came to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why?\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None of yoour workers have come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, poor sjouls.

It: gives me a chance to straighten out my personal correspondence without interruptions. Telephone hasn\u0027t rung once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood u;,p and went to the window. \"It\u0027s a great improvement. No blinding sun amy more and the snow\u0027s gone.

Wherever did you come from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From the graveyard,\" roared Billikan, Senior. \"Where on Earth else? They\u0027re coming out of the ground there by the dozens. Every one of them naked. Women, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBillikan cleared his throat. \"I\u0027ll get you some clothes, Father. I\u0027ll bring them to you from home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind that. Business first. Business first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR.E. came out of his musing. \"Is everyone coming out of their graves at the same time, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared curiously at Billikan, Senior, as he spoke. The old man\u0027s appearance was one of robust age. His cheeks were furrowed but glowed with health. His age, R.E. decided, was exactly what it was at the moment of his death, but his body was as it should have been at that age if it functioned ideally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBillikan, Senior, said, \"No, sir, they are not. The newer graves are coming up first. Pottersby died five years before me and came up about five minutes after me. Seeing him made me decide to leave. I had had enough of him when . . . And that reminds me.\" He brought his fist down on the desk, a very solid fist. \"There were no taxis, no busses. Telephones weren\u0027t working. I had to walk. I had to walk twenty miles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like that?\" asked his son in a faint and appalled voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBillikan, Senior, looked down upon his bare skin with casual approval. \"It\u0027s warm. Almost everyone else is naked. . . . Anyway, son, I\u0027m not here to make small talk. Why is the factory shut down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t shut down. It\u0027s a special occasion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Special occasion, my foot. You call union headquarters and tell them Resurrection Day isn\u0027t in the contract. Every worker is being docked for every minute he\u0027s off the job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBillikan\u0027s lean face took on a stubborn look as he peered at his father. \"I will not. Don\u0027t forget, now, you\u0027re no longer in charge of this plant. I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you are? By what right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By your will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. Now here I am and I void my will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t, Father.

I can get testimony from the pallbearers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBillikan, Senior, stared at his son, sat down, placed his arm over the back of the chair, crossed his iegs and said, \"If it conies to that, we\u0027re all dead, aren\u0027t we? The world\u0027s come to an end, hasn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027ve been declared legally dead and 1 haven\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, we\u0027ll change that, son. There are going to be more of us than of you and votes count.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBillikan, Junior, tapped the desk firmly with the flat of his hand and flushed slightly. \"Father, I hate to bring up this particular point, but you force me to. May I remind you that by now 1 am sure that Mother is sitting at home waiting for you; that she probably had to walk the streets-uh- naked, too; and that she probably isn\u0027t in a good humor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBillikan, Senior, went ludicrously pale. \"Good Heavens!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you know she always wanted you to retire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBillikan, Senior, came to a quick decision. \"I\u0027m not going home. Why, this is a nightmare. Aren\u0027t there any limits to this Resurrection business? It\u0027s -it\u0027s-it\u0027s sheer anarchy. There\u0027s such a thing as overdoing it. I\u0027m just not going home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt which point, a somewhat rotund gentleman with a smooth, pink face and fluffy white sideburns (much like pictures of Martin Van Buren) stepped in and said coldly, \"Good day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Father,\" said Billikan, Senior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grandfather,\" said Billikan, Junior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBillikan, Grandsenior, looked at Billikan, Junior, with disapproval. \"If you are my grandson,\" he said, \"you\u0027ve aged considerably and the change has not improved you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBillikan, Junior, smiled with dyspeptic feebleness, and made no answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBillikan, Grandsenior, did not seem to require one. He said, \"Now if you two will bring me up to date on the business, I will resume my managerial function.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were two simultaneous answers, and Billikan, Grandsenior\u0027s, florid-ity waxed dangerously as he beat the ground peremptorily with an imaginary cane and barked a retort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR.E. said, \"Gentlemen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his voice. \"Gentlemen!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrieked at full long-power, \"GENTLEMEN!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConversation snapped off sharply and all turned to look at him. R.E.\u0027s angular face, his oddly attractive eyes, his sardonic mouth seemed suddenly to dominate the gathering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"I don\u0027t understand this argument. What is it that you manufacture?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bitsies,\" said Billikan, Junior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which, I take it, are a packaged cereal breakfast food-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Teeming with energy in every golden, crispy flake-\" cried Billikan, Junior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Covered with honey-sweet, crystalline sugar; a confection and a food- growled Billikan, Senior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To tempt the most jaded appetite,\" roared Billikan, Grandsenior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly,\" said R.E. \"What appetite?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stared stolidly at him. \"I beg your pardon,\" said Billikan, Junior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are any of you hungry?\" asked R.E. \"I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is this fool maundering about?\" demanded Billikan, Grandsenior, angrily. His invisible cane would have been prodding R.E. in the navel had it (the cane, not the navel) existed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR.E. said, \"I\u0027m trying to tell you that no one will ever eat again.

It was obvious that they had tried their own appetites and found them wanting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBillikan, Junior, said ashenly, \"Ruined!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBillikan, Grandsenior, pounded the floor heavily and noiselessly with his imaginary cane. \"This is confiscation of property without due process of law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll sue.

Quietly he thought of the hospitals. Thousands of babies must be appearing at each one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlace them in racks, he thought, sardonically. Stack them like cordwood. They need no care. Their little bodies are merely each the custodian of an indestructible spark of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe passed two little boys of apparently equal chronological age, perhaps ten. Their voices were shrill. The body of one glistened white in the sunless light so he was a returnee. The other was not. R.E. paused to listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bare one said, \"I had scarlet fever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA spark of envy at the other\u0027s claim to notoriety seemed to enter the clothed one\u0027s voice. \"Gee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why I died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gee.

Those who were left were all walking into town, all were nude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man stopped him; a cheerful man with pinkish skin and white hair who had the marks of pince-nez on either side of the bridge of his nose, but no glasses to go with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Greetings, friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello,\" said R.E.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the first man with clothing that I\u0027ve seen.

We are surrounded by the light of the first day; the light that glowed softly and serenely before sun, moon and stars were made. (You know your Genesis, of course.) There is the comfortable warmth that must have been one of the highest blisses of Eden; not enervating heat or assaulting cold. Men and women walk the streets unclothed and are not ashamed. All is well, my friend, all is well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR.E. said, \"Well, it\u0027s a fact that I haven\u0027t seemed to mind the feminine display all about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naturally not,\" said the other. \"Lust and sin as we remember it in our earthly existence no longer exists.

He found the cemetery itself all but empty, its trees and grass gone (it occurred to him that there was nothing green in the world; the ground everywhere was a hard, featureless, grainless gray; the sky a luminous white), but its headstones still standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn one of these sat a lean and furrowed man with long, black hair on his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehead and a mat of it, shorter, though more impressive, on his chest and upper arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe called out in a deep voice, \"Hey, there, you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR.E. sat down on a neighboring headstone. \"Hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack-hair said, \"Your clothes don\u0027t look right.

Instead, he said, \"The town\u0027s grown in a hundred fifty years, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Country, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forty-eight states,\" said R.E. \"All the way to the Pacific.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Zeb slapped his thigh in delight and then winced at the unexpected absence of rough homespun to take up the worst of the blow. \"I\u0027d head out west if I wasn\u0027t needed here. Yes, sir.\" His face grew lowering and his thin lips took on a definite grimness. \"I\u0027ll stay right here, where I\u0027m needed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you needed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe explanation came out briefly, bitten off hard. \"Injuns!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indians?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Millions of \u0027em.

He said, \"You better git back to the city, then. After a while, it ain\u0027t going to be safe nohow round here. Wish I had my musket.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR.E. rose, thought a moment, shrugged and faced back to the city. The headstone he had been sitting upon collapsed as he rose, falling into a powder of gray stone that melted into the featureless ground. He looked about. Most of the headstones were gone. The rest would not last long. Only the one under Zeb still looked firm and strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR.E. began the walk back. Zeb did not turn to look at him. He remained waiting quietly and calmly-for Indians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEtheriel plunged through the heavens in reckless haste. The eyes of the Ascendants were on him, he knew. From late-born seraph, through cherubs and angels, to the highest archangel, they must be watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlready he was higher than any Ascendant, uninvited, had ever been before and he waited for the quiver of the Word that would reduce his vortices to non-existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he did not falter. Through non-space and non-time, he plunged toward union with the Primum Mobile; the seat that encompassed all that Is, Was, Would Be, Had Been, Could Be and Might Be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as he thought that, he burst through and was part of it, his being expanding so that momentarily he, too, was part of the All. But then it was mercifully veiled from his senses, and the Chief was a still, small voice within him, yet all the more impressive in its infinity for all that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My son,\" the voice said, \"I know why you have come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then help me, if that be your will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By my own will,\" said the Chief, \"an act of mine is irrevocable. All your mankind, my son, yearned for life. All feared death. All evolved thoughts and dreams of life unending. No two groups of men; no two single men; evolved the same afterlife, but all wished life. I was petitioned that I might grant the common denominator of all these wishes-life unending. I did so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No servant of yours made that request.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Adversary did, my son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEtheriel trailed his feeble glory in dejection and said in a low voice, \"I am dust in your sight and unworthy to be in your presence, yet I must ask a question. Is then the Adversary your servant also?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Without him I can have no other,\" said the Chief, \"for what then is Good but the eternal fight against Evil?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in that fight, thought Etheriel, I have lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR.E. paused in sight of town. The buildings were crumbling. Those that were made of wood were already heaps of rubble. R.E. walked to the nearest such heap and found the wooden splinters powdery and dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe penetrated deeper into town and found the brick buildings still standing, but there was an ominous roundness to the edges of the bricks, a threatening flakiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They won\u0027t last long,\" said a deep voice, \"but there is this consolation, if consolation it be; their collapse can kill no one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR.E. looked up in surprise and found himself face to face with a cadaverous Don Quixote of a man, lantern-jawed, sunken-cheeked. His eyes were sad and his brown hair was lank and straight. His clothes hung loosely and skin showed clearly through various rents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name,\" said the man, \"is Richard Levine. I was a professor of history once-before this happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wearing clothes,\" said R.E. \"You\u0027re not one of those resurrected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but that mark of distinction is vanishing. Clothes are going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR.E. looked at the throngs that drifted past them, moving slowly and aimlessly like motes in a sunbeam. Vanishingly few wore clothes. He looked down at himself and noticed for the first time that the seam down the length of each trouser leg had parted. He pinched the fabric of his jacket between thumb and forefinger and the wool parted and came away easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess you\u0027re right,\" said R.E.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027ll notice,\" went on Levine, \"Mellon\u0027s Hill is flattening out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR.E. turned to the north where ordinarily the mansions of the aristocracy (such aristocracy as there was in town) studded the slopes of Mellon\u0027s Hill, and found the horizon nearly flat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine said, \"Eventually, there\u0027ll be nothing but flatness, featurelessness, nothingness-and us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Indians,\" said R.E. \"There\u0027s a man outside of town waiting for Indians and wishing he had a musket.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I imagine,\" said Levine, \"the Indians will give no trouble. There is no pleasure in fighting an enemy that cannot be killed or hurt. And even if that were not so, the lust for battle would be gone, as are all lusts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am positive. Before all this happened, although you may not think it to look at me, I derived much harmless pleasure in a consideration of the female figure. Now, with the unexampled opportunities at my disposal, I find myself irritatingly uninterested. No, that is wrong. I am not even irritated at my disinterest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR.E. looked up briefly at the passers-by. \"I see what you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The coming of Indians here,\" said Levine, \"is nothing compared with the situation in the Old World. Early during the Resurrection, Hitler and his Wehrmacht must have come back to life and must now be facing and intermingled with Stalin and the Red Army all the way from Berlin to Stalingrad. To complicate the situation, the Kaisers and Czars will arrive. The men at Verdun and the Somme are back in the old battlegrounds. Napoleon and his marshals are scattered over western Europe. And Mohammed must be back to see what following ages have made of Islam, while the Saints and Apostles consider the paths of Christianity. And even the Mongols, poor things, the Khans from Temujin to Aurangzeb, must be wandering the steppes helplessly, longing for their horses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As a professor of history,\" said R.E., \"you must long to be there and observe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could I be there? Every man\u0027s position on Earth is restricted to the distance he can walk. There are no machines of any kind, and, as I have just mentioned, no horses. And what would I find in Europe anyway? Apathy, I think! As here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA soft plopping sound caused R.E. to turn around. The wing of a neigh-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eboring brick building had collapsed in dust. Portions of bricks lay on either side of him. Some must have hurtled through him without his being aware of it. He looked about. The heaps of rubble were less numerous. Those that remained were smaller in size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"I met a man who thought we had all been judged and are in Heaven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Judged?\" said Levine. \"Why, yes, I imagine we are. We face eternity now. We have no universe left, no outside phenomena, no emotions, no passions. Nothing but ourselves and thought. We face an eternity of introspection, when all through history we have never known what to do with ourselves on a rainy Sunday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound as though the situation bothers you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It does more than that. The Dantean conceptions of Inferno were childish and unworthy of the Divine imagination: fire and torture. Boredom is much more subtle. The inner torture of a mind unable to escape itself in any way, condemned to fester in its own exuding mental pus for all time, is much more fitting. Oh, yes, my friend, we have been judged, and condemned, too, and this is not Heaven, but hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Levine rose with shoulders drooping dejectedly, and walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR.E. gazed thoughtfully about and nodded his head. He was satisfied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe self-admission of failure lasted but an instant in Etheriel, and then, quite suddenly, he lifted his being as brightly and highly as he dared in the presence of the Chief and his glory was a tiny dot of light in the infinite Primum Mobile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it be your will, then,\" he said. \"I do not ask you to defeat your will but to fulfill it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In what way, my son?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The document, approved by the Council of Ascendants and signed by yourself, authorizes the Day of Resurrection at a specific time of a specific day of the year 1957 as Earthmen count time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the year 1957 is unqualified. What then is 1957? To the dominant culture on Earth the year was a.d. 1957. That is true. Yet from the time you breathed existence into Earth and its universe there have passed 5,960 years. Based on the internal evidence you created within that universe, nearly four billion years have passed. Is the year, unqualified, then 1957, 5960, or 4000000000?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nor is that all,\" Etheriel went on. \"The year \\.d. 1957 is the year 7464 of the Byzantine era, 5716 by the Jewish calendar. It is 2708 a.u.c., that is, the 2,708th year since the founding of Rome, if we adopt the Roman calendar. It is the year 1375 in the Mohammedan calendar, and the hundred eightieth year of the independence of the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Humbly I ask then if it does not seem to you that a year referred to as 1957 alone and without qualification has no meaning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chief\u0027s still small voice said, \"I have always known this, my son; it was you who had to learn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then,\" said Etheriel, quivering luminously with joy, \"let the very letter of your will be fulfilled and let the Day of Resurrection fall in 1957, but only when all the inhabitants of Earth unanimously agree that a certain year shall be numbered 1957 and none other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So let it be,\" said the Chief, and this Word re-created Earth and all it contained, together with the sun and moon and all the hosts of Heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was 7 a.m. on January 1, 1957, when R. E. Mann awoke with a start.
