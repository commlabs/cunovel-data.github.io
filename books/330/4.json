Afterthe long flight — chasing the sun westward so that it seemed unmoving in the sky — it was especiallydisorienting; time seemed oddly variable. It took me by surprise when the forest gave way to the first buildings,signaling that we were nearly home.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You’ve been very quiet,” Edward observed. “Did the plane make you sick?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“No, I’m okay.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Are you sad to leave?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“More relieved than sad, I think.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He raised one eyebrow at me. I knew it was useless and — much as I hated to admit it — unnecessary toask him to keep his eyes on the road.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Renée is so much more . . . perceptive than Charlie in some ways. It was making me jumpy.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward laughed. “Your mother has a very interesting mind. Almost childlike, but very insightful. She seesthings differently than other people.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Insightful. It was a good description of my mother — when she was paying attention. Most of the timeRenée was so bewildered by her own life that she didn’t notice much else. But this weekend she’d beenpaying plenty of attention to me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Phil was busy — the high school baseball team he coached was in the playoffs — and being alone withEdward and me had only sharpened Renée’s focus. As soon as the hugs and squeals of delight were out of theway, Renée began to watch. And as she’d watched, her wide blue eyes had become first confused and thenconcerned.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　This morning we’d gone for a walk along the beach. She wanted to show off all the beauties of her newhome, still hoping, I think, that the sun might lure me away from Forks. She’d also wanted to talk with mealone, and that was easily arranged. Edward had fabricated a term paper to give himself an excuse to stayindoors during the day.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　In my head, I went through the conversation again. . . .\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Renée and I ambled along the sidewalk, trying to stay in the range of the infrequent palm tree shadows.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Though it was early, the heat was smothering. The air was so heavy with moisture that just breathing in and outwas giving my lungs a workout.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Bella?” my mother asked, looking out past the sand to the lightly crashing waves as she spoke.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What is it, Mom?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She sighed, not meeting my gaze. “I’m worried. . . .”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What’s wrong?” I asked, anxious at once. “What can I do?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“It’s not me.” She shook her head. “I’m worried about you . . . and Edward.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Renée finally looked at me when she said his name, her face apologetic.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Oh,” I mumbled, fixing my eyes on a pair of joggers as they passed us, drenched with sweat.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You two are more serious than I’d been thinking,” she went on.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I frowned, quickly reviewing the last two days in my head. Edward and I had barely touched — in front ofher, at least. I wondered if Renée was about to give me a lecture on responsibility, too. I didn’t mind that theway I had with Charlie. It wasn’t embarrassing with my mom. After all, I’d been the one giving her that lecturetime and time again in the last ten years.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“There’s something . . . strange about the way you two are together,” she murmured, her foreheadcreasing over her troubled eyes. “The way he watches you — it’s so . . . protective. Like he’s about to throwhimself in front of a bullet to save you or something.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I laughed, though I was still not able to meet her gaze. “That’s a bad thing?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“No.” She frowned as she struggled for the words. “It’s just different. He’s very intense about you . . .\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　and very careful. I feel like I don’t really understand your relationship. Like there’s some secret I’m missing. . .\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　 “I think you’re imagining things, Mom,” I said quickly, struggling to keep my voice light. There was aflutter in my stomach. I’d forgotten how much my mother saw. Something about her simple view of the worldcut through all the distractions and pierced right to the truth of things. This had never been a problem before.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Until now, there had never been a secret I couldn’t tell her.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“It’s not just him.” She set her lips defensively. “I wish you could see how you move around him.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“The way you move — you orient yourself around him without even thinking about it. When he moves,even a little bit, you adjust your position at the same time. Like magnets . . . or gravity. You’re like a . . .\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　satellite, or something. I’ve never seen anything like it.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She pursed her lips and stared down.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Don’t tell me,” I teased, forcing a smile. “You’re reading mysteries again, aren’t you? Or is it sci-fi thistime?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Renée flushed a delicate pink. “That’s beside the point.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Found anything good?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Well, there was one — but that doesn’t matter. We’re talking about you right now.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You should stick to romance, Mom. You know how you freak yourself out.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Her lips turned up at the corners. “I’m being silly, aren’t I?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　For half a second I couldn’t answer. Renée was so easily swayed. Sometimes it was a good thing,because not all of her ideas were practical. But it pained me to see how quickly she caved in to my trivializing,especially since she was dead right this time.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She looked up, and I controlled my expression.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Not silly — just being a mom.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She laughed and then gestured grandly toward the white sands stretching to the blue water.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“And all this isn’t enough to get you to move back in with your silly mom?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I wiped my hand dramatically across my forehead, and then pretended to wring my hair out.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You get used to the humidity,” she promised.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You can get used to rain, too,” I countered.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　She elbowed me playfully and then took my hand as we walked back to her car.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Other than her worries about me, she seemed happy enough. Content. She still looked at Phil with goo-goo eyes, and that was comforting. Surely her life was full and satisfying. Surely she didn’t miss me that much,even now. . . .\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward’s icy fingers brushed my cheek. I looked up, blinking, coming back to the present. He leaneddown and kissed my forehead.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“We’re home, Sleeping Beauty. Time to awake.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　We were stopped in front of Charlie’s house. The porch light was on and the cruiser was parked in thedriveway. As I examined the house, I saw the curtain twitch in the living room window, flashing a line of yellowlight across the dark lawn.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I sighed. Of course Charlie was waiting to pounce.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward must have been thinking the same thing, because his expression was stiff and his eyes remote ashe came to get my door for me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“How bad?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Charlie’s not going to be difficult,” Edward promised, his voice level with no hint of humor. “He missedyou.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　My eyes narrowed in doubt. If that was the case, then why was Edward tensed as if for a battle?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　My bag was small, but he insisted on carrying it into the house. Charlie held the door open for us.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Welcome home, kid!” Charlie shouted like he really meant it. “How was Jacksonville?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Moist. And buggy.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“So Renée didn’t sell you on the University of Florida?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“She tried. But I’d rather drink water than inhale it.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Charlie’s eyes flickered unwillingly to Edward. “Did you have a nice time?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Yes,” Edward answered in a serene voice. “Renée was very hospitable.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“That’s . . . um, good. Glad you had fun.” Charlie turned away from Edward and pulled me in for an unexpected hug.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Impressive,” I whispered in his ear.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He rumbled a laugh. “I really missed you, Bells. The food around here sucks when you’re gone.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I’ll get on it,” I said as he let me go.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Would you call Jacob first? He’s been bugging me every five minutes since six o’clock this morning. Ipromised I’d have you call him before you even unpacked.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I didn’t have to look at Edward to feel that he was too still, too cold beside me. So this was the cause ofhis tension.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Jacob wants to talk to me?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Pretty bad, I’d say. He wouldn’t tell me what it was about — just said it was important.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The phone rang then, shrill and demanding.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“That’s him again, I’d bet my next paycheck,” Charlie muttered.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I got it.” I hurried to the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward followed after me while Charlie disappeared into the living room.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I grabbed the phone mid-ring, and twisted around so that I was facing the wall. “Hello?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You’re back,” Jacob said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　His familiar husky voice sent a wave of wistfulness through me. A thousand memories spun in my head,tangling together — a rocky beach strewn with driftwood trees, a garage made of plastic sheds, warm sodasin a paper bag, a tiny room with one too-small shabby loveseat. The laughter in his deep-set black eyes, thefeverish heat of his big hand around mine, the flash of his white teeth against his dark skin, his face stretchinginto the wide smile that had always been like a key to a secret door where only kindred spirits could enter.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　It felt sort of like homesickness, this longing for the place and person who had sheltered me through mydarkest night.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I cleared the lump from my throat. “Yes,” I answered.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Why didn’t you call me?” Jacob demanded.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　His angry tone instantly got my back up. “Because I’ve been in the house for exactly four seconds andyour call interrupted Charlie telling me that you’d called.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Oh. Sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Sure. Now, why are you harassing Charlie?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I need to talk to you.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Yeah, I figured out that part all by myself. Go ahead.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　There was a short pause.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You going to school tomorrow?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I frowned to myself, unable to make sense of this question. “Of course I am. Why wouldn’t I?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I dunno. Just curious.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Another pause.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“So what did you want to talk about, Jake?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He hesitated. “Nothing really, I guess. I . . . wanted to hear your voice.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Yeah, I know. I’m so glad you called me, Jake. I . . .” But I didn’t know what more to say. I wanted totell him I was on my way to La Push right now. And I couldn’t tell him that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I have to go,” he said abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I’ll talk to you soon, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“But Jake —”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He was already gone. I listened to the dial tone with disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“That was short,” I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Is everything all right?” Edward asked. His voice was low and careful.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I turned slowly to face him. His expression was perfectly smooth — impossible to read.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I don’t know. I wonder what that was about.” It didn’t make sense that Jacob had been houndingCharlie all day just to ask me if I was going to school. And if he’d wanted to hear my voice, then why did hehang up so quickly?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Your guess is probably better than mine,” Edward said, the hint of a smiletugging at the corner of his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Mmm,” I murmured. That was true. I knew Jake inside and out. It shouldn’t be that complicated to figureout his motivations.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　With my thoughts miles away — about fifteen miles away, up the road to La Push — I started combingthrough the fridge, assembling ingredients for Charlie’s dinner. Edward leaned against the counter, and I wasdistantly aware that his eyes were on my face, but too preoccupied to worry about what he saw there.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The school thing seemed like the key to me. That was the only real question Jake had asked. And he hadto be after an answer to something, or he wouldn’t have been bugging Charlie so persistently.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Why would my attendance record matter to him, though?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I tried to think about it in a logical way. So, if I hadn’t been going to school tomorrow, what would be theproblem with that, from Jacob’s perspective? Charlie had given me a little grief about missing a day of schoolso close to finals, but I’d convinced him that one Friday wasn’t going to derail my studies. Jake would hardlycare about that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　My brain refused to come up with any brilliant insights. Maybe I was missing some vital piece ofinformation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　What could have changed in the past three days that was so important that Jacob would break his longstreak of refusing to answer my phone calls and contact me? What difference could three days make?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I froze in the middle of the kitchen. The package of icy hamburger in my hands slipped through my numbfingers. It took me a slow second to miss the thud it should have made against the floor.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward had caught it and thrown it onto the counter. His arms were already around me, his lips at my ear.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What’s wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I shook my head, dazed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Three days could change everything.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Hadn’t I just been thinking about how impossible college was? How I couldn’t be anywhere near peopleafter I’d gone through the painful three-day conversion that would set me free from mortality, so that I couldspend eternity with Edward? The conversion that would make me forever a prisoner to my own thirst. . . .\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Had Charlie told Billy that I’d vanished for three days? Had Billy jumped to conclusions? Had Jacobreally been asking me if I was still human? Making sure that the werewolves’ treaty was unbroken — thatnone of the Cullens had dared to bite a human . . . bite, not kill . . . ?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　But did he honestly think I would come home to Charlie if that was the case?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward shook me. “Bella?” he asked, truly anxious now.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I think . . . I think he was checking,” I mumbled. “Checking to make sure. That I’m human, I mean.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward stiffened, and a low hiss sounded in my ear.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“We’ll have to leave,” I whispered. “Before. So that it doesn’t break the treaty. We won’t ever be able tocome back.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　His arms tightened around me. “I know.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Ahem.” Charlie cleared his voice loudly behind us.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I jumped, and then pulled free of Edward’s arms, my face getting hot. Edward leaned back against thecounter. His eyes were tight. I could see worry in them, and anger.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“If you don’t want to make dinner, I can call for a pizza,” Charlie hinted.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“No, that’s okay, I’m already started.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Okay,” Charlie said. He propped himself against the doorframe, folding his arms.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I sighed and got to work, trying to ignore my audience.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“If I asked you to do something, would you trust me?” Edward asked, an edge to his soft voice.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　We were almost to school. Edward had been relaxed and joking just a moment ago, and now suddenlyhis hands were clenched tight on the steering wheel, his knuckles straining in an effort not to snap it into pieces.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I stared at his anxious expression — his eyes were far away, like he was listening to distant voices.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　My pulse sped in response to his stress, but I answered carefully. “That depends.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　We pulled into the school lot.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I was afraid you would say that.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What do you want me to do, Edward?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　 “I want you to stay in the car.” He pulled into his usual spot and turned the engine off as he spoke. “I wantyou to wait here until I come back for you.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“But . . . why?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　That was when I saw him. He would have been hard to miss, towering over the students the way he did,even if he hadn’t been leaning against his black motorcycle, parked illegally on the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Oh.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Jacob’s face was a calm mask that I recognized well. It was the face he used when he was determined tokeep his emotions in check, to keep himself under control. It made him look like Sam, the oldest of thewolves, the leader of the Quileute pack. But Jacob could never quite manage the perfect serenity Sam alwaysexuded.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I’d forgotten how much this face bothered me. Though I’d gotten to know Sam pretty well before theCullens had come back — to like him, even — I’d never been able to completely shake the resentment I feltwhen Jacob mimicked Sam’s expression. It was a stranger’s face. He wasn’t my Jacob when he wore it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You jumped to the wrong conclusion last night,” Edward murmured. “He asked about school because heknew that I would be where you were. He was looking for a safe place to talk to me. A place with witnesses.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　So I’d misinterpreted Jacob’s motives last night. Missing information, that was the problem. Informationlike why in the world Jacob would want to talk to Edward.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I’m not staying in the car,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward groaned quietly. “Of course not. Well, let’s get this over with.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Jacob’s face hardened as we walked toward him, hand in hand.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I noticed other faces, too — the faces of my classmates. I noticed how their eyes widened as they took inall six foot seven inches of Jacob’s long body, muscled up the way no normal sixteen-and-a-half-year-old everhad been. I saw those eyes rake over his tight black t-shirt — short-sleeved, though the day wasunseasonably cool — his ragged, grease-smeared jeans, and the glossy black bike he leaned against. Theireyes didn’t linger on his face — something about his expression had them glancing quickly away. And Inoticed the wide berth everyone gave him, the bubble of space that no one dared to encroach on.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　With a sense of astonishment, I realized that Jacob looked dangerous to them. How odd.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward stopped a few yards away from Jacob, and I could tell that he was uncomfortable having me soclose to a werewolf. He drew his hand back slightly, pulling me halfway behind his body.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You could have called us,” Edward said in a steel-hard voice.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Sorry,” Jacob answered, his face twisting into a sneer. “I don’t have any leeches on my speed dial.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You could have reached me at Bella’s house, of course.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Jacob’s jaw flexed, and his brows pulled together. He didn’t answer.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“This is hardly the place, Jacob. Could we discuss this later?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Sure, sure. I’ll stop by your crypt after school.” Jacob snorted. “What’s wrong with now?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward looked around pointedly, his eyes resting on the witnesses who were just barely out of hearingrange. A few people were hesitating on the sidewalk, their eyes bright with expectation. Like they were hopinga fight might break out to alleviate the tedium of another Monday morning. I saw Tyler Crowley nudge AustinMarks, and they both paused on their way to class.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I already know what you came to say,” Edward reminded Jacob in voice so low that I could barely makeit out. “Message delivered. Consider us warned.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward glanced down at me for a fleeting second with worried eyes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Warned?” I asked blankly. “What are you talking about?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You didn’t tell her?” Jacob asked, his eyes widening with disbelief. “What, were you afraid she’d takeour side?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Please drop it, Jacob,” Edward said in an even voice.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Why?” Jacob challenged.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I frowned in confusion. “What don’t I know? Edward?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward just glared at Jacob as if he hadn’t heard me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Jake?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Jacob raised his eyebrow at me. “He didn’t tell you that his big . . . brother crossed the line Saturdaynight?” he asked, his tone thickly layered with sarcasm. Then his eyes flickered back to Edward. “Paul was totally justified in —”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“It was no-man’s land!” Edward hissed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Was not!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Jacob was fuming visibly. His hands trembled. He shook his head and sucked in two deep lungfuls of air.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Emmett and Paul?” I whispered. Paul was Jacob’s most volatile pack brother. He was the one who’dlost control that day in the woods — the memory of the snarling gray wolf was suddenly vividin my head.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What happened? Were they fighting?” My voice strained higher in panic. “Why? Did Paul get hurt?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“No one fought,” Edward said quietly, only to me. “No one got hurt. Don’t be anxious.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Jacob was staring at us with incredulous eyes. “You didn’t tell her anything at all, did you? Is that why youtook her away? So she wouldn’t know that —?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Leave now.” Edward cut him off mid-sentence, and his face was abruptly frightening — truly frightening.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　For a second, he looked like . . . like a vampire. He glared at Jacob with vicious, unveiled loathing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Jacob raised his eyebrows, but made no other move. “Why haven’t you told her?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　They faced each other in silence for a long moment. More students gathered behind Tyler and Austin. Isaw Mike next to Ben — Mike had one hand on Ben’s shoulder, like he was holding him in place.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　In the dead silence, all the details suddenly fell into place for me with a burst of intuition.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Something Edward didn’t want me to know.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Something that Jacob wouldn’t have kept from me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Something that had the Cullens and the wolves both in the woods, moving in hazardous proximity to eachother.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Something that would cause Edward to insist that I fly across the country.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Something that Alice had seen in a vision last week — a vision Edward had lied to me about.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Something I’d been waiting for anyway. Something I knew would happen again, as much as I might wish itnever would. It was never going to end, was it?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I heard the quick gasp, gasp, gasp, gasp of the air dragging through my lips, but I couldn’t stop it. Itlooked like the school was shaking, like there was an earthquake, but I knew it was my own trembling thatcaused the illusion.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“She came back for me,” I choked out.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Victoria was never going to give up till I was dead. She would keep repeating the same pattern — feintand run, feint and run — until she found a hole through my defenders.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Maybe I’d get lucky. Maybe the Volturi would come for me first — they’d kill me quicker, at least.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward held me tight to his side, angling his body so that he was still between me and Jacob, and strokedmy face with anxious hands. “It’s fine,” he whispered to me. “It’s fine. I’ll never let her get close to you, it’sfine.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Then he glared at Jacob. “Does that answer your question, mongrel?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“You don’t think Bella has a right to know?” Jacob challenged. “It’s her life.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward kept his voice muted; even Tyler, edging forward by inches, would be unable to hear. “Whyshould she be frightened when she was never in danger?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Better frightened than lied to.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I tried to pull myself together, but my eyes were swimming in moisture. I could see it behind my lids — Icould see Victoria’s face, her lips pulled back over her teeth, her crimson eyes glowing with the obsession ofher vendetta; she held Edward responsible for the demise of her love, James. She wouldn’t stop until his lovewas taken from him, too.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward wiped the tears from my cheek with his fingertips.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Do you really think hurting her is better than protecting her?” he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“She’s tougher than you think,” Jacob said. “And she’s been through worse.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Abruptly, Jacob’s expression shifted, and he was staring at Edward with an odd, speculative expression.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　His eyes narrowed like he was trying to do a difficult math problem in his head.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I felt Edward cringe. I glanced up at him, and his face was contorted in what could only be pain. For oneghastly moment, I was reminded of our afternoon in Italy, in the macabre tower room of the Volturi, whereJane had tortured Edward with her malignant gift, burning him with her thoughts alone. . . .\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The memory snapped me out of my near hysteria and put everything in perspective. Because I’d rather Victoria killed me a hundred times over than watch Edward suffer that way again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“That’s funny,” Jacob said, laughing as he watched Edward’s face.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward winced, but smoothed his expression with a little effort. He couldn’t quite hide the agony in hiseyes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I glanced, wide-eyed, from Edward’s grimace to Jacob’s sneer.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What are you doing to him?” I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“It’s nothing, Bella,” Edward told me quietly. “Jacob just has a good memory, that’s all.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Jacob grinned, and Edward winced again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Stop it! Whatever you’re doing.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Sure, if you want.” Jacob shrugged. “It’s his own fault if he doesn’t like the things I remember, though.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I glared at him, and he smiled back impishly — like a kid caught doing something he knows he shouldn’tby someone who he knows won’t punish him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“The principal’s on his way to discourage loitering on school property,” Edward murmured to me. “Let’sget to English, Bella, so you’re not involved.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Overprotective, isn’t he?” Jacob said, talking just to me. “A little trouble makes life fun. Let me guess,you’re not allowed to have fun, are you?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward glowered, and his lips pulled back from his teeth ever so slightly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Shut up, Jake,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Jacob laughed. “That sounds like a no. Hey, if you ever feel like having a life again, you could come seeme. I’ve still got your motorcycle in my garage.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　This news distracted me. “You were supposed to sell that. You promised Charlie you would.” If I hadn’tbegged on Jake’s behalf — after all, he’d put weeks of labor into both motorcycles, and he deserved somekind of payback — Charlie would have thrown my bike in a Dumpster. And possibly set that Dumpster onfire.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Yeah, right. Like I would do that. It belongs to you, not me. Anyway, I’ll hold on to it until you want itback.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　A tiny hint of the smile I remembered was suddenly playing around the edges of his lips.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Jake . . .”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He leaned forward, his face earnest now, the bitter sarcasm fading. “I think I might have been wrongbefore, you know, about not being able to be friends. Maybe we could manage it, on my side of the line.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Come see me.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I was vividly conscious of Edward, his arms still wrapped protectively around me, motionless as a stone. Ishot a look at his face — it was calm, patient.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I, er, don’t know about that, Jake.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Jacob dropped the antagonistic faade completely. It was like he’d forgotten Edward was there, or atleast he was determined to act that way. “I miss you every day, Bella. It’s not the same without you.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I know and I’m sorry, Jake, I just . . .”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He shook his head, and sighed. “I know. Doesn’t matter, right? I guess I’ll survive or something. Whoneeds friends?” He grimaced, trying to cover the pain with a thin attempt at bravado.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Jacob’s suffering had always triggered my protective side. It was not entirely rational — Jacob was hardlyin need of any physical protection I could offer. But my arms, pinned beneath Edward’s, yearned to reach outto him. To wrap around his big, warm waist in a silent promise of acceptance and comfort.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward’s shielding arms had become restraints.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Okay, get to class,” a stern voice sounded behind us. “Move along, Mr. Crowley.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Get to school, Jake,” I whispered, anxious as soon as I recognized the principal’s voice. Jacob went tothe Quileute school, but he might still get in trouble for trespassing or the equivalent.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward released me, taking just my hand and pulling me behind his body again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Mr. Greene pushed through the circle of spectators, his brows pressing down like ominous storm cloudsover his small eyes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I mean it,” he was threatening. “Detention for anyone who’s still standing here when I turn around again.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The audience melted away before he was finished with his sentence.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Ah, Mr. Cullen. Do we have a problem here?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　 “Not at all, Mr. Greene. We were just on our way to class.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Excellent. I don’t seem to recognize your friend.” Mr. Greene turned his glower on Jacob. “Are you anew student here?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Mr. Greene’s eyes scrutinized Jacob, and I could see that he’d come to the same conclusion everyoneelse had: dangerous. A troublemaker.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Nope,” Jacob answered, half a smirk on his broad lips.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Then I suggest you remove yourself from school property at once, young man, before I call the police.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Jacob’s little smirk became a full-blown grin, and I knew he was picturing Charlie showing up to arresthim. This grin was too bitter, too full of mocking to satisfy me. This wasn’t the smile I’d been waiting to see.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Jacob said, “Yes, sir,” and snapped a military salute before he climbed on his bike and kicked it to a startright there on the sidewalk. The engine snarled and then the tires squealed as he spun it sharply around. In amatter of seconds, Jacob raced out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Mr. Greene gnashed his teeth together while he watched the performance.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Mr. Cullen, I expect you to ask your friend to refrain from trespassing again.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“He’s no friend of mine, Mr. Greene, but I’ll pass along the warning.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Mr. Greene pursed his lips. Edward’s perfect grades and spotless record were clearly a factor in Mr.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Greene’s assessment of the incident. “I see. If you’re worried about any trouble, I’d be happy to —”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“There’s nothing to worry about, Mr. Greene. There won’t be any trouble.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I hope that’s correct. Well, then. On to class. You, too, Miss Swan.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward nodded, and pulled me quickly along toward the English building.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Do you feel well enough to go to class?” he whispered when we were past the principal.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Yes,” I whispered back, not quite sure if this was a lie.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Whether I felt well or not was hardly the most important consideration. I needed to talk to Edward rightaway, and English class wasn’t the ideal place for the conversation I had in mind.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　But with Mr. Greene right behind us, there weren’t a lot of other options.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　We got to class a little late and took our seats quickly. Mr. Berty was reciting a Frost poem. He ignoredour entrance, refusing to let us break his rhythm.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I yanked a blank page out of my notebook and started writing, my handwriting more illegible than normalthanks to my agitation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　What happened? Tell me everything. And screw the protecting me crap, please.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I shoved the note at Edward. He sighed, and then began writing. It took him less time than me, though hewrote an entire paragraph in his own personal calligraphy before he slipped the paper back.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Alice saw that Victoria was coming back. I took you out of town merely as a precaution — therewas never a chance that she would have gotten anywhere close to you. Emmett and Jasper verynearly had her, but Victoria seems to have some instinct for evasion. She escaped right down theQuileute boundary line as if she were reading it from a map. It didn’t help that Alice’s abilities werenullified by the Quileutes’ involvement. To be fair, the Quileutes might have had her, too, if wehadn’t gotten in the way. The big gray one thought Emmett was over the line, and he got defensive.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Of course Rosalie reacted to that, and everyone left the chase to protect their companions. Carlisleand Jasper got things calmed down before it got out of hand. But by then, Victoria had slippedaway. That’s everything.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I frowned at the letters on the page. All of them had been in on it — Emmett, Jasper, Alice, Rosalie, andCarlisle. Maybe even Esme, though he hadn’t mentioned her. And then Paul and the rest of the Quileute pack.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　It might so easily have turned into a fight, pitting my future family and my old friends against each other. Anyone of them could have been hurt. I imagined the wolves would be in the most danger, but picturing tiny Alicenext to one of the huge werewolves, fighting . . .\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Carefully, I scrubbed out the entire paragraph with my eraser and then I wrote over the top:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　 What about Charlie? She could have been after him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward was shaking his head before I finished, obviously going to downplay any danger on Charlie’sbehalf. He held a hand out, but I ignored that and started again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　You can’t know that she wasn’t thinking that, because you weren’t here. Florida was a bad idea.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He took the paper from underneath my hand.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I wasn’t about to send you off alone. With your luck, not even the black box would survive.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　That wasn’t what I’d meant at all; I hadn’t thought of going without him. I’d meant that we should havestayed here together. But I was sidetracked by his response, and a little miffed. Like I couldn’t fly crosscountry without bringing the plane down. Very funny.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　So let’s say my bad luck did crash the plane. What exactly were you going to do about it?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Why is the plane crashing?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He was trying to hide a smile now.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The pilots are passed out drunk.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Easy. I’d fly the plane.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Of course. I pursed my lips and tried again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Both engines have exploded and we’re falling in a death spiral toward the earth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I’d wait till we were close enough to the ground, get a good grip on you, kick out the wall, andjump. Then I’d run you back to the scene of the accident, and we’d stumble around like the twoluckiest survivors in history.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I stared at him wordlessly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“What?” he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I shook my head in awe. “Nothing,” I mouthed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I scrubbed out the disconcerting conversation and wrote one more line.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　You will tell me next time.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I knew there would be a next time. The pattern would continue until someone lost.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward stared into my eyes for a long moment. I wondered what my face looked like — it felt cold, sothe blood hadn’t returned to my cheeks. My eyelashes were still wet.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He sighed and then nodded once.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Thanks.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The paper disappeared from under my hand. I looked up, blinkingin surprise, just as Mr. Berty camedown the aisle.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Is that something you’d like to share there, Mr. Cullen?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Edward looked up innocently and held out the sheet of paper on top of his folder. “My notes?” he asked,sounding confused.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　 Mr. Berty scanned the notes — no doubt a perfect transcription of his lecture — and then walked awayfrowning.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　It was later, in Calculus — my one class without Edward — that I heard the gossip.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“My money’s on the big Indian,” someone was saying.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I peeked up to see that Tyler, Mike, Austin, and Ben had their heads bent together, deep in conversation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Yeah,” Mike whispered. “Did you see the size of that Jacob kid? I think he could take Cullen down.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Mike sounded pleased by the idea.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I don’t think so,” Ben disagreed. “There’s something about Edward. He’s always so . . . confident. Ihave a feeling he can take care of himself.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I’m with Ben,” Tyler agreed. “Besides, if that other kid messed Edward up, you know those big brothersof his would get involved.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Have you been down to La Push lately?” Mike asked. “Lauren and I went to the beach a couple ofweeks ago, and believe me, Jacob’s friends are all just as big as he is.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Huh,” Tyler said. “Too bad it didn’t turn into anything. Guess we’ll never know how it would have turnedout.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“It didn’t look over to me,” Austin said. “Maybe we’ll get to see.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Mike grinned. “Anyone in the mood for a bet?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Ten on Jacob,” Austin said at once.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Ten on Cullen,” Tyler chimed in.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Ten on Edward,” Ben agreed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Jacob,” Mike said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“Hey, do you guys know what it was about?” Austin wondered. “That might affect the odds.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I can guess,” Mike said, and then he shot a glance at me at the same time that Ben and Tyler did.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　From their expressions, none of them had realized I was in easy hearing distance. They all looked awayquickly, shuffling the papers on their desks.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　“I still say Jacob,” Mike muttered under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/148/5946.html","bookId":330,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 6:02:49 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 6:02:49 AM"}
