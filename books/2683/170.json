And there was the hooded parka.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was the tattoo, black and shapeless, on her right shoulder blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis tattoo did not exist the afternoon we first met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou never saw Marina\u0027s face that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to go to London,\" a voice whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night, you never touched her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou understand that something incomplete is being revealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn unscheduled stop mid-crossing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone climbs aboard a ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA girl you didn\u0027t save was doomed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s all very clear but you have to keep guessing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s what you don\u0027t know that matters most.

He\u0027s looking down at me. He\u0027s holding a finger to his lips. He\u0027s saying \"Shhh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e26\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause metro service doesn\u0027t begin until 5:30 I\u0027m walking aimlessly through a dark early-morning fog, staggering for long stretches, until automatic timers turn the streetlights off and clubs are just closing and a figure, a specter, strolling by smiles venomously at me and in the fog the outlines of glass and concrete towers keep shifting shapes and without thinking about direction I find myself walking toward the Eiffel Tower, through the Parc du Champ de Mars and then across the Seine on the Pont d\u0027Iena and then past the Palais de Chaillot. A pigeon bursts out of the fog, leaving a swirling trail behind. Without warning, leaning against a black Citroen, in the fog, is the Christian Bale look-alike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor?\" he asks, rock-faced, subdued. He\u0027s wearing a black cardigan, ankle boots, a Prada overcoat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilently I walk up to him, the streets littered with confetti, the fog locking in on us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone wants to see you,\" he says simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just nod and without any prodding get into the back of the Citroen, lying flat across the seat, then curling up once the car starts moving, and I\u0027m making noises in the backseat, sometimes weeping. He tells me not to crack up. He remarks delicately about an opening in my destiny. But I\u0027m paying minimal attention, listening to him as closely as I would listen to a brick, a tree, a pile of sand. Finally, absurdly, I ask, \"Do you know who I am?\" On the radio: something emblematic of where I\u0027m at in this moment, something like \"Don\u0027t Fear the Reaper\" or \"I\u0027m a Believer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hotel on Avenue Kleber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the Christian Bale guy down a hallway lined with photos of mostly dead celebrities, I\u0027m so drowsy I can barely keep up with him and the lights above us keep flickering chicly and at the far end we arrive at a door covered with a thin sheet of frost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the room all the lights are dimmed, and sitting at a desk, Sky TV glowing soundlessly on a large-screen television behind him, legs primly crossed, smoking a cigarette, is F. Fred Palakon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI appear seemingly nonplussed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Victor,\" Palakon says. \"How are things?\" he asks menacingly. \"Remember me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Christian Bale guy closes the door behind us, then locks it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalakon gestures toward the edge of the bed. After I sit down, facing him, he recrosses his legs, regarding me unfavorably. It\u0027s freezing in the hotel room and I rub my hands together to keep them warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got... lost,\" is all I say, shamefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, not really,\" Palakon says. \"Not what you\u0027d technically call \u0027lost,\u0027 but I suppose there\u0027s some truth in your statement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m staring at the carpet, at the patterns revealing themselves in the carpet, and I keep rubbing my hands together to keep them warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see you\u0027ve taken up with quite a crowd,\" Palakon says. \"I shouldn\u0027t be surprised.
