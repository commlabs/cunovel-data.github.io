This was a comprehensive cultivation method, not just a single move.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt included the countless Laws of the Divine Realm, including the five elemental Laws, the Life Laws, Yin Yang Laws, and so forth.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut, the main focus of the Divine Seal Art was the Space Laws and Time Laws.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThese two Laws were the Laws that Empyrean Divine Seal was most skilled in.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen Lin Ming had discovered the Ancient Elysium Seal deep beneath Immemorial Imperial City, he found that Empyrean Divine Seal had used the Ancient Elysium Seal as an array eye to suppress an unknown existence. The sealing technique he used was recorded within the Divine Seal Art.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming found it hard to imagine just what type of existence was suppressed by Empyrean Divine Seal’s Divine Seal Art for 3.6 billion years and still hadn’t died.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEven though Lin Ming had now inherited a tiny incomplete soul fragment of Empyrean Divine Seal, he still didn’t have any memories of this.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLike this, Lin Ming was lost in a deep sleep, constantly experiencing the memories left behind by Empyrean Divine Seal.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd on the arena stage, the battles were carrying on.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn Xiao Moxian and Frost Dream’s match, Frost Dream had defeated Xiao Moxian without any problems. At this point, only Frost Dream and Hang Chi still had unbroken winning streaks.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe third match of the second round was Jun Bluemoon against Dragon Fang.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMany people were looking forwards to this battle. Although the two of them had lost to Lin Ming, the disparity wasn’t too great, especially with Jun Bluemoon, who had withstood Lin Ming’s Heavenly Dao Judgment without suffering any injuries.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs soon as Jun Bluemoon stepped on stage he used his Yin Yang Laws.

Even Jun Bluemoon’s finishing move, the 64 Yin Yang Trigrams Sword was seen through by Dragon Fang’s All Existence to Void.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, Jun Bluemoon was extremely tough.

They slowly began to reach their limits, but in the end, Jun Bluemoon’s endurance proved to be superior. With a small advantage, Jun Bluemoon took the lead and won a hard-earned victory against Dragon Fang.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis difficult victory showed that the two youths were individually matched. Who won or who lost, luck and their current condition played an extremely large role.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThus, the second round in the first group of six people ended like this. Even so, Lin Ming still hadn’t woken up.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eVast Cosmos announced the beginning of the third round.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis round should have been where Lin Ming and Frost Dream battled, but because Lin Ming had fallen into a deep sleep, Frost Dream drew a bye. This left behind Hang Chi, Dragon Fang, Xiao Moxian, and Jun Bluemoon still competing. In truth, among these four people, most of them had already fought, thus there weren’t many matches left.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe two matches for this round were Hang Chi against Jun Bluemoon and Dragon Fang against Xiao Moxian.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eCompared to the last matches, these were much less anticipated.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Frost Dream hasn’t gone on stage… I wanted to watch Frost Dream fight Lin Ming!” Some audience members knew that Frost Dream had drawn a bye and were somewhat dissatisfied.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFrost Dream was the dream lover of many heroic young elites. They all wanted to see Frost Dream in action. Even if there wasn’t any suspense in the match between Frost Dream and Lin Ming, they still wished to see her roll over her opponents with absolute strength.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt could only be said that Frost Dream was too popular.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eCompared to Frost Dream and Xiao Moxian, Lin Ming simply didn’t have much support.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It doesn’t matter if Frost Dream fights Lin Ming or not; it’s just a small interlude, Frost Dream will win no matter what. The only one who can truly compete with Frost Dream here is Hang Chi. But, I think that Hang Chi has higher chances of losing. Just look at when Frost Dream fought Dragon Fang. She defeated him without much effort.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Speaking about it… what’s going on with Lin Ming? Are his injuries really that heavy? An Empyrean Heavenly Palace shouldn’t be lacking in medicines, right? With all sorts of wonderful medicines at his use, he still didn’t immediately recover?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It must be a soul injury. Hang Chi is a kind and merciful person so he should know what his limits are. However, Lin Ming wanted to show off his strength, and even though he knew he wasn’t Hang Chi’s match, he still used that World King level Minor Samsara Path to struggle with Hang Chi’s transcendent divine might, the Wheel of Samsara. How could a World King level cultivation method possibly triumph over a transcendent divine might? There is a gap in cultivation methods and also a gap in cultivation realms; the result of the match was already decided from the beginning. Even so, Lin Ming wanted to fight and the aura he displayed was so powerful that it made others feel he wasn’t much weaker at all. Finally, all of that caused him to be injured too heavily. This is just a martial arts contest but he was so reckless…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAn old man shook his head, his voice filled with regret. A soul injury was not easy to cure. If a martial artist’s soul was injured, that was definitely bad news.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLuckily, this had happened in Vast Universe Heavenly Palace. There were many precious soul recovery medicines here so Lin Ming should be in a much better position.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut even so, in this case, if Lin Ming still remained unconscious and missed the third round of matches and allowed Frost Dream to draw a bye, this would be proof that his injuries were extremely heavy!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis sort of wound was likely to leave permanent damage behind!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTo a genius, this was undoubtedly a tremendous loss! It might even affect his future achievements.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“If he really is heavily injured then Lin Ming’s losses will be great. Isn’t Vast Cosmos the referee? How come he didn’t stop the match?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“How could it be so easy? All of these geniuses are difficult to measure with common sense. Even for a half-step Empyrean, it’s impossible for them to determine who is weaker or stronger before they fight. There are bound to be unexpected surprises. This time Lin Ming truly didn’t consider the situation. These young ones are far too spirited.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming was unconscious, news of his situation spread through the arena. As people heard this, they began to think that Lin Ming had tried too hard to show off in front of Hang Chi, and had suffered a soul wound because of it. Not even Vast Cosmos was able to cure him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was the heart of human jealousy, something everyone possessed. As the audience saw Lin Ming suffer, some of them were sorry for him but some were also gloating at his suffering. For instance, the Skydark Holy Lands’ Nether Limitless was extremely happy to hear this. The deeper Lin Ming’s wounds were, the better it was.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, deep within Vast Universe Heavenly Palace, Empyrean Vast Universe said to Empyrean Divine Dream, “What is wrong with Lin Ming? I don’t feel as if his soul has been injured, so why hasn’t he awoken after such a long time?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLet alone Empyrean Vast Universe, not even Empyrean Divine Dream was able to see through the divine soul mark that Empyrean Divine Seal left behind.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEmpyrean Divine Dream shook her head, saying, “It’s hard to say. Perhaps it might have something to do with the time he climbed up the Divine Seal Altar’s 33\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003erd\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e step.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“If he continues to stay asleep then the tournament will end. He still has a match left with Frost Dream. Do you plan on sentencing Lin Ming to a loss?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAlthough Empyrean Vast Universe didn’t think that Lin Ming had a chance of winning, it was still too careless to so easily decide someone’s defeat.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eDivine Dream said, “Have Lin Ming placed into a time enchantment… a 1:100 time flow. He should be able to wake up. Characters like him will not fall from the altar so easily and he still has a long road awaiting him. He will surely pass this trial.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Divine Dream spoke, Empyrean Vast Universe could only concur. He sent an order to Xin Shenzi to have Lin Ming placed into a 1:100 time flow enchantment.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eXin Shenzi himself was a Great World King master so it was easy for him to lay down such an enchantment. After he set down Lin Ming in a good position, he reached out and waved his hands. Four jade bunnies leapt out from his spirit beast chart, transforming into four beautiful young girls within the enchantment.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThese four young girls all originated from the monster race and their cultivations were equal to a late Revolving Core realm human’s. They were only a single step away from making a breakthrough. The jade bunny clan of the monster race had a naturally docile and gentle temperament. They had fallen into dire straits and were rescued by Xin Shenzi. At the time, Xin Shenzi just happened to have a spirit beast chart magic tool, so he accepted them as his secret disciples.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The four of you will be responsible for looking after Lin Ming. Do not allow the slightest error to occur. Until he wakes up, immediately report to me any changes that occur.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFollowing that, within the time enchantment, the four Revolving Core young girls of the monster race spent every second of the day watching and caring for Lin Ming. Their actions were orderly and meticulous.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, when these four young girls entered the enchantment to care for Lin Ming, they never imagined it would be for such a long time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSoon, half a year passed and Lin Ming still remained asleep as before!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFor such a long time, these four young girls constantly stared at the face of a single young man and their lives were naturally boring. Luckily, Lin Ming had an extraordinarily handsome face with an excellent and dashing temperament. Looking at him all day was a comfortable experience.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis continued to eight months, nine months…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming still didn’t wake up.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf an ordinary person slept for such a long time, their body would have become smelly and covered with sores. However, Lin Ming remained clean and free of dust the entire time. He exuded a hint of masculinity that was pleasant to smell. Thus, these four young girls didn’t have to do something so embarrassing like wiping down his body or helping him bathe.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSlowly, one year passed…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eDuring this year, Lin Ming constantly comprehended within the samsara world. Immersed in a sea of Laws, he forgot time, and forgot all else.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe even forgot the memory that he had been struck by the Wheel of Samsara and was experiencing a long dream. Rather, he thought that this was his life, that this was reality.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEvery day was spent in non-stop pondering and meditation. Sometimes Lin Ming was like a rock, sitting still for an entire month. Within this dream, his body was surrounded with countless dao patterns and Law fragments, These dao patterns ran over him like trickling water before flowing into his body and then slowly leaking out from his pores. Everything seemed harmonious, like a perfect cycle.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhat sort of character was Empyrean Divine Seal? The runes he left behind contained not only comprehensions of Laws but also fragments of memories. How could this be comprehended in several days or even several months?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEven with Lin Ming’s perception, wanting to thoroughly comprehend these things and reform the Divine Seal Art was extremely difficult!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn a year of time, Lin Ming had comprehended only a tenth of the Laws that Empyrean Divine Seal had left behind. He had just barely managed to cross into the threshold of the Divine Seal Art.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBeyond that, there were also many Laws. However, Lin Ming wasn’t able to comprehend them because his boundary was simply far too shallow.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEmpyrean Divine Seal’s boundary was just far too high. Just this tiny insignificant soul fragment was enough for Lin Ming to enjoy for a hundred years, allowing him to meditate on it for two or three large boundaries.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe truth was that this was something that only Lin Ming could do. If someone else were here, then even if they were a top extreme character like Hang Chi or Jun Bluemoon, they would still be powerless when facing Empyrean Divine Seal’s Laws.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was because they had yet to comprehend the Concept of the 33 Layered Heavens. It was also because of this point that Lin Ming was able to obtain Empyrean Divine Seal’s inheritance.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-1315\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-1317\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-1316","bookId":1508,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:41:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:41:20 AM"}
