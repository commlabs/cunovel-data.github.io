Even though it was only part-time, it distracted her from her troubles for at least a few hours a day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father had tried to help Anson. Allison appreciated the way he’d stepped in and stood at Anson’s side after that fire in the park. Her father had been the only one, too. Anson’s own mother had turned her back on him; Cherry Butler had as much as said that her son deserved whatever he got. Nor did she seem terribly concerned that Anson had now disappeared. According to Cherry, he’d come back when he was ready, and until then, she wasn’t wasting any time worrying about him. Allison was horrified by his mother’s attitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Allison had run away, she knew her parents would never stop looking for her. And they wouldn’t ever give up on her, like Anson’s mother had on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, that was what Anson had said the night he left—that Allison was lucky. She had parents who loved her and cared about her. Anson claimed no one gave a damn about him. He was wrong. Allison cared. Her parents, too, were concerned about him, although of course their primary goal was to protect Allison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome kids were born lucky, Anson had told her, and she was one of them. He wasn’t. He insisted that he had to make his own luck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she opened the front door of Smith, Cox and Jefferson, Allison noticed that the reception area was full of clients who’d waited until the last minute to file their taxes. With only four days to go until April fifteenth, she sensed the uneasiness in the room. It was like this every year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary Lou, the receptionist, returned Allison’s smile. “There’s someone to see you in the kitchen,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a fleeting moment Allison thought it might be Anson. It couldn’t be, though. The minute he showed up, the sheriff’s office would become involved. Her father would be duty-bound to call them. Because Sheriff Davis suspected Anson would try to contact her at some point, her parents had discussed the possibility and the action they’d have to take. The matter was out of her hands and her father’s, too. Allison had no choice but to accept that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who is it?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother smile appeared on the receptionist’s face. “You’ll just have to check it out for yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison was puzzled, since it wasn’t like Mary Lou to be so mysterious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kitchen, located behind the office, wasn’t a real kitchen—more of a lunchroom, with a microwave and a small refrigerator, plus a table and four chairs. Most days, Allison stuck her schoolbooks and purse in a cupboard there. As she walked into the room, she saw a baby carrier—complete with baby—resting on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cecilia!” she cried, delighted beyond words. Her father’s assistant had been a good friend to Allison, a better friend than either of her parents would ever know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree years earlier, Zach and Rosie Cox had divorced. It had been a terrible time for their family, especially Allison. She’d rebelled, hanging out with the wrong crowd. Her grades had slipped drastically and she’d stopped caring about much of anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her father offered her a part-time job, she wasn’t fooled. She’d been well aware that the only reason he was willing to hire her was to keep an eye on her after school. She’d taken the job, but she’d gone into it with a bad attitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she discovered she wouldn’t be working for her dad. He’d assigned her to assist Cecilia Randall, and the young navy wife had helped Allison understand her own behavior—what she was doing and why. Cecilia’s parents had divorced when she was ten and she understood the pain Allison was feeling. Cecilia had guided her out of the self-destructive rut into which she’d stumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Cecilia saw Allison now, she opened her arms wide for a hug. “I decided Aaron could do with a day out in the sunshine,” her friend said, wrapping her arms around Allison and pulling her close. The baby was only three weeks old, so Cecilia hadn’t been out of the office long. It felt like an eternity, though, because so much had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClasping Allison’s shoulders, Cecilia leaned back and studied her. “You look…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dreadful,” Allison muttered. With everyone else, including her parents, she could pretend, but not with Cecilia. She wasn’t sleeping nights, and she’d grown so weary of carrying this burden of worry and fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anson,” Cecilia whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe baby began to cry, demanding attention. He was loosely covered with the blanket Allison had knit. At first glance she thought Aaron resembled Cecilia’s husband, Ian, but as she studied the baby, Allison saw plenty of his mother in him, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Cecilia, he’s adorable,” she whispered, giving Aaron her finger to hold. The infant immediately clutched it with one tiny hand, and she was surprised by the strength of his grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s already spoiled,” Cecilia said, smiling fondly down on her son. “It’s bad enough that I’m at his beck and call, but you should see Ian. You’d think the sun rose and set on this baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause Cecilia and Ian’s first baby had died shortly after her birth, Allison knew how precious this child was to her friend. Aaron started to fuss again, more loudly this time. Cecilia lifted him out of the carrier and sat down at the table. “I think I’d better nurse him for a few minutes,” she said, draping the blanket over her shoulder while she unfastened her blouse and expertly arranged her son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sit,” she ordered Allison, gesturing with her head at the chair beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison willingly complied. “I’ve wanted to talk to you so badly,” she said. Thankfully, no one had come in search of her. Busy though the staff was, they seemed to know that Allison needed this time with Cecilia, just the two of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can call me whenever you need to,” Cecilia assured her. “I worried about you when I didn’t hear anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I couldn’t—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know,” Cecilia said as she nursed her infant son. Her gaze was focused on Aaron. With her free hand, she stroked the wisps of hair at his temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you remember that when we first met, I was going out with Ryan Wilson?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The kid with the paper-clip earring?” Cecilia asked, grinning down at her son as if to suggest she dreaded the day he’d become a teenager. “I believe your father might’ve have mentioned him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison felt embarrassed now to recall how foolish she’d been. Ryan was trouble, and getting involved with him had been a blatant attempt to pay her parents back for their selfishness—what she saw now as their temporary insanity. Soon after that, her parents had reconciled, and before the summer was out they’d remarried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anson isn’t anything like Ryan.” She shook her head. “People might think he is, but Anson’s a much better person. He’s smart and loyal and kind. Ryan isn’t any of those things. He isn’t even in school anymore. I have no idea where he is.” But she had no idea where Anson was, either….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know that,” Cecilia said calmly, “and the reason I do is your father. He would never have gone out of his way to help if he thought Anson would hurt you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He has hurt me,” Allison protested, clenching her fists. “I don’t understand why he ran away.” She wondered if Anson considered what a terrible position he’d put her in. She realized that he didn’t have the luxury of thinking about anyone but himself. He had to escape, had to run. However, he’d left Allison to face his detractors, alone, and she was afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sometimes people don’t know how to deal with pain,” Cecilia said, her gaze still on her baby. “The only way they can react is by running.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That only makes things worse,” Allison said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re wise to recognize that,” Cecilia told her. “But unfortunately, Anson hasn’t figured it out. My guess is he’s hurt and confused, and taking off was kind of a knee-jerk reaction to pain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where would he go?” As far as she knew, Anson didn’t have any family. His mother was a sorry excuse for a parent, and he’d never known his father. Not once had Anson mentioned grandparents or uncles or aunts. She’d racked her brain, trying to work out where he could possibly find a hiding place. She hoped he was safe and had enough to eat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom and Dad said the minute he contacts me I need to call Sheriff Davis.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And they’re right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison agreed, although she didn’t like it. “Anson is what the sheriff called a person of interest.” She was interested, too, darn it. She had questions of her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Aaron was finished, Cecilia buttoned her blouse and placed the baby over her shoulder, rubbing his back. “Everything’s going to work out, Allison. If Anson is innocent—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He is,” she said vehemently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCecilia raised her head abruptly, staring at Allison. Her dark eyes seemed to burn straight through her. “There’s something you’re not telling me, isn’t there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison swallowed convulsively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can see from the look in your eyes.” Cecilia paused, waiting. “Allison? Have you heard from him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Allison?” she asked again, her voice calm. “You’d better tell me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…I’m not sure….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are you afraid?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLowering her head, Allison bit her lip. “No one else knows,” she murmured. Last week, when the sheriff had come to speak to her, she’d answered all his questions—to the letter. But he hadn’t asked about this particular thing, and Allison hadn’t volunteered the information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can trust me,” Cecilia added. “You know I want only the best for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison nodded. “You won’t tell anyone?” She tried to keep the pleading out of her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you ask me not to say anything, I won’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not to anyone,” she insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.” Allison took a deep breath. “If I tell you…you might think—you might believe Anson set the fire.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not withholding evidence, are you?” Cecilia asked urgently. “Because that would change everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No! I couldn’t do that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCecilia sighed with relief. “Good, because that would make you an accessory.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheriff Davis and her parents had already explained this. “I answered all his questions truthfully,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCecilia frowned. “This was a sin of omission, then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison slowly released her breath. “That night…when Anson knocked on my bedroom window.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced up and Cecilia nodded, encouraging her to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We talked, and…and then he came into my room.” Her mother had been really upset when Allison admitted that; she could only imagine what Rosie would say if she knew the rest. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/6-rainier-drive-cedar-cove-6/page-3.html","bookId":1947,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:06:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:06:35 AM"}
