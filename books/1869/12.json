{"id":82633,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"\u003cp\u003eThere are at least twenty YouTube videos of Lucas\u0027s performance circulating the Internet by time I wake up at 7am on the dot the next morning. There are already - and I shit you not - death threats about the \"red-headed cunt\" Lucas was serenading on one of the Your Toxic Sequel fan sites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I find out about all of this because Tori sends me links, messages, and enough texts to make me want to turn off my phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I just suck it up and answer. It\u0027s 5:30am in California. \"There are pictures of you with Lucas Wolfe online,\" she says in a monotone voice. \"Why are there pictures of you with Lucas Wolfe on the Internet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I-I . . .\" I\u0027m stuttering ridiculously, staring down in horror at my computer screen at the video of Lucas performing, and wondering who else has seen these videos. You know, besides every rabid Lucas Wolfe fan. For once I feel fortunate that Tomas, my boss, is such a media snob and refuses to read gossip magazines. I don\u0027t need this getting back to him - not when I\u0027m supposed to be here in Nashville to take care of my Gram. Not when -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel a sinking feeling in my chest, and I ball my hand into a fist, massaging it over my heart. What if my grandmother sees this? It would literally break her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sienna, talk to me,\" Tori says pleadingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I . . . I work for him,\" I admit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just as I expect, she starts freaking out. She starts doing the exact thing that made me avoid telling her about my deal with Lucas in the first place. \"Since when? Why? Sienna . . . he\u0027s trying to take your grandmother\u0027s goddamn house away. How could you work for him? Why would you work for hi - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the love of God, shut up for just one second so I can think,\" I snap. I hear a sharp gasp for air on the other end, and I immediately feel horrible for barking at her. In all the time that I\u0027ve known Tori, I\u0027ve never once raised my voice at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve never spoke to anyone like that besides Lucas Wolfe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tori . . . I\u0027m sorry,\" I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sounds dazed when she speaks. \"I\u0027m actually hovering somewhere between really fucking irritated you told me to shut up and being impressed. Sienna, what\u0027s really going on? Please . . . I\u0027m your best friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cry as I tell her. I leave nothing out except for Lucas\u0027s sexual habits, and when I\u0027m done all she\u0027s able to say is \"Wow\" over and over and over again until I tell her that she\u0027s giving me a headache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got to be the most . . . selfless and ridiculously awesome person I know. To be doing something like that with someone like him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t like the way her tone implies that he\u0027s a bad person. Hell, I don\u0027t like the way I\u0027m so willing to jump to his defense, but I do it anyway. \"He\u0027s not all bad,\" I say, my voice sounding totally convincing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. My. God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThinking that there\u0027s been a new article put out about me and Lucas, I frantically refresh Google news search I have open on my screen. \"What? What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re in love with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second those words come out of her mouth, sounding like an accusation and a curse and a crime all at once, I wish she had said there was a new set of rumors instead. I\u0027m not in love with Lucas. Completely in lust, yes, but not in love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever in love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s ridiculous I don\u0027t know him well enough to love him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then, he\u0027s got to have the most - \" Tori\u0027s words are cut off mid-sentence by the sound of my cell phone beeping. I pull it from my ear and my heart launches into my throat, gagging me, when I see that it\u0027s Seth. God, this can\u0027t be a good thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI promise Tori that I\u0027ll call her back and she warns me that she\u0027ll fly to Nashville tonight, spending our rent money and leaving us homeless, if I don\u0027t. When I click over to Seth, he\u0027s already cursing. Seething.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You lied to Gram so you could go fuck the douchebag who bought her house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seth, I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he doesn\u0027t want to let me get a word in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re disgusting. Guess you\u0027re more like her than you let on, huh? Don\u0027t worry . . . what you\u0027re doing won\u0027t ever be big enough news to reach Gram and I sure as hell won\u0027t tell her. Maybe if you\u0027re lucky he\u0027ll - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heartbeat picks up wildly when Lucas plucks my phone out of my hand and jabs the END button. \"You\u0027re going to sit there and let him talk to you like that?\" he demands. \"That\u0027s your brother, right? The skinny little prick with the big mouth from court?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never realized Seth had ever said anything to Lucas, and I glance down at my lap, at my hands. \"He was angry,\" I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s no excuse for him treating you like shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re all over the Internet,\" I say. \"You and I are everywhere because of last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though he shrugs, I can tell it gets to him, too. That he regrets having ever looking at me while he sang. \"It\u0027s not a big deal. And stop changing the subject. We\u0027re talking about your brother speaking to you like you\u0027re nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll - \" I want to say that Seth will get over it, but I don\u0027t even know how to defend him to someone like Lucas. My brother hadn\u0027t even said very much to me but somehow managed to take a pair of scissors to my self-esteem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucas kneels down in front of me, on his knees, and places his forearms on either side of my body so that they\u0027re almost brushing my hips. He bends his head toward my lap and a primal ache stretches across my belly. \"Call him back and stand up for yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, my long hair sweeping back and forth over his face when he looks up at me. \"No,\" I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrow. \"You\u0027re going to have to one of these days. Stand up to your brother and your mom. You don\u0027t have to take shit from people. You don\u0027t have to try and explain yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe climbs to his feet, looking down at me with almost sad hazel eyes. \"Today\u0027s the first day of filming for the documentary and I\u0027ve got some studio work that needs to be done. Take the day off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bu - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take the day off,\" he orders. \"I can\u0027t - you can\u0027t expect me to be able to be around you like this when I want you so bad. When you\u0027re not willing to let me have you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now - now I think I fully understand why he\u0027s encouraging this. Because Lucas Wolfe thinks that if I take on the things and people that I always back down to, I\u0027ll allow him to conquer me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of a piano awakens me a little after 1am. I had stayed up until a few minutes short of midnight waiting up for Lucas and texting Tori as she hopped from night club to night club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I slide a short cotton robe over my t-shirt, I follow the noise down to the lowest level of the house. Once I hit the bottom step, I let the scent of what Lucas is smoking guide me. I\u0027ve always hated the scent of pot because it reminds me of Preston, of the people who used to hang around my mom\u0027s house, and I automatically wrinkle my nose. Lucas doesn\u0027t look up when I open the door to the piano room, but I know he knows I\u0027m in here because his back straightens and his shoulders tense up. I sag against the doorframe, listening to him, drinking this moment in. He\u0027s shirtless, wearing nothing but a pair of jeans that ride low on hips. Lucas Wolfe is all muscles and tattoos and sexiness, but it\u0027s his music that has a way of getting to me. It strips me down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen devours me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I let it. The only difference is that now, it\u0027s in person and once it\u0027s over I\u0027ll have to face the real Lucas Wolfe and not the poor excuse I keep in my nightstand drawer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucas\u0027s shoulders relax a little as he pushes out the last few chords. He scribbles something into a tattered blue notebook, reading over his notes a few times before he lifts sleepy, hazel eyes to mine. Locks of his messy, dark hair spill into one of them. \"I didn\u0027t call for you,\" he says huskily. \"What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I-I didn\u0027t realize you played,\" I whisper. God, where\u0027s my voice? My nerve? Why the fuck do I come apart when I\u0027m around him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Google is your friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel my body ignite, but when I turn to leave, he says softly, \"Stay. I don\u0027t want to . . .\" And though there\u0027s a part of me that wants to take advantage of the vulnerability in his voice, there\u0027s another part that\u0027s reminding me of my deal with this man. I\u0027m at his beck and call for the next five days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now, he wants me with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTentatively, I walk forward. The tile is cold under my bare feet, and I wish I\u0027d never gotten out of bed. I stand next to the piano and cross my arms over my chest. \"How long do you need me for?\" I demand, glaring down at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s writing in his notebook again - shorthand lyrics from the look of things - but his lips move into a slow grin that makes those uncomfortable flutters start in the pit of my stomach again. Does he realize how much these little gestures screw with my resolve?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course he does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Long as it takes,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting an eyebrow, he tilts his head to one side and studies me for a good minute before starting to play again. It\u0027s the same song from before, but now he\u0027s changed the key, slowed it down. Now it\u0027s haunting and unnerving. He sings along in some spots. The lyrics aren\u0027t whole enough to fully make sense, but paired with his voice, they\u0027re the sexiest I\u0027ve ever heard. He sings about keeping the lights on and fucking right now, and I feel like it\u0027s an invitation meant only for me. All of the sudden, my throat is dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glances up at me when he\u0027s done. \"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flick the tip of my tongue over my lips. His body stiffens. \"The end is wrong,\" I murmur. \"Too happy. It should be\" - I move forward, lean down, and play several chords - \"this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You play?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Google is your friend, Wolfe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stands, slides the bench to the wall and gestures almost sarcastically to the piano. \"Play it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t argue. I\u0027m too tired and too worked up and all I want is to go back upstairs and climb in bed. I stand behind the keyboard and repeat the chords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Again. Slower. And this time, close your eyes, Red.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do what he asks. The moment I smell his cologne, though, I miss a key. \"This is when you tell me to have sex with you then make me run out for Cheetos, right?\" I ask, my voice high-pitched and strained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs. I swear I feel his mouth on my skin, even though he\u0027s not touching me. \"Cheetos suck. And you know what you have to do for me to have sex with you,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGritting my teeth, I slam my palms down on the piano. The keys make a horrible screeching noise. I glance over my shoulder into his hazel eyes. \"Since you don\u0027t need me, can I go to bed, Mr. Wolfe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Abso-fucking-lutely not. Look Si . . . all you\u0027ve got to do is say the words.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what would those be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dips his face down, bringing his mouth so close to mine we\u0027re only a breath away from kissing. From tearing each other down. From the inevitable. \"Take me all the way, Lucas,\" he drawls in his best impersonation of my accent. \"And that\u0027s what you\u0027re going to say the first time we fuck. My name. Just Lucas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the thing is, the last - and only - time I was weak enough to avoid the inevitable with this man, he treated me like shit. I won\u0027t let him do that to me again. \"Fuck you, Lucas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy words don\u0027t faze him. He\u0027s boasting that cocky look that always makes me want to chop him in the throat. Instead - like an idiot - I rise up on my toes and crush my mouth to his. His tongue parts my lips. He still refuses to touch me, so I whisper, \"Please . . . your hands . . . I want your hands touching me from now on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m safe as long as I\u0027m in control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeep telling yourself that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn\u0027t cup my face or touch my hair or anything romantic like that. He roams his hand down my body, over the curve of my hips, until he\u0027s between my legs, his palm pressing against my panties. He draws his mouth away from mine. \"Fuck me, you\u0027re wet,\" he says. \"Say the words.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Turn around, and play. Same as before and don\u0027t stop,\" he orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI expect him to take his hands away from me when I start, but he doesn\u0027t. I\u0027m one chord in when his fingers slide under my panties. Three measures when he pushes one finger inside me. I gasp and he growls in my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t. Fucking. Stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slips another finger inside of my body, and then moves his hand, hard and fast. Back and forth until I swear I\u0027m dying. I whimper. He breathes heavily into my hair, and I curve my bottom toward him. He\u0027s hard. He\u0027s so fucking hard that I\u0027m suddenly grinding against his hand. And the moment his calloused thumb presses on my clit, I come. I slump against the keyboard on my elbows, my ass in the air. I don\u0027t have it in me to play anymore, but I don\u0027t think he could give two shits. He\u0027s staring down at me with his lips pressed into a thin line and all I can think of is how I want them and his tongue on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd my mouth on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lucas, I want yo - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go to bed, Sienna.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarefully, he pulls his fingers out of my body, and I shudder again. Though my flesh feels like it\u0027s scorching, I manage to stand upright. \"No,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s try this the way you\u0027re familiar with then: Get the fuck out. I need to work and like I\u0027ve told you before, you\u0027re fucking horrible for music.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething sharp and prickly twists my chest. He knows exactly what to say to piss me off. I want to tell him he\u0027s the dumbass who came up with this arrangement in the first place, but I choke back the words. All he\u0027ll do is turn it back on me and remind me why I agreed, throw the deed in my face. I keep my face emotionless and my hands clenched by my sides as I say, \"Good night, Mr. Wolfe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I leave the room, I become aware that my panties are still pushed aside. And that as long as I\u0027m around Lucas, he\u0027ll keep consuming me until there\u0027s nothing left. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devoured-devoured-1/page-12.html","bookId":1869,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:50 PM"}
