Like its Puff-the-Libidinous-Dragon protagonist Steve, this novel delightfully runs roughshod over trailer parks, scrip-happy psychiatrists, right-wing moralists and \"nuked-out future movie\" stars with laugh-aloud wit and gentle affection. Pine Cove is a Pacific coast town of 5000Aa third of whom Dr. Valerie Riordan has rendered dependent on antidepressants. When obsessive-compulsive Bess Leander is found hanged from a calico cloth rope, a possible suicide, Val fears she has been overmedicating, and she blackmails fish-fetishist pharmacist Winston Krauss into giving all antidepressant users placebos instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-lust-lizard-of-melancholy-cove.jpg","author":"Christopher Moore","type":"Humorous","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-lust-lizard-of-melancholy-cove.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:17 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:46:43 PM"}
