I ask myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand and go inside, feeling defiant. I get ready for bed, then peek outside. Kendra\u0027s car is still parked out front. Damn. I talk to my mom about my night, then peek outside again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure enough, that sports car is still out front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI toss and turn all night, resisting the urge to look out my window and check whether Kendra is staying the entire night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, I wish Caleb and I didn\u0027t live next door to each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the morning, her car is gone. Caleb is sitting on his porch as I leave to go to the grocery store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" I say curtly when he sees me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" he says back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI head toward my car. \"Have a good night last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep. You?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The best. Robert\u0027s amazing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You trying to make me jealous?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? Are you jealous?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t like his hands on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s my physical therapist,\" I say. \"He just touched my leg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb jumps off his porch and heads my way. \"Regardless, I still didn\u0027t like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t help but ask. \"What really made you come back to Paradise? Was it Kendra?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it was Lenny, my parents, my sister.\" He shrugs. \"You.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we go for a walk?\" I ask, putting my keys back in my purse. Without talking, we fall into step next to each other. Instinctively, we head for Paradise Park. \"I was ready to let you go. I moved on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then I saw you hugging Kendra last night. When I saw her go into your house ... I\u0027ve never felt more possessive in my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t,\" he says. \"She\u0027s marrying Brian in two weeks. They\u0027re engaged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think she still wants to be with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s not gonna happen. Nothing happened last night. We talked. That\u0027s it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stop when we get to the big oak tree. Caleb and I kissed here for the first time. I\u0027ll never forget how lonely and lost I felt until that kiss. It changed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe changed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb looks up at the thick branches and green leaves waving at us from above. \"This is our tree, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You used to climb it until you broke your arm when you fell off it. I watched you from afar back then.\" I give a short laugh. \"I used to always watch you. I liked you for so long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you were popular and smart and cute and weren\u0027t afraid of anything or anyone. When Leah and I made you watch our dance shows, you pretended to be interested. You were selfless. When you took the blame for me breaking your mom\u0027s ceramic owl statue, you were my hero. I loved watching you, even if you didn\u0027t notice me then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what about now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit on the ground with my back resting against the tree. \"I still can\u0027t keep my eyes off of you. God, if my mom knew I was here with you admitting that fact, she\u0027d freak out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to know what I realized last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That you miss having Kendra in your life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" He crouches on the ground, facing me. \"I miss having you in my life. You\u0027re my best friend, Maggie. Call me crazy, but I want you to be my girlfriend-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God, how I dreamed this day would come. But it\u0027s too late, isn\u0027t it? I reach out and cup his beautiful face in my palm. \"Caleb, I\u0027m leaving in two weeks. I\u0027ll be gone for almost a year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. But we\u0027re here now, right?\" He looks determined, as if he knows we can do this. \"Why don\u0027t we test drive being a couple the next two weeks? Let\u0027s not think about what\u0027s gonna happen after that. What do you say, Maggie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHIRTY-ONE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efter I ask Maggie to be my girlfriend, she looks nervous. \"What about your parents, my mom ... and Leah?\" Her eyebrows are furrowed in worry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie and I are nothing like Kendra and Brian. I think my old best friend and my ex-girlfriend make each other weaker. Maggie and I, together, are one strong team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to tell them about us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes go wide. \"Remember how upset they were last time? I can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you can\u0027t, but together we can.\" I lean and kiss her on the lips. \"Don\u0027t be afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I pull away, our eyes meet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the girl I draw strength from. She\u0027s got more power than she thinks, and she taught me the definition of resilience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA slow smile crosses her lips. \"You really think we can do this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I do.\" For the time being, I do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the evening, we decide to meet at the park after dark. Maggie\u0027s still nervous about telling people about us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moonlight glows on her beautiful face as she comes up to me. I sling my arm around her and we walk quietly. \"What happens after I leave for Spain?\" she finally asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer trip does kind of throw a monkey wrench into the girlfriend plan. But can\u0027t we just live for today and not worry about the future? \"I don\u0027t know. I guess we\u0027ll figure it out as we go along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie smacks her sweet lips together and holds her chin high. She looks ready for a challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time in forever, I feel like I can handle being in Paradise. I stroke her shoulder and slowly trail my fingers down her arm until our fingers touch. I love it when I touch her and hear her breathe harder and faster. It\u0027s a total turn-on. It makes me want to see just how much I can please her. \"I wish we were back at the cabin right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too,\" she whispers. \"I\u0027d make out with you all night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckle. \"I got to be honest with you, Mags. I\u0027d try to do a lot more than make out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like just being with Maggie, talking to Maggie, doing stuff with Maggie ... but I also like fooling around with Maggie. It drives me nuts that she doesn\u0027t realize how much sex appeal she\u0027s got.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat brings a shy smile to her face. \"I like what we did at the cabin. It was hard to leave you in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me what you liked. You know, so I know for next time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m too embarrassed.\" I watch as she nibbles her lip, then cocks her head to the side, thinking. She turns to face me. \"Urn ... how about if I show you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis girl never ceases to amaze me. The more comfortable she is in our relationship, the more her feisty spirit comes out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring it on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout hesitation, she leans forward and brings her face right up to mine. Hoping nobody can see us, I grab her butt and back her up against the tree. \"You okay?\" I murmur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmm.\" Her legs instinctively go around me, and I press into her as she moans against my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn, her kisses are hot and sexy. I feel her energy and eagerness as if it\u0027s my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI definitely don\u0027t have to wait long this time for her tongue to come out and play with mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her soft hands reach under my shirt and toy with the waistband of my jeans, it feels so different than it has with any other girl. Sure, I lust after Maggie. But she makes me nervous, because I also love her. I love her for everything she is and wants to be. She challenges me to forgive others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s my best friend. That thought is humbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get a room,\" I hear a voice say from behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn. One day Maggie and I are going to get some alone time even if I have to save up money to take her to Lake Geneva or Rockford for a weekend like my parents used to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give a frustrated moan as I look over at the spawn of Satan, who can only be named Lenny. What I wasn\u0027t expecting was my old cellmate Julio to be standing beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gently release Maggie and stand in front of her. It\u0027s a sorry attempt at protecting her from Lenny\u0027s ridicule, but we\u0027re kind of caught in a compromising position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, what\u0027re you doing here?\" I ask Julio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thought I\u0027d pay you a little visit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI assumed he\u0027d go back to Chicago when he got released, to see his family and hang with old friends. I never really believed he\u0027d come to see me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, man, what is Maggie going to think of Julio? I\u0027m kind of glad it\u0027s dark, so she doesn\u0027t see all his tattoos. His shaved head makes him look like a badass, but his crazy tats are even more intimidating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maggie, this is Julio. We shared a cell when I was in the DOC.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice to meet you,\" Maggie says, holding out her hand and smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulio slaps her hand and shakes it like she\u0027s one of his homegirls. I\u0027m amused that she doesn\u0027t seem fazed in the least. Julio nods at our obvious disheveled appearance. Maggie\u0027s hair is a mess from my fingers running through it, and I think she somehow managed to get my jeans unzipped without me even knowing. \"Sorry to interrupt whatever you two were doin\u0027... or about to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs long as I\u0027ve got an entourage, I might as well lay down the line. \"Next time, if either of you catch me making out with my girlfriend, just pretend we don\u0027t exist and walk away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Girlfriend?\"Lenny asks. \"Since when did that become official?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since just now,\" Maggie says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t imagine you came here just for a visit,\" I tell Julio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulio, as always, looks and acts cool. In his neighborhood, guys are afraid to screw around with guys who have swagger. You play the game and you don\u0027t get messed with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I don\u0027t like taking nothin\u0027 from nobody, but I need a place to stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it was only up to me, no problem. Julio\u0027s not as crazy as he looks, and his being here is a sign he\u0027s breaking away from his gang ties. \"I need to ask my dad. We\u0027ll work something out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walk to my house. The entire time I\u0027m thinking about how I\u0027m going to break the news to my dad that there\u0027s another friend of mine who needs a roof over his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell, I was just getting revved up to break the news that Maggie and I are a couple. Now I have to deal with Julio needing a place to stay. I feel like an intruder or guest in my own house as it is. Bringing a second random guy to stay might cause my dad to freak out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie squeezes my hand. It\u0027s a silent message that everything will be okay. Somehow I believe her. In the end everything will be okay. But hurdles have to be jumped through first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we get to my house, I find my sister watching television in the living room. She looks surprised when all four of us walk in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" she says as she clicks the television off. Her focus immediately goes to Julio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Sup?\" he says, nodding to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leah, this is Julio. Julio, Leah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Dad?\" I ask her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s either watching TV in his room, or sleeping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should have known. \"Be right back,\" I tell everyone, then take the stairs two at a time and knock on my parent\u0027s bedroom door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open the door and find my dad lying on his big kingsized bed watching television. He turns it off when he sees me come into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you have a good time tonight?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think of Maggie and me. I don\u0027t know what the future holds with us, but I feel good about it. I feel the best I\u0027ve ever felt about us, actually. \"Yeah. I had a great time, thanks. Listen, I\u0027ve got to ask you a favor. This guy who I roomed with at juvie stopped by.\" I clear my throat, because I don\u0027t know how to proceed with asking for yet another favor from my dad. \"He needs a place to crash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For how long?\" Dad asks. I can\u0027t read his reaction, so I tread carefully. I\u0027m at his mercy here. It\u0027s his house. Just before I left Paradise he\u0027d said to follow his rules or leave. I left, because I couldn\u0027t pretend to be a perfect son when I clearly wasn\u0027t one. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/return-to-paradise-leaving-paradise-2/page-25.html","bookId":2772,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:17:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:17:05 PM"}
