Angela was on the line, very excited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey! I think I might know what was going on when Goodman Wilson approached that little girl. Sorry—remember what Will told us about Cindy Yates yelling at Goodman Wilson when he approached the little girl?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. What? What happened at church?” Angela asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Goodman Wilson gave a sermon today—asking his people to go and talk to the police if they knew anything! Anyway, I watched a woman leave with two kids so I got her plate number. Jake ran it down for me. And the boy—the teen—goes to school with David Yates and Joshua Abbott. I think the little girl that Goodman Wilson approached was the daughter…and, since Cindy Yates went after him like a tiger, I’m assuming that the family has been keeping their churchgoing activities a secret. I’ve got an address. You want it? I’m still hanging around by the church, but I can go if you want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, no, I’m just leaving the station. I’ll go. Who am I going to see? What’s the family name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Parents, Michael and Alice Newbury. Teenage son—seventeen-year-old son, Michael, Jr. Little girl, Annie, seven. You’ll find them just off Chestnut Street—I’ll text you the exact address.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks, Angela!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, and I just spoke with Jackson and Sam. They’re going to go and see Mr. Sedge’s son. After, we’ll all meet at the wine bar.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, see you soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenna hung up and a few seconds later, her phone buzzed, the address coming through. Checking it twice, she got in her car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she drove, she mulled over just how she was going to approach the family. All thoughts went out of her head when she drove up to park on the curve across the street from the modest home. The Newbury family was in the front yard. The teenage son, still lanky but growing tall, was tossing a football to his little sister while the parents looked on from their porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe father, Michael, saw Jenna and said something to his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked forward as she approached. “Well,” he said quietly. “You found us quickly. Did Goodman Wilson tell you where to come?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice Newbury rose as well and came forward as Jenna answered honestly, “No, sir. My colleague saw your wife. We traced your license plate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael Newbury nodded, looking at his wife. “Just as well. We should have spoken before. I’m not sure what good it will do, but we should have spoken before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kids had stopped tossing the ball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s wrong?” the little girl asked her brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing, Annie, nothing,” Michael, Jr., said to her. “You go play with your dolls for a little bit. We can run around the yard again in a minute. I think that the lady wants to talk to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“May we get you something, miss?” Alice asked. “We don’t drink spirits, but I can get you some hot coffee or cocoa.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine, thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, come to the porch,” Michael said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice looked around, as if afraid their neighbors would see them talking to Jenna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alice, we all need to admit the truth, and Goodman Wilson has taught us that it doesn’t matter what path a man takes to God, he can be a decent man. Our neighbors are good people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled at her husband. Jenna found herself thinking that while their beliefs might be strict, they were together in those beliefs and had a strong bond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s Michael, Jr., you want to talk to. We’d just be hearsay,” Michael told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael, Jr., took a wicker chair across from Jenna on the porch. He glanced at his father. “I can’t really say anything that will help you a lot—I mean that, I really can’t. I would if I could.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please, just let me know what has, clearly, been bothering you. You never know what will help an investigator in a situation like this and what won’t,” Jenna tried to reassure him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man looked at his parents again and then at her. “We don’t lie about our affiliation with the church,” he said. “We just don’t talk about it. We all went to the same schools for years, and we saw quickly that a lot of the kids really liked to tease and torment Malachi, so…well, I just tried to avoid being teased and tormented, you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand,” Jenna said. “So, what do you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know anything, except that David Yates has been the big man on the school ground since we were kids. And Joshua Abbott has been sidekick for years. If David says something, Joshua repeats it. If David wants to do something, Joshua will do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenna nodded. “Yes, I’ve met them together, and I get that impression.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael, Jr., seemed to have gained his own confidence, knowing that his parents were behind him. “David has talked about Malachi for a long time—since the evil eye incident. But it seemed that he got even worse after Mr. Andres was killed. He told everyone that the Smiths had killed Peter Andres because ‘that old freak hated Andres.’ And he said that Malachi secretly hated him, too. And, well, everyone is kind of afraid of David Yates, so they all believe what he says. Anyway, then David and Joshua both said that they saw Malachi coming out of Mr. Covington’s house the day that he was killed, and I know the police talked to him and his folks, but the grocer—Mr. Sedge—said that he’d swear before God and the angels and all the saints that he knew damned well that Malachi hadn’t done it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, we know that,” Jenna said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again, Michael, Jr., appeared uncomfortable, and he looked over at his parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Michael?” Jenna said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, Mr. Sedge was already saying it, so…well, I was in the grocery that day, too. And I saw Malachi in there. I can’t swear how long he was there, but I know that I saw him talking to Mr. Sedge, and I talked to him myself. He’d left the church, but we all understood why, and we just kind of hoped that he’d return….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had another witness! But the witness they’d once had was dead!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s the way of our church, Miss Duffy,” Michael, Sr., said. “We don’t condemn those who leave. We just hope that they’ll return.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenna nodded. “I understand.” She stood. “Michael, for now, please, don’t say this to anyone else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice Newbury stood in fear. “You—you think this could put our boy in danger?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just think that you should remain silent for now. I won’t tell anyone who will let it out of our realm of investigation, and you should just keep quiet, too,” Jenna told them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael, Sr., looked at his wife. “She’s saying yes, Alice. Mr. Sedge is dead. Accident, my foot. We’ll keep silent, Miss Duffy. Just as you say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m always silent at school,” Michael, Jr., told her gravely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s a wise move,” Jenna told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, the kids would never hurt me. I just don’t want to be accused of giving any of them the evil eye.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Were you there when it happened?” Jenna asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And what did you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated and shrugged. “I think David might have believed that’s what happened. But I know that he’d gotten called down a few days before—actually, by Mr. Andres. Mr. Andres really berated him for being so mean to Malachi. And Mr. Andres…well, he had a way of yelling at kids—well, not really yelling—but of making you feel really bad about what you did wrong. You know, he just had the right words, I guess. And that’s what he did with David Yates. So, maybe, when it happened, David was feeling guilty?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe,” Jenna agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael, Jr., smiled at her. “I feel bad for him, really. I know he uses his dad’s influence all the time to be kind of like a big man, but I think he believes sometimes that his dad doesn’t help him enough. You know, he probably just wants more attention from the guy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Michael, you seem to be wise beyond your years,” Jenna said, and he flushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thanked them again, shaking hands with the three of them. “If anyone asks me, I’ll just say that I was doing a routine interview, that you were polite and cooperative but couldn’t offer anything of consequence.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” Michael, Sr., told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenna hurried to her car, anxious to see the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam and Jackson stood at the door to the Sedge home. Sam carried a large basket with a smoked ham and an array of sides for the family; he and Jackson had decided that bearing food was the right thing to do—and that it was their way in, as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn attractive woman in her thirties, her expression drawn and her eyes tearstained, opened the door. She appeared to expect people but frowned when she saw them, not recognizing them as neighbors she knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Our deepest condolences,” Sam said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” she said, accepting their offering. “I assume you’re friends of my husband, Ricky? I mean, forgive me, I don’t know you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We were actually affiliated with Milton,” Sam said. “And I know that it’s a horrible time, but…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widened suddenly. “You’re the attorney!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sam Hall, yes,” he admitted, expecting the door to slam in his face. It didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My husband will want to see you,” she said, staring at Jackson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My colleague, Jackson Crow,” Sam explained quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded and opened the door wider. “Please come in. Neighbors are here—and my mom is out back with the kids—but Ricky is in his office. I’ll show you right in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRicky Sedge was behind his desk in his den, a small room with shelves that held books and trophies and pictures—family pictures. Sam winced inside, wishing he didn’t have to cause the man more pain. It was evident that his had been a close-knit family; most of the pictures were family shots, many of Milton Sedge holding two little boys, many with Sedge and his wife, and several of various weddings, two older couples with the next generation of Sedges. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-evil-inside-krewe-of-hunters-4/page-46.html","bookId":2278,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:33 PM"}
