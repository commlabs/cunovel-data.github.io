Hardin noted that thoughtfully and seatedhimself wearily\u0026nbsp; in a\u0026nbsp; comer just as\u0026nbsp; far from the other\u0026nbsp; five as possible.\n\u003cbr\u003e The Board\u0026nbsp; members did not seem\u0026nbsp; to object to that\u0026nbsp; arrangement. They spokeamong themselves\u0026nbsp; in whispers, which fell\u0026nbsp; off into sibilant monosyllables,and\u0026nbsp; then into\u0026nbsp; nothing at\u0026nbsp; all. Of\u0026nbsp; them all,\u0026nbsp; only Jord Fara\u0026nbsp; seemed evenreasonably calm.\u0026nbsp; He had produced a\u0026nbsp; watch and was staring\u0026nbsp; at it somberly.\n\u003cbr\u003e Hardin glanced at his\u0026nbsp; own watch and then at the glass cubicle ?absolutelyempty ? that dominated half the\u0026nbsp; room. It was the\u0026nbsp; only unusual feature ofthe\u0026nbsp; room, for\u0026nbsp; aside from that\u0026nbsp; there was\u0026nbsp; no indication that\u0026nbsp; somewhere acomputer was splitting off instants of time toward that precise moment whena muon stream would flow, a connection be made and?\n\u003cbr\u003e The lights went dim!\n\u003cbr\u003e They didn\u0027t\u0026nbsp; go out,\u0026nbsp; but merely yellowed\u0026nbsp; and sank with\u0026nbsp; a suddenness thatmade Hardin jump. He\u0026nbsp; had lifted his eyes to the ceiling lights in startledfashion,\u0026nbsp; and when\u0026nbsp; he brought them\u0026nbsp; down the\u0026nbsp; glass cubicle was\u0026nbsp; no longerempty.\n\u003cbr\u003e A figure occupied it ?a figure in a wheel chair!\n\u003cbr\u003e It said nothing for\u0026nbsp; a few moments, but it closed the book upon its lap andfingered\u0026nbsp; it idly.\u0026nbsp; And\u0026nbsp; then it\u0026nbsp; smiled, and\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; face seemed\u0026nbsp; all alive.\n\u003cbr\u003e It said, \"I am Hari Seldon.\" The voice was old and soft.\n\u003cbr\u003e Hardin almost\u0026nbsp; rose to acknowledge the\u0026nbsp; introduction and stopped himself inthe act.\n\u003cbr\u003e The voice\u0026nbsp; continued conversationally: \"As\u0026nbsp; you see, I am\u0026nbsp; confined to thischair and\u0026nbsp; cannot rise to greet you. Your\u0026nbsp; grandparents left for Terminus afew\u0026nbsp; months\u0026nbsp; back in\u0026nbsp; my\u0026nbsp; time\u0026nbsp; and since\u0026nbsp; then\u0026nbsp; I have\u0026nbsp; suffered a\u0026nbsp; ratherinconvenient paralysis.\u0026nbsp; I can\u0027t\u0026nbsp; see you, you\u0026nbsp; know, so I\u0026nbsp; can\u0027t greet youproperly.

I\u0027m not really here.\"Hardin fumbled for a\u0026nbsp; cigar almost automatically, but thought better of it.\n\u003cbr\u003e Hari Seldon put away\u0026nbsp; his book ?as if laying it upon\u0026nbsp; a desk at his side ?\n\u003cbr\u003e and when his fingers let go, it disappeared.\n\u003cbr\u003e He said:\u0026nbsp; \"It is\u0026nbsp; fifty years now\u0026nbsp; since this Foundation\u0026nbsp; was established ?\n\u003cbr\u003e fifty years\u0026nbsp; in which the members\u0026nbsp; of the Foundation have\u0026nbsp; been ignorant ofwhat\u0026nbsp; it\u0026nbsp; was they\u0026nbsp; were\u0026nbsp; working toward.\u0026nbsp; It\u0026nbsp; was necessary\u0026nbsp; that they\u0026nbsp; beignorant, but now the necessity is gone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"The Encyclopedia\u0026nbsp; Foundation, to\u0026nbsp; begin with, is\u0026nbsp; a fraud, and\u0026nbsp; always hasbeen!\"There\u0026nbsp; was a\u0026nbsp; sound\u0026nbsp; of a\u0026nbsp; scramble behind\u0026nbsp; Hardin and\u0026nbsp; one or\u0026nbsp; two muffledexclamations, but he did not turn around.\n\u003cbr\u003e Hari Seldon was, of\u0026nbsp; course, undisturbed. He went on: \"It is a fraud in thesense that neither I\u0026nbsp; nor my colleagues care at all whether a single volumeof the Encyclopedia is\u0026nbsp; ever published. It has served its purpose, since byit we\u0026nbsp; extracted an imperial charter\u0026nbsp; from the Emperor, by\u0026nbsp; it we attractedthe hundred thousand humans\u0026nbsp; necessary for our scheme, and by it we managedto keep\u0026nbsp; them preoccupied while events shaped\u0026nbsp; themselves, until it was toolate for any of them to draw back.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"In the fifty years that you have worked on this fraudulent project ?thereis no\u0026nbsp; use in\u0026nbsp; softening phrases ?your\u0026nbsp; retreat has been cut\u0026nbsp; off, and youhave now no choice\u0026nbsp; but to proceed on the infinitely more important projectthat was, and is, our real plan.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"To that end we have placed you on such a planet and at such a time that infifty\u0026nbsp; years you\u0026nbsp; were maneuvered\u0026nbsp; to the\u0026nbsp; point where\u0026nbsp; you no\u0026nbsp; longer havefreedom of\u0026nbsp; action. From now on, and into the\u0026nbsp; centuries, the path you musttake is\u0026nbsp; inevitable.

But now, at last, the Periphery is breakingaway and\u0026nbsp; the political unity of the Empire\u0026nbsp; is shattered. Somewhere in thefifty years\u0026nbsp; just past is where the historians of\u0026nbsp; the future will place anarbitrary\u0026nbsp; line and\u0026nbsp; say:\u0026nbsp; \u0027This marks\u0026nbsp; the Fall\u0026nbsp; of the\u0026nbsp; Galactic Empire.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \"And they\u0026nbsp; will be right, though scarcely any\u0026nbsp; will recognize that Fall foradditional centuries.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"And after\u0026nbsp; the Fall\u0026nbsp; will come inevitable\u0026nbsp; barbarism, a period\u0026nbsp; which, ourpsychohistory\u0026nbsp; tells us,\u0026nbsp; should,\u0026nbsp; under ordinary\u0026nbsp; circumstances, last\u0026nbsp; forthirty\u0026nbsp; thousand years.
