In their opinion, true essence reigned above all and even most Laws that martial artists comprehended were related to true essence and energy. Only true essence could possibly pair with Laws. As for a person’s bodily strength, Laws were incompatible with it. This was said to be because the rules of the Heavenly Dao changed a long time ago and now the body transformation technique cultivation system was far too difficult to cultivate.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThus, it was publicly recognized that bodily strength was inferior to true essence.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“No, this is wrong…” A top 10 ranked participant shook his head. “What Lin Ming is relying on is his physical strength to fight, but Wu Finalcloud is using his true essence to fight. His transcendent divine might gives him an explosive strength, enough to reach this current state.

For instance, if someone were to pour their true essence into a steel ball and throw it, it would crash down as hard as a meteor. This was the same effect as a body transformation martial artist hurling a steel ball with all their might.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This fellow Lin Ming cultivates in dual body and energy, and he has simultaneously reached incredibly high achievements in both the essence gathering system and the body transformation system.

Lin Ming’s figure faded, turning into a shadow that completely avoided the strike. This sword strike fell upon a black mountain, shearing a 10,000 section and creating a massive sloping cliff.

The Phoenix Blood Spear slightly bent as their weapons crossed and locked in place. Lin Ming grinned as he looked at Wu Finalcloud.

The blood energy within Wu Finalcloud’s body tumbled, his appearance in a very pitiful state. Although he had managed to save himself from injury thanks to his protective true essence, the fact that he had been thrown backwards was proof that he was on the losing end.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Wu Finalcloud is going to be defeated?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“His physical strength isn’t enough…? Unbelievable. Even in such a fierce melee, Lin Ming hasn’t seemed stressed at all from beginning to end, as if his physical strength hasn’t been consumed in the least, like he hasn’t been fighting all this time.

Just by looking at the ruined outskirts of True Marital City that had been changed beyond all recognition, one could imagine the massive quantities of energy involved in this battle.

After Lin Ming absorbed the Azure Dragon marrow and fused with the supreme dragon bone, and in addition to the Gate of Healing as well as the portion of power he absorbed from the Demon Bead replica, his blood vitality had reached an incredible degree. He was absolutely able to rely on his restorative abilities to continue this battle without consuming much or any of his strength at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“We still don’t know who will be the winner!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWu Finalcloud spat out.

Countless stones rose into the skies as a massive amount of energy erupted outwards. The heavy sword in Wu Finalcloud’s hand was sent soaring away as his protective true essence cracked open like an eggshell. Wu Finalcloud was directly struck by the Phoenix Blood Spear.

They had originally thought of taking revenge against Lin Ming once they all left the Divine Dream World, but now, everything had changed. In the future, if Lin Ming didn’t become a Great World King, he would still become an ordinary World King.

This should be able to resolve the conflicts between us… between us and Lin Ming, we weren’t life or death enemies to begin with… we can only hope that he doesn’t bear a grudge against us. As for killing him, we cannot do that. For someone like him, who will become a World King in the future, their destinies are terrifying. Not to mention sheltering him, but those super influences who want to be on good terms with him will definitely intervene on his behalf. And even if no one decides to shelter him, killing him will be a near-impossible task.
