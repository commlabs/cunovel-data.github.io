{"id":18953,"no":6,"title":"THE PARADISE OF BACHELORS AND THE TARTARUS OF MAIDS","content":"\u0026nbsp;The Paradise of Bachelors \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It lies not far from Temple-Bar.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Going to it, by the usual way, is like stealing from the heated plain into some cool, deep glen, shady among the harboring hills.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Sick with the din and soiled with the mud of Fleet Street—where the Benedick tradesmen are hurrying by, with ledger-lines ruled along their brows; thinking upon rise of bread and fall of babies—you adroitly turn a mystic corner—not a street—glide down a dim, monastic way, flanked by dark, sedate, and solemn piles, and still wending on, give the whole careworn world the slip, and, disentangled, stand beneath the quiet cloisters of the Paradise of Bachelors.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Sweet are the oases in Sahara; charming the isle-groves of August prairies; delectable pure faith amidst a thousand perfidies: but sweeter, still more charming, more delectable, the[168] dreamy Paradise of Bachelors, found in the stony heart of stunning London.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In mild meditation pace the cloisters; take your pleasure, sip your leisure, in the garden waterward; go linger in the ancient library; go worship in the sculptured chapel; but little have you seen, just nothing do you know, not the kernel have you tasted, till you dine among the banded Bachelors, and see their convivial eyes and glasses sparkle. Not dine in bustling commons, during term-time, in the hall; but tranquilly, by private hint, at a private table; some fine Templar\u0027s hospitality invited guest.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Templar? That\u0027s a romantic name. Let me see. Brian de Bois Gilbert was a Templar, I believe. Do we understand you to insinuate that those famous Templars still survive in modern London? May the ring of their armed heels be heard, and the rattle of their shields, as in mailed prayer the monk-knights kneel before the consecrated Host? Surely a monk-knight were a curious sight picking his way along the Strand, his gleaming corselet and snowy surcoat spattered by an omnibus. Long-bearded, too, according to his order\u0027s rule; his face fuzzy as a pard\u0027s; how would the grim ghost look[169] among the crop-haired, close-shaven citizens. We know indeed—sad history recounts it—that a moral blight tainted at last this sacred Brotherhood. Though no sworded foe might outskill them in the fence, yet the work of luxury crawled beneath their guard, gnawing the core of knightly troth, nibbling the monastic vows, till at last the monk\u0027s austerity relaxed to wassailing, and the sworn knights-bachelors grew to be but hypocrites and rakes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But for all this, quite unprepared were we to learn that Knights-Templars (if at all in being) were so entirely secularized as to be reduced from carving out immortal fame in glorious battling for the Holy Land, to the carving of roast mutton at a dinner-board. Like Anacreon, do these degenerate Templars now think it sweeter far to fall in banquet hall than in war? Or, indeed, how can there be any survival of that famous order? Templars in modern London! Templars in their red-cross mantles smoking cigars at the Divan! Templars crowded in a railway train, till, stacked with steel helmet, spear, and shield, the whole train looks like one elongated locomotive!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n No. The genuine Templar is long since departed.[170] Go view the wondrous tombs in the Temple Church; see there the rigidly-haughty forms stretched out, with crossed arms upon their stilly hearts, in everlasting undreaming rest. Like the years before the flood, the bold Knights-Templars are no more. Nevertheless, the name remains, and the nominal society, and the ancient grounds, and some of the ancient edifices. But the iron heel is changed to a boot of patent-leather; the long two-handed sword to a one-handed quill; the monk-giver of gratuitous ghostly counsel now counsels for a fee; the defender of the sarcophagus (if in good practice with his weapon) now has more than one case to defend; the vowed opener and clearer of all highways leading to the Holy Sepulchre, now has it in particular charge to check, to clog, to hinder, and embarrass all the courts and avenues of Law; the Knight-combatant of the Saracen, breasting spear-point at Acre, now fights law-points in Westminster Hall. The helmet is a wig. Struck by Time\u0027s enchanter\u0027s wand, the Templar is to-day a Lawyer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But, like many others tumbled from proud glory\u0027s height, like the apple, hard on the bough[171] but mellow on the ground, the Templar\u0027s fall has but made him all the finer fellow.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I dare say those old warrior-priests were but gruff and grouty at the best; cased in Birmingham hardware, how could their crimped arms give yours or mine a hearty shake? Their proud, ambitious, monkish souls clasped shut, like horn-book missals; their very faces clapped in bomb-shells; what sort of genial men were these? But best of comrades, most affable of hosts, capital diner is the modern Templar. His wit and wine are both of sparkling brands.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The church and cloisters, courts and vaults, lanes and passages, banquet-halls, refectories, libraries, terraces, gardens, broad walks, domicils, and dessert-rooms, covering a very large space of ground, and all grouped in central neighborhood and quite sequestered from the old city\u0027s surrounding din; and everything about the place being kept in most bachelor-like particularity, no part of London offers a quiet wight so agreeable a refuge.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Temple is, indeed, a city by itself. A city with all the best appurtenances, as the above enumeration shows. A city with a park to it, and flower-beds, and a riverside—the Thames[172] flowing by as openly, in one part, as by Eden\u0027s primal garden flowed the mild Euphrates. In what is now the Temple Garden the old Crusaders used to exercise their steeds and lances; the modern Templars now lounge on the benches beneath the trees, and switching their patent-leather boots, in gay discourse exercise at repartee.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Long lines of stately portraits in the banquet-halls, show what great men of mark—famous nobles, judges, and Lord Chancellors—have in their time been Templars. But all Templars are not known to universal fame; though, if the having warm hearts and warmer welcomes, full minds and fuller cellars, and giving good advice and glorious dinners, spiced with rare divertisements of fun and fancy, merit immortal mention, set down, ye muses, the names of R.F.C. and his imperial brother.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Though to be a Templar, in the one true sense, you must needs be a lawyer, or a student at the law, and be ceremoniously enrolled as member of the order, yet as many such, though they may have their offices there, just so, on the other hand, there are many residents of the hoary old domicils who are not admitted[173] Templars. If being, say, a lounging gentleman and bachelor, or a quiet, unmarried literary man, charmed with the soft seclusion of the spot, you much desire to pitch your shady tent among the rest in this serene encampment, then you must make some special friend among the order, and procure him to rent, in his name but at your charge, whatever vacant chamber you may find to suit.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Thus, I suppose, did Dr. Johnson, that nominal Benedick and widower but virtual bachelor, when for a space he resided here. So, too, did that undoubted bachelor and rare good soul, Charles Lamb. And hundreds more, of sterling spirits, Brethren of the Order of Celibacy, from time to time have dined, and slept, and tabernacled here. Indeed, the place is all a honeycomb of offices and domicils. Like any cheese, it is quite perforated through and through in all directions with the snug cells of bachelors. Dear, delightful spot! Ah! when I bethink me of the sweet hours there passed, enjoying such genial hospitalities beneath those time-honored roofs, my heart only finds due utterance through poetry; and, with a sigh, I softly sing, \"Carry me back to old Virginny!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [174]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Such then, at large, is the Paradise of Bachelors. And such I found it one pleasant afternoon in the smiling month of May, when, sallying from my hotel in Trafalgar Square, I went to keep my dinner-appointment with that fine Barrister, Bachelor, and Bencher, R.F.C. (he is the first and second, and should be the third; I hereby nominate him), whose card I kept fast pinched between my gloved forefinger and thumb, and every now and then snatched still another look at the pleasant address inscribed beneath the name, Number —, Elm Court, Templar.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At the core he was a right bluff, care-free, right comfortable, and most companionable Englishman. If on a first acquaintance he seemed reserved, quite icy in his air—patience; this champagne will thaw. And, if it never do, better frozen champagne than liquid vinegar.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There were nine gentlemen, all bachelors, at the dinner. One was from \"Number —, King\u0027s Bench Walk, Temple\"; a second, third and fourth, and fifth, from various courts or passages christened with some similarly rich resounding syllables. It was indeed a sort of Senate of the Bachelors, sent to this dinner from[175] widely-scattered districts, to represent the general celibacy of the Temple. Nay it was, by representation, a Grand Parliament of the best Bachelors in universal London; several of those present being from distant quarters of the town, noted immemorial seats of lawyers and unmarried men—Lincoln\u0027s Inn, Furnival\u0027s Inn; and one gentlemen upon whom I looked with a sort of collateral awe, hailed from the spot where Lord Verulam once abode a bachelor—Gray\u0027s Inn.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The apartment was well up toward heaven; I know not how many strange old stairs I climbed to get to it. But a good dinner, with famous company, should be well earned. No doubt our host had his dining-room so high with a view to secure the prior exercise necessary to the due relishing and digesting of it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The furniture was wonderfully unpretending, old, and snug. No new shining mahogany, sticky with undried varnish; no uncomfortably luxurious ottomans, and sofas too fine to use, vexed you in this sedate apartment. It is a thing which every sensible American should learn from every sensible Englishmen, that glare and glitter, gimcracks and gewgaws, are[176] not indispensable to domestic solacement. The American Benedick snatches, down-town, a tough chop in a gilded show-box; the English bachelor leisurely dines at home on that incomparable South Down of his, off a plain deal board.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The ceiling of the room was low. Who wants to dine under the dome of St. Peter\u0027s? High ceilings! If that is your demand, and the higher the better, and you be so very tall, then go dine out with the topping giraffe in the open air.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In good time the nine gentlemen sat down to nine covers, and soon were fairly under way.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If I remember right, ox-tail soup inaugurated the affair. Of a rich russet hue, its agreeable flavor dissipated my first confounding of its main ingredient with teamster\u0027s gads and the rawhides of ushers. (By way of interlude, we here drank a little claret.) Neptune\u0027s was the next tribute rendered—turbot coming second; snow-white, flaky, and just gelatinous enough, not too turtleish in its unctuousness. (At this point we refreshed ourselves with a glass of sherry.) After these light skirmishers had vanished, the heavy artillery of the feast marched in, led by that well-known English[177] generalissimo, roast beef. For aids-de-camp we had a saddle of mutton, a fat turkey, a chicken-pie, and endless other savory things; while for avant-couriers came nine silver flagons of humming ale. This heavy ordnance having departed on the track of the light skirmishers, a picked brigade of game-fowl encamped upon the board, their camp-fires lit by the ruddiest of decanters.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Tarts and puddings followed, with innumerable niceties; then cheese and crackers. (By way of ceremony, simply, only to keep up good old fashions, we here each drank a glass of good old port.)\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The cloth was now removed; and like Blucher\u0027s army coming in at the death on the field of Waterloo, in marched a fresh detachment of bottles, dusty with their hurried march.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All these manoeuvrings of the forces were superintended by a surprising old field marshal (I can not school myself to call him by the inglorious name of waiter), with snowy hair and napkin, and a head like Socrates. Amidst all the hilarity of the feast, intent on important business, he disdained to smile. Venerable man!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I have above endeavored to give some slight[178] schedule of the general plan of operations. But any one knows that a good, general dinner is a sort of pell-mell, indiscriminate affair, quite baffling to detail in all particulars. Thus, I spoke of taking a glass of claret, and a glass of sherry, and a glass of port, and a mug of ale—all at certain specific periods and times. But those were merely the state bumpers, so to speak. Innumerable impromptu glasses were drained between the periods of those grand imposing ones.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The nine bachelors seemed to have the most tender concern for each other\u0027s health. All the time, in flowing wine, they most earnestly expressed their sincerest wishes for the entire well-being and lasting hygiene of the gentlemen on the right and on the left. I noticed that when one of these kind bachelors desired a little more wine (just for his stomach\u0027s sake, like Timothy), he would not help himself to it unless some other bachelor would join him. It seemed held something indelicate, selfish and unfraternal to be seen taking a lonely, unparticipated glass. Meantime, as the wine ran apace, the spirits of the company grew more and more to perfect genialness and unconstraint.[179] They related all sorts of pleasant stories. Choice experiences in their private lives were now brought out, like choice brands of Moselle or Rhenish, only kept for particular company. One told us how mellowly he lived when a student at Oxford; with various spicy anecdotes of most frank-hearted noble lords, his liberal companions. Another bachelor, a gray-headed man, with a sunny face, who, by his own account, embraced every opportunity of leisure to cross over into the Low Countries, on sudden tours of inspection of the fine old Flemish architecture there—this learned, white-haired, sunny-faced old bachelor, excelled in his descriptions of the elaborate splendors of those old guild-halls, town-halls, and stadhold-houses, to be seen in the land of the ancient Flemings. A third was a great frequenter of the British Museum, and knew all about scores of wonderful antiquities, of Oriental manuscripts, and costly books without a duplicate. A fourth had lately returned from a trip to Old Granada, and, of course, was full of Saracenic scenery. A fifth had a funny case in law to tell. A sixth was erudite in wines. A seventh had a strange characteristic anecdote[180] of the private life of the Iron Duke, never printed, and never before announced in any public or private company. An eighth had lately been amusing his evening, now and then, with translating a comic poem of Pulci\u0027s. He quoted for us the more amusing passages.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And so the evening slipped along, the hours told, not by a water-clock, like King Alfred\u0027s but a wine-chronometer. Meantime the table seemed a sort of Epsom Heath; a regular ring, where the decanters galloped round. For fear one decanter should not with sufficient speed reach his destination, another was sent express after him to hurry him; and then a third to hurry the second; and so on with a fourth and fifth. And throughout all this nothing loud, nothing unmannerly, nothing turbulent. I am quite sure, from the scrupulous gravity and austerity of his air, that had Socrates, the field marshal, perceived aught of indecorum in the company he served, he would have forthwith departed without giving warning. I afterward learned that during the repast, an invalid bachelor in an adjoining chamber enjoyed his first sound refreshing slumber in three long weary weeks.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [181]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was the very perfection of quiet absorption of good living, good drinking, good feeling, and good talk. We were a band of brothers. Comfort—fraternal, household comfort, was the grand trait of the affair. Also, you would plainly see that these easy-hearted men had no wives or children to give an anxious thought. Almost all of them were travelers, too; and without any twinges of their consciences touching desertion of the fireside.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The thing called pain, the bugbear styled trouble—those two legends seemed preposterous to their bachelor imaginations. How could men of liberal sense, ripe scholarship in the world, and capacious philosophical and convivial understanding—how could they suffer themselves to be imposed upon by such monkish fables? Pain! Trouble! As well talk of Catholic miracles. No such thing.—Pass the sherry, Sir.—Pooh, pooh! Can\u0027t be!—The port, Sir, if you please. Nonsense; don\u0027t tell me so.—The decanter stops with you, Sir, I believe.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And so it went.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Not long after the cloth was drawn our host glanced significantly upon Socrates, who, solemnly stepping to a stand, returned with an[182] immense convolved horn, a regular Jericho horn, mounted with polished silver, and otherwise chased and curiously enriched; not omitting two lifelike goat\u0027s heads, with four more horns of solid silver, projecting from opposite sides of the mouth of the noble main horn.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Not having heard that our host was a performer on the bugle, I was surprised to see him lift this horn from the table, as if he were about to blow an inspiring blast. But I was relieved from this, and set quite right as touching the purposes of the horn, by his now inserting his thumb and forefinger into its mouth; whereupon a slight aroma was stirred up, and my nostrils were greeted with the smell of some choice Rappee. It was a mull of snuff. It went the rounds. Capital idea this, thought I, of taking snuff about this juncture. This goodly fashion must be introduced among my countrymen at home, further ruminated I.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The remarkable decorum of the nine bachelors—a decorum not to be affected by any quantity of wine—a decorum unassailable by any degree of mirthfulness—this was again set in a forcible light to me, by now observing that, though they took snuff very freely, yet[183] not a man so far violated the proprieties, or so far molested the invalid bachelor in the adjoining room as to indulge himself in a sneeze. The snuff was snuffed silently, as if it had been some fine innoxious powder brushed off the wings of butterflies.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But fine though they be, bachelors\u0027 dinners, like bachelors\u0027 lives, can not endure forever. The time came for breaking up. One by one the bachelors took their hats, and two by two, and arm-in-arm they descended, still conversing, to the flagging of the court; some going to their neighboring chambers to turn over the Decameron ere retiring for the night; some to smoke a cigar, promenading in the garden on the cool riverside; some to make for the street, call a hack and be driven snugly to their distant lodgings.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I was the last lingerer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well,\" said my smiling host, \"what do you think of the Temple here, and the sort of life we bachelors make out to live in it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Sir,\" said I, with a burst of admiring candor—\"Sir, this is the very Paradise of Bachelors!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [184]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Tarturus of Maids\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It lies not far from Woedolor Mountain in New England. Turning to the east, right out from among bright farms and sunny meadows, nodding in early June with odorous grasses, you enter ascendingly among bleak hills. These gradually close in upon a dusky pass, which, from the violent Gulf Stream of air unceasingly driving between its cloven walls of haggard rock, as well as from the tradition of a crazy spinster\u0027s hut having long ago stood somewhere hereabout, is called the Mad Maid\u0027s Bellows\u0027-pipe.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Winding along at the bottom of the gorge is a dangerously narrow wheel-road, occupying the bed of a former torrent. Following this road to its highest point, you stand as within a Dantean gateway. From the steepness of the walls here, their strangely ebon hue, and the sudden contraction of the gorge, this particular point is called the Black Notch. The ravine now expandingly descends into a great, purple, hopper-shaped hollow, far sunk among many Plutonian,[185] shaggy-wooded mountains. By the country people this hollow is called the Devil\u0027s Dungeon. Sounds of torrents fall on all sides upon the ear. These rapid waters unite at last in one turbid, brick-colored stream, boiling through a flume among enormous boulders. They call this strange-colored torrent Blood River. Gaining a dark precipice it wheels suddenly to the west, and makes one maniac spring of sixty feet into the arms of a stunted wood of gray-haired pines, between which it thence eddies on its further way down to the invisible lowlands.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Conspicuously crowning a rocky bluff high to one side, at the cataract\u0027s verge, is the ruin of an old saw-mill, built in those primitive times when vast pines and hemlocks superabounded throughout the neighboring region. The black-mossed bulk of those immense, rough-hewn, and spike-knotted logs, here and there tumbled all together, in long abandonment and decay, or left in solitary, perilous projection over the cataract\u0027s gloomy brink, impart to this rude wooden ruin not only much of the aspect of one of rough-quarried stone, but also a sort of feudal, Rhineland, and Thurmberg look, derived[186] from the pinnacled wildness of the neighborhood scenery.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Not far from the bottom of the Dungeon stands a large whitewashed building, relieved, like some great white sepulchre, against the sullen background of mountain-side firs, and other hardy evergreens, inaccessibly rising in grim terraces for some two thousand feet.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The building is a paper-mill.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Having embarked on a large scale in the seedsman\u0027s business (so extensively and broadcast, indeed, that at length my seeds were distributed through all the Eastern and Northern States, and even fell into the far soil of Missouri and the Carolinas), the demand for paper at my place became so great, that the expenditure soon amounted to a most important item in the general account. It need hardly be hinted how paper comes into use with seedsmen, as envelopes. These are mostly made of yellowish paper, folded square; and when filled, are all but flat, and being stamped, and superscribed with the nature of the seeds contained, assume not a little the appearance of business letters ready for the mail. Of these small envelopes I used an incredible quantity—several[187] hundred of thousands in a year. For a time I had purchased my paper from the wholesale dealers in a neighboring town. For economy\u0027s sake, and partly for the adventure of the trip, I now resolved to cross the mountains, some sixty miles, and order my future paper at the Devil\u0027s Dungeon paper-mill.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The sleighing being uncommonly fine toward the end of January, and promising to hold so for no small period, in spite of the bitter cold I started one gray Friday noon in my pung, well fitted with buffalo and wolf robes; and, spending one night on the road, next noon came in sight of Woedolor Mountain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The far summit fairly smoked with frost; white vapors curled up from its white-wooded top, as from a chimney. The intense congelation made the whole country look like one petrification. The steel shoes of my pung craunched and gritted over the vitreous, chippy snow, as if it had been broken glass. The forests here and there skirting the route, feeling the same all-stiffening influence, their inmost fibres penetrated with the cold, strangely groaned—not in the swaying branches merely, but likewise in the vertical trunk—as the fitful[188] gusts remorseless swept through them. Brittle with excessive frost, many colossal tough-grained maples, snapped in twain like pipe-stems, cumbered the unfeeling earth.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Flaked all over with frozen sweat, white as a milky ram, his nostrils at each breath sending forth two horn-shaped shoots of heated respiration, Black, my good horse, but six years old, started at a sudden turn, where, right across the track—not ten minutes fallen—an old distorted hemlock lay, darkly undulatory as an anaconda.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Gaining the Bellows\u0027-pipe, the violent blast, dead from behind, all but shoved my high-backed pung up-hill. The gust shrieked through the shivered pass, as if laden with lost spirits bound to the unhappy world. Ere gaining the summit, Black, my horse, as if exasperated by the cutting wind, slung out with his strong hind legs, tore the light pung straight up-hill, and sweeping grazingly through the narrow notch, sped downward madly past the ruined saw-mill. Into the Devil\u0027s Dungeon horse and cataract rushed together.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With might and main, quitting my seat and robes, and standing backward, with one foot[189] braced against the dashboard, I rasped and churned the bit, and stopped him just in time to avoid collision, at a turn, with the bleak nozzle of a rock, couchant like a lion in the way—a road-side rock.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At first I could not discover the paper-mill.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The whole hollow gleamed with the white, except, here and there, where a pinnacle of granite showed one wind-swept angle bare. The mountains stood pinned in shrouds—a pass of Alpine corpses. Where stands the mill? Suddenly a whirling, humming sound broke upon my ear. I looked, and there, like an arrested avalanche, lay the large whitewashed factory. It was subordinately surrounded by a cluster of other and smaller buildings, some of which, from their cheap, blank air, great length, gregarious windows, and comfortless expression, no doubt were boarding-houses of the operatives. A snow-white hamlet amidst the snows. Various rude, irregular squares and courts resulted from the somewhat picturesque clusterings of these buildings, owing to the broken, rocky nature of the ground, which forbade all method in their relative arrangement. Several narrow lanes and alleys, too, partly[190] blocked with snow fallen from the roof, cut up the hamlet in all directions.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When, turning from the traveled highway, jingling with bells of numerous farmers—who, availing themselves of the fine sleighing, were dragging their wood to market—and frequently diversified with swift cutters dashing from inn to inn of the scattered villages—when, I say, turning from that bustling main-road, I by degrees wound into the Mad Maid\u0027s Bellows\u0027-pipe, and saw the grim Black Notch beyond, then something latent, as well as something obvious in the time and scene, strangely brought back to my mind my first sight of dark and grimy Temple Bar. And when Black, my horse, went darting through the Notch, perilously grazing its rocky wall, I remembered being in a runaway London omnibus, which in much the same sort of style, though by no means at an equal rate, dashed through the ancient arch of Wren. Though the two objects did by no means correspond, yet this partial inadequacy but served to tinge the similitude not less with the vividness than the disorder of a dream. So that, when upon reining up at the protruding rock I at last caught sight of the[191] quaint groupings of the factory-buildings, and with the traveled highway and the Notch behind, found myself all alone, silently and privily stealing through deep-cloven passages into this sequestered spot, and saw the long, high-gabled main factory edifice, with a rude tower—for hoisting heavy boxes—at one end, standing among its crowded outbuildings and boarding-houses, as the Temple Church amidst the surrounding offices and dormitories, and when the marvelous retirement of this mysterious mountain nook fastened its whole spell upon me, then, what memory lacked, all tributary imagination furnished, and I said to myself, This is the very counterpart of the Paradise of Bachelors, but snowed upon, and frost-painted in a sepulchre.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dismounting, and warily picking my way down the dangerous declivity—horse and man both sliding now and then upon the icy ledges—at length I drove, or the blast drove me, into the largest square, before one side of the main edifice. Piercingly and shrilly the shotted blast blew by the corner; and redly and demoniacally boiled Blood River at one side. A long woodpile, of many scores of cords, all glittering in[192] mail of crusted ice, stood crosswise in the square. A row of horse-posts, their north sides plastered with adhesive snow, flanked the factory wall. The bleak frost packed and paved the square as with some ringing metal.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The inverted similitude recurred—\"The sweet, tranquil Temple garden, with the Thames bordering its green beds,\" strangely meditated I.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But where are the gay bachelors?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then, as I and my horse stood shivering in the wind-spray, a girl ran from a neighboring dormitory door, and throwing her thin apron over her bare head, made for the opposite building.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"One moment, my girl; is there no shed hereabouts which I may drive into?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Pausing, she turned upon me a face pale with work, and blue with cold; an eye supernatural with unrelated misery.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Nay,\" faltered I, \"I mistook you. Go on; I want nothing.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Leading my horse close to the door from which she had come, I knocked. Another pale, blue girl appeared, shivering in the doorway[193] as, to prevent the blast, she jealously held the door ajar.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Nay, I mistake again. In God\u0027s name shut the door. But hold, is there no man about?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That moment a dark-complexioned well-wrapped personage passed, making for the factory door, and spying him coming, the girl rapidly closed the other one.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Is there no horse-shed here, Sir?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yonder, the wood-shed,\" he replied, and disappeared inside the factory.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With much ado I managed to wedge in horse and pung between scattered piles of wood all sawn and split. Then, blanketing my horse, and piling my buffalo on the blanket\u0027s top, and tucking in its edges well around the breastband and breeching, so that the wind might not strip him bare, I tied him fast, and ran lamely for the factory door, still with frost, and cumbered with my driver\u0027s dread-naught.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Immediately I found myself standing in a spacious place, intolerably lighted by long rows of windows, focusing inward the snowy scene without.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At rows of blank-looking counters sat rows of blank-looking girls, white folders in their[194] blank hands, all blankly folding blank paper.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In one corner stood some huge frame of ponderous iron, with a vertical thing like a piston periodically rising and falling upon a heavy wooden block. Before it—its tame minister—stood a tall girl, feeding the iron animal with half-quires of rose-hued note paper, which, at every downward dab of the piston-like machine, received in the corner the impress of a wreath of roses. I looked from the rosy paper to the pallid cheek, but said nothing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Seated before a long apparatus, strung with long, slender strings like any harp, another girl was feeding it with foolscap sheets, which, so soon as they curiously traveled from her on the cords, were withdrawn at the opposite end of the machine by a second girl. They came to the first girl blank; they went to the second girl ruled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I looked upon the first girl\u0027s brow, and saw it was young and fair; I looked upon the the second girl\u0027s brow, and saw it was ruled and wrinkled. Then, as I still looked, the two—for some small variety to the monotony—changed places; and where had stood the young, fair brow, now stood the ruled and wrinkled one.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [195]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Perched high upon a narrow platform, and still higher upon a high stool crowning it, sat another figure serving some other iron animal; while below the platform sat her mate in some sort of reciprocal attendance.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Not a syllable was breathed. Nothing was heard but the low, steady overruling hum of the iron animals. The human voice was banished from the spot. Machinery—that vaunted slave of humanity—here stood menially served by human beings, who served mutely and cringingly as the slave serves the Sultan. The girls did not so much seem accessory wheels to the general machinery as mere cogs to the wheels.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All this scene around me was instantaneously taken in at one sweeping glance—even before I had proceeded to unwind the heavy fur tippet from around my neck. But as soon as this fell from me the dark-complexioned man, standing close by, raised a sudden cry, and seizing my arm, dragged me out into the open air, and without pausing for a word instantly caught up some congealed snow and began rubbing both my cheeks.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [196]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Two white spots like the whites of your eyes,\" he said; \"man, your cheeks are frozen.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That may well be,\" muttered I; \"\u0027tis some wonder the frost of the Devil\u0027s Dungeon strikes in no deeper. Rub away.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Soon a horrible, tearing pain caught at my reviving cheeks. Two gaunt blood-hounds, one on either side, seemed mumbling them. I seemed Actaeon.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Presently, when all was over, I re-entered the factory, made known my business, concluded it satisfactorily, and then begged to be conducted throughout the place to view it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Cupid is the boy for that,\" said the dark-complexioned man. \"Cupid!\" and by this odd fancy-name calling a dimpled, red-cheeked, spirited-looking, forward little fellow, who was rather impudently, I thought, gliding about among the passive-looking girls—like a gold fish through hueless waves—yet doing nothing in particular that I could see, the man bade him lead the stranger through the edifice.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Come first and see the water-wheel,\" said this lively lad, with the air of boyishly-brisk importance.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Quitting the folding-room, we crossed some[197] damp, cold boards, and stood beneath a great wet shed, incessantly showered with foam, like the green barnacled bow of some East Indiaman in a gale. Round and round here went the enormous revolutions of the dark colossal water-wheel, grim with its one immutable purpose.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"This sets our whole machinery a-going, Sir; in every part of all these buildings; where the girls work and all.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I looked, and saw that the turbid waters of Blood River had not changed their hue by coming under the use of man.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You make only blank paper; no printing of any sort, I suppose? All blank paper, don\u0027t you?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Certainly; what else should a paper-factory make?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The lad here looked at me as if suspicious of my common-sense.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, to be sure!\" said I, confused and stammering; \"it only struck me as so strange that red waters should turn out pale chee—paper, I mean.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He took me up a wet and rickety stair to a great light room, furnished with no visible[198] thing but rude, manger-like receptacles running all round its sides; and up to these mangers, like so many mares haltered to the rack stood rows of girls. Before each was vertically thrust up a long, glittering scythe, immovably fixed at bottom to the manger-edge. The curve of the scythe, and its having no snath to it, made it look exactly like a sword. To and fro, across the sharp edge, the girls forever dragged long strips of rags, washed white, picked from baskets at one side; thus ripping asunder every seam, and converting the tatters almost into lint. The air swam with the fine, poisonous particles, which from all sides darted, subtilely, as motes in sunbeams, into the lungs.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"This is the rag-room,\" coughed the boy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You find it rather stifling here,\" coughed I, in answer; \"but the girls don\u0027t cough.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, they are used to it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Where do you get such hosts of rags?\" picking up a handful from a basket.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Some from the country round about; some from far over sea—Leghorn and London.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"\u0027Tis not unlikely, then,\" murmured I, \"that among these heaps of rags there may be some[199] old shirts, gathered from the dormitories of the Paradise of Bachelors. But the buttons are all dropped off. Pray, my lad, do you ever find any bachelor\u0027s buttons hereabouts?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"None grow in this part of the country. The Devil\u0027s Dungeon is no place for flowers.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh! you mean the flowers so called—the Bachelor\u0027s Buttons?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And was not that what you asked about? Or did you mean the gold bosom-buttons of our boss, Old Bach, as our whispering girls all call him?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The man, then, I saw below is a bachelor, is he?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, yes, he\u0027s a Bach.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The edges of those swords, they are turned outward from the girls, if I see right; but their rags and fingers fly so, I can not distinctly see.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Turned outward.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yes, murmured I to myself; I see it now; turned outward; and each erected sword is so borne, edge-outward, before each girl. If my reading fails me not, just so, of old, condemned state-prisoners went from the hall of judgment to their doom; an officer before, bearing a sword, its edge turned outward, in significance[200] of their fatal sentence. So, through consumptive pallors of this blank, raggy life, go these white girls to death.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Those scythes look very sharp,\" again turning toward the boy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes; they have to keep them so. Look!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That moment two of the girls, dropping their rags, plied each a whetstone up and down the sword-blade. My unaccustomed blood curdled at the sharp shriek of the tormented steel.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Their own executioners; themselves whetting the very swords that slay them; meditated I.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What makes those girls so sheet-white, my lad?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why\"—with a roguish twinkle, pure ignorant drollery, not knowing heartlessness—\"I suppose the handling of such white bits of sheets all the time makes them so sheety.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Let us leave the rag-room now, my lad.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n More tragical and more inscrutably mysterious than any mystic sight, human or machine, throughout the factory, was the strange innocence of cruel-heartedness in this usage-hardened boy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And now,\" said he, cheerily, \"I suppose[201] you want to see our great machine, which cost us twelve thousand dollars only last autumn. That\u0027s the machine that makes the paper, too. This way, Sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Following him I crossed a large, bespattered place, with two great round vats in it, full of a white, wet, woolly-looking stuff, not unlike the albuminous part of an egg, soft-boiled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There,\" said Cupid, tapping the vats carelessly, \"these are the first beginning of the paper; this white pulp you see. Look how it swims bubbling round and round, moved by the paddle here. From hence it pours from both vats into the one common channel yonder; and so goes, mixed up and leisurely, to the great machine. And now for that.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He led me into a room, stifling with a strange, blood-like, abdominal heat, as if here, true enough, were being finally developed the germinous particles lately seen.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Before me, rolled out like some long Eastern manuscript, lay stretched one continuous length of iron framework—multitudinous and mystical, with all sorts of rollers, wheels, and cylinders, in slowly-measured and unceasing motion.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [202]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Here first comes the pulp now,\" said Cupid, pointing to the nighest end of the machine.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"See; first it pours out and spreads itself upon this wide, sloping board; and then—look—slides, thin and quivering, beneath the first roller there. Follow on now, and see it as it slides from under that to the next cylinder. There; see how it has become just a very little less pulpy now. One step more, and it grows still more to some slight consistence. Still another cylinder, and it is so knitted—though as yet mere dragon-fly wing—that it forms an air-bridge here, like a suspended cobweb, between two more separated rollers; and flowing over the last one, and under again, and doubling about there out of sight for a minute among all those mixed cylinders you indistinctly see, it reappears here, looking now at last a little less like pulp and more like paper, but still quite delicate and defective yet awhile. But—a little further onward, Sir, if you please—here now, at this further point, it puts on something of a real look, as if it might turn out to be something you might possibly handle in the end. But it\u0027s not yet done, Sir. Good way to travel yet, and plenty more of cylinders must roll it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [203]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Bless my soul!\" said I, amazed at the elongation, interminable convolutions, and deliberate slowness of the machine. \"It must take a long time for the pulp to pass from end to end, and come out paper.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, not so long,\" smiled the precocious lad, with a superior and patronizing air; \"only nine minutes. But look; you may try it for yourself. Have you a bit of paper? Ah! here\u0027s a bit on the floor. Now mark that with any word you please, and let me dab it on here, and we\u0027ll see how long before it comes out at the other end.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, let me see,\" said I, taking out my pencil. \"Come, I\u0027ll mark it with your name.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Bidding me take out my watch, Cupid adroitly dropped the inscribed slip on an exposed part of the incipient mass.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Instantly my eye marked the second-hand on my dial-plate.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Slowly I followed the slip, inch by inch: sometimes pausing for full half a minute as it disappeared beneath inscrutable groups of the lower cylinders, but only gradually to emerge again; and so, on, and on, and on—inch by inch; now in open sight, sliding along like a freckle on the quivering sheet; and then again[204] wholly vanished; and so, on, and on, and on—inch by inch; all the time the main sheet growing more and more to final firmness—when, suddenly, I saw a sort of paper-fall, not wholly unlike a water-fall; a scissory sound smote my ear, as of some cord being snapped; and down dropped an unfolded sheet of perfect foolscap, with my \"Cupid\" half faded out of it, and still moist and warm.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n My travels were at an end, for here was the end of the machine.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, how long was it?\" said Cupid.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Nine minutes to a second,\" replied I, watch in hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I told you so.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For a moment a curious emotion filled me, not wholly unlike that which one might experience at the fulfillment of some mysterious prophecy. But how absurd, thought I again; the thing is a mere machine, the essence of which is unvarying punctuality and precision.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Previously absorbed by the wheels and cylinders, my attention was now directed to a sad-looking woman standing by.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That is rather an elderly person so silently[205] tending the machine-end here. She would not seem wholly used to it either.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh,\" knowingly whispered Cupid, through the din, \"she only came last week. She was a nurse formerly. But the business is poor in these parts, and she\u0027s left it. But look at the paper she is piling there.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ay, foolscap,\" handling the piles of moist, warm sheets, which continually were being delivered into the woman\u0027s waiting hands. \"Don\u0027t you turn out anything but foolscap at this machine?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, sometimes, but not often, we turn out finer work—cream-laid and royal sheets, we call them. But foolscap being in chief demand we turn out foolscap most.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was very curious. Looking at that blank paper continually dropping, dropping, dropping, my mind ran on in wonderings of those strange uses to which those thousand sheets eventually would be put. All sorts of writings would be writ on those now vacant things—sermons, lawyers\u0027 briefs, physicians\u0027 prescriptions, love-letters, marriage certificates, bills of divorce, registers of births, death-warrants, and so on, without end. Then, recurring back[206] to them as they here lay all blank, I could not but bethink me of that celebrated comparison of John Locke, who, in demonstration of his theory that man had no innate ideas, compared the human mind at birth to a sheet of blank paper, something destined to be scribbled on, but what sort of characters no soul might tell.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Pacing slowly to and fro along the involved machine, still humming with its play, I was struck as well by the inevitability as the evolvement-power in all its motions.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Does that thin cobweb there,\" said I, pointing to the sheet in its more imperfect stage, \"does that never tear or break? It is marvelous fragile, and yet this machine it passes through is so mighty.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It never is known to tear a hair\u0027s point.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Does it never stop—get clogged?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No. It must go. The machinery makes it go just so; just that very way, and at that very pace you there plainly see it go. The pulp can\u0027t help going.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Something of awe now stole over me, as I gazed upon this inflexible iron animal. Always, more or less, machinery of this ponderous elaborate sort strikes, in some moods, strange[207] dread into the human heart, as some living, panting Behemoth might. But what made the thing I saw so specially terrible to me was the metallic necessity, the unbudging fatality which governed it. Though, here and there, I could not follow the thin, gauzy vail of pulp in the course of its more mysterious or entirely invisible advance, yet it was indubitable that, at those points where it eluded me, it still marched on in unvarying docility to the autocratic cunning of the machine. A fascination fastened on me. I stood spellbound and wandering in my soul. Before my eyes—there, passing in slow procession along the wheeling cylinders, I seemed to see, glued to the pallid incipience of the pulp, the yet more pallid faces of all the pallid girls I had eyed that heavy day. Slowly, mournfully, beseechingly, yet unresistingly, they gleamed along, their agony dimly outlined on the imperfect paper, like the print of the tormented face on the handkerchief of Saint Veronica.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Halloa! the heat of this room is too much for you,\" cried Cupid, staring at me.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No—I am rather chill, if anything.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Come out, Sir—out—out,\" and, with the[208] protecting air of a careful father, the precocious lad hurried me outside.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In a few minutes, feeling revived a little, I went into the folding-room—the first room I had entered, and where the desk for transacting business stood, surrounded by the blank counters and blank girls engaged at them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Cupid here has led me a strange tour,\" said I to the dark-complexioned man before mentioned, whom I had ere this discovered not only to be an old bachelor, but also the principal proprietor. \"Yours is a most wonderful factory. Your great machine is a miracle of inscrutable intricacy.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, all our visitors think it so. But we don\u0027t have many. We are in a very out-of-the-way corner here. Few inhabitants, too. Most of our girls come from far-off villages.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The girls,\" echoed I, glancing round at their silent forms. \"Why is it, Sir, that in most factories, female operatives, of whatever age, are indiscriminately called girls, never women?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh! as to that—why, I suppose, the fact of their being generally unmarried—that\u0027s the reason, I should think. But it never struck me[209] before. For our factory here, we will not have married women; they are apt to be off-and-on too much. We want none but steady workers; twelve hours to the day, day after day, through the three hundred and sixty-five days, excepting Sundays, Thanksgiving, and Fast-days. That\u0027s our rule. And so, having no married women, what females we have are rightly enough called girls.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then these are all maids,\" said I, while some pained homage to their pale virginity made me involuntarily bow.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"All maids.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Again the strange emotion filled me.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Your cheeks look whitish yet, Sir,\" said the man, gazing at me narrowly. \"You must be careful going home. Do they pain you at all now? It\u0027s a bad sign, if they do.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No doubt, Sir,\" answered I, \"when once I have got out of the Devil\u0027s Dungeon I shall feel them mending.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ah, yes; the winter air in valleys, or gorges, or any sunken place, is far colder and more bitter than elsewhere. You would hardly believe it now, but it is colder here than at the top of Woedolor Mountain.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [210]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I dare say it is, Sir. But time presses me; I must depart.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With that, remuffling myself in dread-naught and tippet, thrusting my hands into my huge sealskin mittens, I sallied out into the nipping air, and found poor Black, my horse, all cringing and doubled up with the cold.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Soon, wrapped in furs and meditations, I ascended from the Devil\u0027s Dungeon.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At the Black Notch I paused, and once more bethought me of Temple-Bar, Then, shooting through the pass, all alone with inscrutable nature, I exclaimed—Oh! Paradise of Bachelors! and oh! Tartarus of Maids!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2835/78392.html","bookId":1226,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 10:36:20 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 10:36:20 AM"}
