Every step taken by the huge beasts set the camp’s dogs to howling and he was in no mood for their brainless cries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf the night was gone. He had called in the clan leaders and the most senior elders, one and all crowding into the hut that had once belonged to Hadralt. They had come expect ing castigation, more condemnation from their new and much feared war leader, but Redmask had no interest in fur-ther belittling the warriors now under his command. The wounds of earlier that day were fresh enough. The courage they had lost could only be regained in battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor all of Hadralt’s faults, he had been correct in on thing-the old way of fighting against the Letherii was doomed to fail. Yet the now-dead war leader’s purported intent to retrain the Awl to a mode of combat identical to that of the Letherii was, Redmask told his followers, also doomed. The tradition did not exist, the Awl were skilled in the wrong weapons, and loyalties rarely crossed lines of clan and kin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new way had to be found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRedmask had then asked about the mercenaries that ha been hired, and the tale that unfolded had proved both complicated and sordid, details teased out from reluctant, shamefaced warriors. Oh, there had been plenty of Letherii coin delivered as part of the land purchase, and that wealth had been originally amassed with the intent of hiring a foreign army-one that had been found on the borderlands to the east. But Hadralt had then grown to covet all that gold and silver, so much so that he betrayed that army-led them to their deaths-rather than deliver the coin into their possession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch was the poison that was coin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere had these foreigners come from?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the sea, it appeared, a landing on the north coast of the wastelands, in transports under the flag of Lamatath, a distant peninsular kingdom. Soldier priests and priestesses, sworn to wolf deities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had brought them to this continent?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProphecy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRedmask had started at that answer, which came from Natarkas, the spokesman among the copper-faces, the same warrior who had revealed Hadralt’s murder of Capalah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA prophecy, War Leader, Natarkas had continued. A final war. They came seeking a place they called the Battlefield of the Gods. They called themselves the Grey Swords, the Reve of Togg and Fanderay. There were many women among them, including one of the commanders. The other is a man, one-eyed, who claims he has lost that eye three times-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, War Leader, this one still lives. A survivor of the battle. Hadralt imprisoned him. He lies in chains behind the women’s blood-hut-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatarkas had fallen silent then, recoiling at the sudden rage he clearly saw in Redmask’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now the masked war leader strode through the Ganetok encampment, eastward to the far edge where trenches had been carved into the slope, taking away the wastes of the Awl; to the hut of blood that belonged to the women, then behind it, where, chained to a stake, slept a filthy creature, the lower half of his battered body in the drainage trench, where women’s blood and urine trickled through mud, roots and stones on their way to the deep pits beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalting, then, to stand over the man, who awoke, turning his head to peer with one glittering eye up at Redmask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Do you understand me?’ the war leader asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What is your name?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lone eye blinked, and the man reached up to scratch the blistered scar tissue around the empty socket where his other eye had been. He then grunted, as if surprised, and struggled into a sitting position. ‘Anaster was my new name,’ he said; a strange twist of his mouth that might have been a grin, then the man added, ‘but I think my older name better suits me, with a slight alteration, that is. I am Toc.’ The smile broadened. ‘Toc the Unlucky.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am Redmask-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I know who you are. I even know what you are.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Can’t help you there.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRedmask tried again. ‘What hidden knowledge of me do you think you possess?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smile faded, and the man looked down, seeming to study the turgid stream of thinned blood round his knees. ‘It made little sense back then. Makes even less sense now. You’re not what we expected, Redmask.’ He coughed, then spat, careful to avoid the women’s blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Tell me what you expected?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother half-smile, yet Toc would not look up as he said, ‘Why, when one seeks the First Sword of the K’Chain Che’Malle, well, one assumes it would be… K’Chain Che’Malle. Not human. An obvious assumption, don’t you think?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘First Sword? I do not know this title.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-77.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
