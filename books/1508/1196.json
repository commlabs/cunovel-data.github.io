But the entire process occurred within a very brief window of time. Every time Lin Ming fought with the three people, there was a violent and savage collision between them. Yet he had done so ruthlessly and without hesitation and the thickness of his true essence was mind boggling.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“H-he won?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The battle is over?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe many participants present couldn’t believe their eyes. Although they expected Lin Ming’s strength might possibly faintly surpass the three prodigies of Sacred Martial Mansion, they never imagined it would surpass them to this degree. They weren’t even on the same level. From start to finish, Lin Ming had simply rolled over them!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSacred Yueping’s Time Laws were overwhelmed by Lin Ming’s higher level Laws, and Sacred Tianhao’s formidable defensive ability and Deep Earth Force Field were broken through with absolute strength.

Such an opponent was already beyond her level. Maybe she had the ability to face the joint attacks of Sacred Martial Mansion’s three prodigies, but wanting to defeat them would be far too difficult. As for completely suppressing them like Lin Ming had done, that was impossible.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming looked at Sacred Yueping.

A raging column of flames shot into the skies, swallowing everything.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSacred Yueping wildly screamed as his body disintegrated into ashes within the flames.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSacred Yueping had died!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter he died, his body turned into pure dreamland energy that shifted into various shapes in the air.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming put out his hand, taking all of this energy in.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe energy sunk into his body through his fingertips, nourishing the divine dream mark on his soul. During this process, Lin Ming also observed the reaction of all the martial artists around him. As he expected, besides him, no one could perceive this dreamland energy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis dreamland energy was an extremely special and unique form of energy. Although it seemed similar to things like the soul and mind, it was fundamentally different. This was not something that was as simple as energies used in divine soul attacks, but something on a completely different level.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Is this dreamland energy created by Empyrean Divine Dream? Or did she establish a completely new cultivation system based on the Divine Dream Law she discovered?” Lin Ming mumbled to himself, filled with an even greater curiosity towards Empyrean Divine Dream. It seemed that what Mo Eversnow said was true; Empyrean Divine Dream’s status was in no way inferior to Empyrean Primordius. She was someone who stood at the very peak of the entire Divine Realm.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter absorbing Sacred Yueping’s energy, Lin Ming looked at his own merit points. The number had risen yet again!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s merit points had originally been 3.36 million. But after killing Sacred Yueping, the number had increased by 2.97 million, jumping straight to 6.33 million!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd now, Lin Ming’s ranking had leapt to 17\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eth\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e of the True Martial Great World!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, this still wasn’t the end. Lin Ming looked at the disabled Sacred Tianhao, and Sacred Tianhao also looked back at Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSacred Tianhao’s lungs had been torn apart and his heart was nearly ripped to shreds; he was relying on his powerful vitality to hang onto his last dying breath.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe could no longer speak, but the icy cold intent in his eyes was vicious.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming smiled, not caring at all.

This was because his merit points had already surpassed Sacred Tianhao’s and he was only able to obtain 30% of his merit points.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“7.81 million, ranked 14\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eth\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e of the True Martial Great World!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“There’s still one last person.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming looked at the leftover Sacred Yanran. At this time, her body was covered in blood and her beautiful face was pale and waxy. Looking at her aroused the sympathy of any ordinary man. But Lin Ming’s emotions didn’t change. Without hesitation, he thrust out his spear and pierced through Sacred Yanran’s chest.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You are ruthless,” Sacred Yanran clutched at her chest as she spat out these final words. Finally, she could not change her destiny of being turned into energy which was absorbed by Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLike this, Sacred Martial Mansion’s three prodigies had all died!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s merit points had reached a dramatic number of 9.11 million.

If he doubled that and reached 11 million, he would have been able to reach the top 10. With that reasoning, it seemed that entering the top 5 required 20-30 million merit points. The top three would require an even more terrifying number. As for being number one, it was unknown just how many merit points were required to reach that high.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“That must be a crazy amount!” Lin Ming said. He glanced over at the other participants.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Lin Ming looked at these people, all of them felt their hearts stop beating for a moment. They subconsciously stepped away. But as they thought about it, there wasn’t any reason for Lin Ming to kill them. Their merit points were too low so there was no point in killing them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs they realized this they calmed down a bit.

Out of these trillions of geniuses, just what did it mean to rank first? Even the top disciple of the True Martial Holy Lands wasn’t arrogant enough to say he was ranked first in the True Martial Great World. He would only say that he led everyone else by a significant margin.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“After killing the three prodigies of Sacred Martial Mansion, the dreamland energy within my body has already reached an over-saturated level. It’s enough for me to go meditate on the dreamland Laws. Moreover, if I want to gain even more merit points, I’ll have to leave Immemorial City and hunt down the top masters of other cities. To me, that is just a waste of time. It’s better if I just return to the city to train for now,” Lin Ming thought to himself.

In the span of a single day, Zhong Wenshu and the three prodigies of Sacred Martial Mansion had all died and they had lost most of their merit points. For the next period of time, they would definitely be hunting down other participants to absorb their merit points.

In truth, he wasn’t sure just what heights Lin Ming could reach. After all, he didn’t understand just what secrets Lin Ming held and what happened at Carefree Palace. Personally, he felt that reaching the top 10 rankings of a great world was already giving Lin Ming plenty of praise. When Lin Mings’ ranking dramatically rose, that was clearly because he killed an ordinary World King Holy Land genius. To do that, he should have the strength to enter the top 10.
