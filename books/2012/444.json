No raw patches where my skin has torn away at the touch of metal .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have faced worse. Remember that – it’s what has kept you going battle after battle .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Forkrul Assail was walking ahead of her troops now, up towards a low rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaradan Sort suddenly looked down, studied the yellow, brittle grasses, the countless rodent holes. ‘Soldiers – anyone see any scorpions hereabouts?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chorus of grunts answered her, all in the negative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Good. That will do, then. Shields high – seems she’s got something to say to us!’ Gods, this is where it gets unfair .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling, Sister Freedom studied the enemy forces. Ah, we were wrong. They are not moments from routing . There was rage and stolid determination in the faces across from her, but none of that would help – not now. Shields and armour would resist the power she was about to unveil, would protect them – for a time. Perhaps a handful of heartbeats. But then her voice would tear through, claw away skin and muscle, spray blood into the air. Bones would snap, skulls would shatter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all about to die, and nothing they did would prevent that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs here, so too the rest of the world .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlancing to her left, she saw the centre advancing – now less than thirty paces distant from the motionless line of defenders. Archers were loosing arrow upon arrow, with the enemy’s own archers countering here and there. Soldiers were falling, though for most shields fended off the deadly rain. Twelve paces, and then the charge. Its weight will drive them back, break up that facing line, and into the gaps we will pour, splitting the formation apart. And then will come the slaughter .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReturning her attention to the flank opposite her, she raised her arms, began drawing breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flint sword that erupted from the ground beneath the Forkrul Assail ripped into the inside of her left thigh, lifting her into the air as the tip cracked and pierced her hip bone. As its wielder rose in a shower of earth, stones and roots, others burst from the ground surrounding the Forkrul Assail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeapons hammered into her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowling, writhing still on that sword, she lashed out. The back of one hand struck the forehead of Urugal the Woven, collapsing it inward, pitching the T’lan Imass from its feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalt Urmanal’s bone mace caught the Forkrul Assail under her left arm, spun her entirely around, boots skyward, and off from the skewering sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe landed with a roar, surging back to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeroke’s obsidian-tipped spear slid through her, exploding out from her lower belly. Twisting round, the Assail grasped hold of the spear shaft and lifted it into the air, taking Beroke with it. Releasing the wood, she reached up to trap Beroke’s skull between her hands as he slid closer to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a bellow she crushed the warrior’s skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her mind, Sister Freedom shouted commands to her officers. ‘ Charge the enemy – break through and encircle them! Kill every damned one of them! Leave these bone-bags to me! ’ The T’lan Imass with the crumpled forehead came towards her again. Snarling, she flung herself at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlistig could feel the desperate rage growing in him, and as the enemy ranks suddenly seemed to build like a rising wave and rush howling towards him, he screamed his own fury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe collision lifted soldiers from their feet, shoved them into the air. Blood misted, weapons hammered down, and the front ranks of the Malazans recoiled, and then stiffened. The clamour was deafening – weapons and shrieks – and the world was crazed before the Fist’s eyes, frantic with motion, the flash of faces, teeth bared, sudden gushes of blood from mouths and gaping throats. Bodies pushing up against his shins. Staggering, flaying with his sword, buffeted by repeated blows against his shield, Blistig fought with the ferocity of a rabid dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was going to die. They wanted to kill him – every damned one of them wanted to kill him, drag him down, trample his corpse. His life wasn’t supposed to end like this. He would fight, and fight. This was not going to be the end – he wouldn’t let it. I will not let it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChaos spun wild around him and the soldiers pressing against his sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were pushed back another step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLostara Yil moved up alongside the Adjunct, drawing her swords. Another dance. All I can do. The dance of the world – this fucking, miserable, murderous world . She saw Ruthan Gudd take Tavore’s other flank, and behind her she could hear Henar Vygulf – the fool was singing some damned Bluerose sea shanty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, advancing now, leaning forward and striding on stiff legs like a madman, came the Forkrul Assail. His eyes were feral and they were fixed on the Adjunct. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-444.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
