I was so determined for a vacation, and was worried my plans would be dashed to pieces. I’ll stay for another couple of days to observe, and if there really aren’t any problems I’ll be on my way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue lead Su He to Skyfire Avenue, where he’d arranged a room in a luxury hotel for his friend. After dropping him off, Lan Jue didn’t immediately return to his shop. Instead, he returned to where the high-alt verti-car had been waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Soulcaller gem hummed with power:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue: \u003cem\u003eI’m back.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Qianlin: \u003cem\u003eAh, you’re back quick!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat are you up to?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMeditation. What you taught me. I feel like it’s very useful. I can feel the energies moving within me, it’s very interesting. This is Discipline, huh? What exactly \u003c/em\u003eis\u003cem\u003e my Discipline?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eOnce your Discipline has been cultivated to a certain level, it will reveal itself on its own. Maybe you’ll turn in to a tigress.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYOU’RE \u003cem\u003ea tigress!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow about I go meet you. I bought a little special something on Lir I want to give you. And by the way I can see where you’re Discipline’s at.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAlright, so when will you be here?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTen minutes. I’ll meet you downstairs.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAlright, I’ll tell the guards.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eNo need. We don’t have to trouble others. I have my ways.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eOh.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir conversation ended there. Lan Jue’s McKelly verti-car soundlessly rose in to the air, and took off in a beam of light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Qianlin leaped from the bed and immediately went to her closet. She nibbled her lower lip as she rummaged through her options, eventually extricating a white dress. She changed quickly, pulling her loose hair in to a pony-tail. It was a very relaxed look. Her eyes couldn’t conceal her excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive minutes later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTap tap!\u003c/em\u003e A soft noise came from the window lattice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQianlin shot to her feet and made for the window. She drew back the window curtain to reveal Lan Jue outside, clad in black. [1. What is this, Interview with an Adept? Fifty Shades of Lan? Christ Mr. Angsty, how about some primary colors?]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shut of the infrared security measures, and pulled open the window. Lan Jue silently pulled himself in. Safely inside, Qianlin took a quick peep outside before shutting the window and pulling the curtain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re pretty good at skulking around. You’d make a good burglar.” Zhou Qianlin said through a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue couldn’t respond, he was too busy lost in thought after seeing her in the white dress. However, he recovered fairly quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How have things been at school these last few days?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. “Nothing special. Richard went back to the West and hasn’t returned. Other than that, everything’s more or less back to normal. Of course everyone’s still excited about the concert and our victory over Lir. They had quite the influence on our school. The mecha combat department is tearing ahead at full speed, and Professor Tan has been given tenure. She isn’t even thirty, and already the youngest tenured professor in the school’s history.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue smiled. “I’ll be taking that title in the near future, probably.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQianlin could only roll her eyes. “You. A tenured professor. Your work week consists of three days fishing, two days sunbathing. You can count the number of classes you’ve taught on one hand. Oh, by the way I heard a few students talking about you the other day. I had suggestions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?” Lan Jue replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They like your teaching style,” she began, “but your \u003cem\u003elife\u003c/em\u003estyle is very different from most of the students. So, I suggest you tailor your classes more towards things they’ll actually encounter. I bet that’ll get you an even better response.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue was speechless. His face was scrunched in thought as he pondered her recommendation. \u003cem\u003eShe’s right\u003c/em\u003e, he thought. \u003cem\u003eI’ve been addressing them, teaching them as though they were already nobility. That’s not a bad thing, but they’re still too young and too unrefined for a lot of the content. I think it best I teach them about fine liquors another time.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Qianlin went on. “I’m not saying your classes aren’t good, just…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue waved his hand, cutting her off. “I understand, you had good intentions. And you’re absolutely right. I really hadn’t thought about it until you said so, after all this is my first semester teaching. I’ll make the necessary changes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQianlin smiled pleasantly at him. “Great. It was your own decision to teach etiquette anyway. If you’d come as a mecha combat instructor we wouldn’t have anything to worry about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue huffed. “If I had all the other instructors would be out of a job. That’s no good, am I right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQianlin’s lips curled in to a smirk. “Megalomaniac.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue, taller than she, looked her over, followed the curve of her slender neck. He puckered his lips thoughtfully. “Alright, let me see how your Discipline is progressing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQianlin’s face reddened ever so slightly. “How are you going to do that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give your hand,” Lan Jue answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ok!” She stuck her hand out towards him. Just then, a voice called. “Qianlin? Are you asleep? You ate so little at dinner, I brought you a glass of warm milk. Drink it before you go to bed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice was getting closer. The last few words were spoken just outside her door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue, by this point, was holding her hand in his. For a moment the two of them were in a daze, unsure of what to do. It was the first time they’d encountered an interruption, especially under such clandestine circumstances, and both were at a loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eKnock, knock, knock!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue reacted first, pulling Qianlin in to his arms and speaking quietly in her ear. “Answer the door, I’ll hide.” He nudged her towards the voice, and she obliged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs her hand gripped the doorknob, she unconsciously turned back. Lan Jue was already gone from sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled open the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother, Bai Xiao [2. ‘White Dawn’], stood outside. In her hand she bore a tray, upon which was a glass of gently steaming milk, and a cookie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Qianlin, are you alright? Why is your face so red?” She walked in to the room, concern written on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine,” she replied hastily. “My face is red? Probably because I just took a shower, so I’m still a little hot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiao placed the treats she’d bought on a nearby nightstand. She gave her daughter the once over, her face skeptical. Her eyes narrowed as she noticed something on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, darling, your floor is so dirty!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQianlin gulped. “Really? Yeah I guess so. I’ll clean it up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiao nodded. “Go get a cloth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQianlin entered the bathroom connected to her room. Her heart beat like a drum; she didn’t know where Lan Jue was hiding, and he could be found at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled open the bathroom door. Lan Jue was nowhere to be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Qianlin left to find a rag, her mother furtively rushed to look under the bed. Then the writing desk. Then the closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQianlin returned in time to see her mother shuffling through her things. She blinked. “Ma, what are you doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiao shut the closet door, smiling sheepishly. “Mama’s just checking to see if you need any new clothes! It seems like you prefer white clothes these days. I see it more and more in your things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” she replied, nodding her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ai-you, [3. Literally the sound every middle-aged Chinese woman makes.]” Bai Xiao whined. “Mama’s tummy hurts. I’m going to use your restroom.” She didn’t wait for a response, immediately making for the door while covering her belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQianlin dropped in to a squat and begun cleaning up the dust on her floor. Tiny beads of sweat had begun to form on her brow. She mustn’t fall for her trap! How could she face her mother? A man in her room, so late at night…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a short while Bai Xiao reappeared from the bathroom. She smiled pleasantly. “Alright dear, make sure to go to sleep early, I’ll leave you to yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks mom. You make sure to rest, too.” Qianlin followed her mother to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce her mother was outside, and the door locked behind her, Qianlin breathed a long sigh of relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as she was about to call out for Lan Jue, a finger pressed against her red lips. The Soulcaller gem warmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“\u003cem\u003eShh\u003c/em\u003e.” [4. Aww yyeaaahh… https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dOtVyEZymUFo]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQianlin, wide-eyed, turned her head to look to the side. She spied Lan Jue, flickering in an undulating aura of blue light. He’d just crackled out from the nearby wall socket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer wide eyes looked at him incredulously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiao was outside her door, ear pressed to the wood. She waited patiently for something, a sound or sign that something was amiss. She eventually left, though suspicion was still clear on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue was back to normal shortly afterward, fully extricated from the power socket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alright, she’s gone.” It was Lan Jue’s turn to sigh. “Your mother must have been a forensic detective in a previous life. She has the eyes of a hawk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQianlin stuck her tongue out at him. “Yeah! I was told she used to be an investigator. A shrewd one. But how in the world did you get \u003cem\u003ein to\u003c/em\u003e a power socket?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lightning is my discipline,” he explained. “Part of that is I can become lightning. By virtue of the transformation I can follow any electrical or power line.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s amazing,” she said. “But, that means… you can enter my room through the socket, there’s no need for the window.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“\u003cem\u003eHack, cough, ehm!”\u003c/em\u003e Lan Jue’s mind filled with memories of the one time he’d done just that. He stuttered over himself as he answered. “I-impossible, see, cuz, your house has protective measures in place for electricity. Surge protectors and the like, right? I can only stay changed like that for a short time anyway. Yeah… yeah, so there ya go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really.” Zhou Qianlin fixed him with her gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue looked like the very avatar of truth and morality. “Of course really! Alright, let’s get on with this check.” He snatched up her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQianlin felt a tingle go through her arm, making her cheeks redden once more. She didn’t fight him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few minutes Lan Jue relinquished her hand. Now it was his turn to be shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your cultivation is progressing very quickly… unnaturally so. From nothing to something, and first-ranked too. It’s not a terribly difficult landmark to reach, but in only a few days? To improve so quickly, without any outside forces to help… it’s inconceivable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/skyfire-avenue/sfl-chapter-215\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/skyfire-avenue/sfl-chapter-217\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/skyfire-avenue/sfl-chapter-216","bookId":1509,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:56:07 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:56:07 AM"}
