Too early to hit the hay. He snagged the remote and started flipping through channels. About ten minutes into mindless surfing, his cell phone trilled. He looked at the caller ID. It read: private caller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGinger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKane answered on the fifth ring. “Hello?” His smile dried. “No, it’s okay. I told you to call me. I’ll be right over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time Brandt reached Jessie’s trailer on the outskirts of Moorcroft, he’d lost the edge of rage his clueless brothers’ comments had invoked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFew people knew about his temper. Brandt took great pains to keep it hidden, as it was an embarrassing trait he’d inherited from his father. He scowled. He’d rather have male pattern baldness than sudden bouts of fury with no outlet besides taking it out on the people he cared about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat in his truck and counted to one hundred before he got out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie answered the door in pajamas. Not sexy ones. Flannel. No lace. No frills. Which described Jessie to a “T”. She still looked damn sexy. It made Brandt feel like a fucking pervert to wonder if Jessie had worn skimpy lingerie in the two years she’d been Luke’s wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brandt. Thank God you’re here.” She stepped aside and waited for him to remove his outerwear and boots before heading down the hallway. “It’s in the bathroom. I turn on the taps for the shower and nothing happens.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How long has it been like this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It worked fine when I showered yesterday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Got water in the kitchen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did for a while, but now it’s tapered off to nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandt scratched his chin. “To be honest, it sounds like a major problem. If the entire system is frozen, you’ll have to crawl under the trailer and see what section froze up and try to thaw it with a torch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChances are good if it’s broken and leakin’, it’s caused more freeze ups down the line.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” Her pretty face fell and she absentmindedly batted a stray strawberry-blonde hair from her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would it help if I held the flashlight when we crawled under there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie just assumed he’d crawl under her trailer? At ten o’clock at night? With the temp stuck at three degrees?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot likely. Not even for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s using you. She’s using your guilt about Luke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever’s wrong is gonna have to wait until mornin’ and you can get a plumber or another qualified professional out here to take a look.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I assumed you could fix it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t fix everything, Jess.” Brandt sidestepped her and returned to the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paced in front of the pictures—dozens of them, all of Jessie and Luke. The room wasn’t a shrine, but as far as he could tell, it was awful damn close. Thing was, he didn’t blame her. He dropped onto the couch, too keyed up to relax into the puffy cushions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you like a beer?” she offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Soda, if you’ve got one, bein’s I have to drive back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie handed him a Diet Coke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn’t help matters that she sat close enough to him he could reach out and touch her. He cleared his throat. “So, you heard anything from your dad lately?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. “He called me from some podunk rodeo in Oklahoma. We didn’t talk long. Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just curious. Chase is back for a spell and it reminded me that your dad is still traveling the circuit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chase does a lot better as a professional rodeo cowboy after just a few years than my dad has in his entire rodeo career.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandt sipped his soda. “How’s your mom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good, I guess. She’s working at a coffee shop in Riverton.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pretty place, Riverton.” Lame, Brandt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She invited me to visit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should go.” Pause. “So, you guys busy at Sky Blue? Or is January as slow there as it is everywhere else?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe space between her eyebrows puckered with confusion. “What’s up with all the questions, Brandt?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bristled. “What? I can’t ask you about your family? Or your job?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not that… it’s just—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You prefer to keep the conversation focused on my dead brother? Or whatever chore or ‘favor’ you require of me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face turned as red as a radish and Brandt felt like a total heel. But his brothers had been right about one thing: it was time to fish or cut bait where Jessie was concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you hate helping me out so much then why are you here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandt locked his gaze to hers. “You know why I’m here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie blushed even more furiously. She started to get up but Brandt clamped his hand around her thigh, keeping her in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you drunk?” she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Are you blind?” he countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wh-what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do you think I run right over here every damn time you call me? Because I love fixin’ wiring or haulin’ shit around in my truck? No. I come here to see you. And the only time I can get your attention is when I’m helpin’ you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brandt—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can talk about this later. At my place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No buts. You’re out of water. I want you to come home with me tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAwareness of the strings to his offer flashed in her eyes. The color drained from her face. “Why are you doing this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because it’s past time, Jessie.” He brought her hand to his lips. “I care about you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what you came all the way out here to tell me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I cut short my poker game because you called me and begged me to come. I had time to think on the way over. Time to get up my courage to ask about you and me…if there is a you and me. Or even a chance for a you and me in the near future.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes fairly shimmered with tears. “You thought that you and I…” She swallowed hard. “Brandt, I think of you as my brother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly fuck that stung.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I couldn’t imagine us being…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus, Jessie, just say the fucking word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandt snapped, “You can’t imagine us bein’ lovers?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. Vehemently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirect hit. She could imagine him crawling under her goddamn trailer house, but couldn’t fathom him crawling into her bed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrief, so raw and debilitating, nearly doubled him over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter what seemed an eternity—but was probably only a minute—Brandt managed to stand. He didn’t say a word to her as he slipped on his boots and outerwear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” Jessie blurted. “I just don’t want to give you false hopes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not you, it’s—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whirled on her. “If you say it’s not you, it’s me, I swear to fuckin’ God I’ll punch a hole in this cheap-ass paneling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie was taken aback by his violent outburst. “I wasn’t gonna say me. I was gonna say…it’s Luke.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s dead.” And again, Brandt felt like a fucking heel for making her flinch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. But even after more than a year, neither one of us has really let him go, have we?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandt froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re upset, I understand. I’ve spent the last year and a half upset.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jessie, I’m—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry? Yeah, me too. Go home, forget about this, and we’ll talk later, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to tell her it was all or nothing. He couldn’t be just friends and her errand boy anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words stuck in his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Drive safe, Brandt. I’ll call you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Brandt knew she would. Probably tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he also knew the next time Jessie’s number flashed on his phone, he wouldn’t pick up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Fourteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKane made it to Ginger’s house in record time. Hayden stood at the door waiting for him, his face pale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s awful sick and I thought she’d get mad if I called 911.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s your grandpa?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s having one of his away weekends…” The boy’s voice broke and his chin trembled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hayden. It’s okay. You did the right thing callin’ me.” Kane shed his winter clothing. “How long’s she been sick?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since she came home from work yesterday. She got up when the senior bus picked Grandpa up this morning. And after he left, Mommy went back to bed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHayden had been fending for himself since this morning? “What’ve you been doin’ all day?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuilt colored his cheeks. “Playing Xbox.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least the kid didn’t lie. “Tell you what. How about if you let me check on your mama and then we’ll figure out what to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.” But instead of staying in the living room, Hayden clutched Kane’s hand and followed him down the hallway to Ginger’s bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKane didn’t bother knocking. Ginger was sprawled in the middle of the bed in a skimpy nightgown, but he didn’t allow his gaze to linger on her generous, nearly naked attributes. The tangled covers were an indication she hadn’t been resting peacefully. He glanced at the window. She had to be feverish to crack the window open when it was nine degrees outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is she gonna be okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If she needs to go to the hospital I’ll take her myself. We’ll both take her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHayden leaned against him, pressing his face into Kane’s rib cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoor kid. Kane gave him a one-armed hug and moved to sit on the bed. He placed his hand on Ginger’s forehead. Damn, she was burning up. “Do you know where your mama keeps the thermometer?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/raising-kane-rough-riders-9/page-31.html","bookId":2689,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:19 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:19 AM"}
