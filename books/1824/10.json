He was the same man she\u0027d noticed outside on the steps. He was occupied, texting on his phone. He obviously wasn\u0027t interested in the discussion, and yet he wasn\u0027t leaving. He looked up, and for the briefest of seconds their eyes met. She could have sworn he smiled at her. She was certain she had never seen him before. She definitely would have remembered a man as fine-looking as that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moderator finally stopped the question-and-answer period by stepping forward and thanking Jordan for participating in the forum. Those still in the auditorium showed their appreciation with a round of applause. As she waited in her seat for Jordan to say good-bye to the moderator, Allison noticed a message on her phone from Dan. He was at the library and wanted her to text him when she was ready to walk home. He\u0027d walk with her. She smiled when she read it. Dan was such a worrywart, but she was secretly grateful he considered himself her protector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison quickly slipped her phone back into her pocket and made her way to the stage to say hello to Jordan, who was just coming down the steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was I as boring as I thought I was?\" Jordan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moderator had turned out the stage lights and was locking up the auditorium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you weren\u0027t boring at all. How come some of those computer science boys were so condescending?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beats me,\" Jordan answered. \"You put them to shame tonight,\" she added, grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison texted Dan as they made their way to the exit. She looked around for the mysterious stranger who had been watching from the back of the auditorium, but he had disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two friends didn\u0027t have much time to catch up while they waited on the steps outside, because Dan appeared almost immediately. He and Allison walked Jordan to her car and then backtracked toward their house. On their walk home she told Dan about her programming discussion with Jordan during the seminar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do realize I\u0027m an econ major, and everything you\u0027ve just said sounds like gibberish to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. \"Sorry. I guess I was getting a little technical, wasn\u0027t I?\" After a minute she said, \"I was showing off tonight. I shouldn\u0027t have done that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? There\u0027s nothing wrong with letting people know how smart you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe disagreed. \"I don\u0027t want to draw attention. It could get me into trouble.\"\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of trouble could you get into? It\u0027s not like you broke the law or anything,\" he said, and then teasing her with a raised eyebrow and an exaggerated look of suspicion, he added, \"Or did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, of course not,\" she laughed, averting her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he only knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFOUR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver spring break Allison planned to get ahead of her classwork, but her aunt and uncle demanded that she take on another modeling assignment because the attorney\u0027s bill had grown to staggering heights. She knew she could refuse. She was over eighteen, and they had no legal control over her, but saying no simply wasn\u0027t worth the barrage of calls and constant harassment. She wouldn\u0027t put it past them to follow her into class and make a scene to get what they wanted. It was always easier-and inevitable-to give in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeeping Will out of jail was becoming more and more difficult. He had been ordered by one judge to attend anger management classes. Allison hoped more than anything that these would help, but she had her doubts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately Giovanni was ready to photograph the catalog for his new line and was overjoyed that Allison would be available. The photos were shot along the beautifully rugged coast of Maine, and for two weeks Allison posed, as a team of hairstylists, makeup artists, and dressers hovered around her, primping and preening. On the day she returned home to Boston, Jordan called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re back,\" Jordan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison could hear the eagerness in her voice. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How would you like to visit the FBI\u0027s new office building with me this afternoon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison immediately declined. The last few weeks had been exhausting and she wanted a day to recuperate, but when Jordan mentioned they would be visiting the new cyber center, she reconsidered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agent Jim Phillips is a friend of Noah\u0027s and mine,\" Jordan explained. \"Noah\u0027s worked with him in the past, and we\u0027ve known him a long time. He\u0027s head of the cyber task force in Boston. I hear the facility is state-of-the-art, and I\u0027m dying to see it. He just called me and asked if I\u0027d like to come and tour it today. He knew who you were and told me I could bring you along, too. What do you say?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-10.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
