Pierre Cloucharde was fast asleep. He did not see the figure hunched over him. The needle of a stolen syringe glinted in the dark. Then it disappeared into the IV tube just above Cloucharde\u0027s wrist. The hypodermic contained 30 cc of cleaning fluid stolen from a janitor\u0027s cart. With great force, a strong thumb rammed the plunger down and forced the bluish liquid into the old man\u0027s veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCloucharde was awake only for a few seconds. He might have screamed in pain had a strong hand not been clamped across his mouth. He lay trapped on his cot, pinned beneath a seemingly immovable weight. He could feel the pocket of fire searing its way up his arm. There was an excruciating pain traveling through his armpit, his chest, and then, like a million shattering pieces of glass, it hit his brain. Cloucharde saw a brilliant flash of light... and then nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visitor released his grip and peered through the darkness at the name on the medical chart. Then he slipped silently out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the street, the man in wire-rim glasses reached to a tiny device attached to his belt. The rectangular pack was about the size of a credit card. It was a prototype of the new Monocle computer. Developed by the U.S. Navy to help technicians record battery voltages in cramped quarters on submarines, the miniature computer packed a cellular modem and the newest advances in micro technology. Its visual monitor was a transparent liquid crystal display, mounted in the left lens of a pair of eyeglasses. The Monocle reflected a whole new age in personal computing; the user could now look through his data and still interact with the world around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Monocle\u0027s real coup, though, was not its miniature display but rather its data entry system. A user entered information via tiny contacts fixed to his fingertips; touching the contacts together in sequence mimicked a shorthand similar to court stenography. The computer would then translate the shorthand into English.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe killer pressed a tiny switch, and his glasses flickered to life. His hands inconspicuously at his sides, he began touching different fingertips together in rapid succession. A message appeared before his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSUBJECT: P. CLOUCHARDE-TERMINATED\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. Transmitting notification of kills was part of his assignment. But including victim\u0027s names... that, to the man in the wire-rim glasses, was elegance. His fingers flashed again, and his cellular modem activated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMESSAGE SENT\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/digital-fortress/page-26.html","bookId":2226,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:05 PM"}
