Then I remembered what had happened after we’d parked it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, it had been a sweet ride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lots of good memories in that car,” she said. “Lost my virginity in it. Was proposed to in it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t realize I’d clutched my chest until my palm was pressing hard against my heart, hoping the organ didn’t crumble on the spot. I felt it tearing, though, splitting apart as her words echoed through my head and bruised my conscience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t speak until we reached the parking lot across the street from the club and Felicity opened the driver’s door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” I said so quietly I kind of hoped she didn’t hear me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she paused and glanced back. “For what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For not being able to keep all the promises I made to you that night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only promise I knew for sure that I’d kept was that I still loved her, for all the good that accomplished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry, too,” she murmured. “I’m sorry you don’t think you can keep them, even though I know you really could.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter she got out, shut her door, and stalked away, I stared after her, aching and wishing I really could return to being the Knox she’d once known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I can’t,” I whispered and finally got out of the car too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a busy night, thank God. I worked the bar with Noel, who made sure to tell me he did not agree with Pick’s decision to move Felicity and me in together. Then he warned me if I hurt her, I’d regret it. Other than that, business was too hectic for us to chitchat. Asher’s band played, and the number of female fans he’d collected in the past few weeks made the place more crowded than I’d ever seen it before. They chanted for him to play his song about the girl in the Incubus shirt, but he absolutely refused. Instead, he played something else that was new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelicity avoided me altogether, taking her orders to Noel. I had to admit, I hated the distance more than I was grateful that she was finally keeping it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t take much more of the constant tug-of-war inside me. I’d been a fool to think I could get this close to her and not be close to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the doors closed, only the workers and band members lingered. I was putting away cleaned cups when the drummer approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom across the room and up on stage, I hadn’t gotten a good look at him before, hadn’t even paid attention to any of the other members aside from Asher. But as he plopped onto the stool across the counter from me and asked for a Bud Light in a bottle, I shook my head, unable to believe I was seeing what I was actually seeing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked for his identification, and he gave me some lip about how all the other bartenders had just given him a drink without harassing him first. But I held out a hand and arched an eyebrow, because I had to see what the name would say, even though I was sure I already knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe growled out a sound, but dug into his wallet and handed me a piece of plastic. The name read Rock Parkinson, which made me snort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nice ID.” I handed it back with two fingers. “It almost looks real.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell?” The kid scowled. “It is real, fucker. What’re you trying to say? You think I’m not old enough to drink a goddamn beer?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s exactly what I think,” I spit back. “Because I know you’re only eighteen...Rocket.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth fell open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I guess you’re going by just Rock now. The Parkinson part, though?” I sniffed in disdain. “Honestly, I would’ve chosen something as far from Parker as possible if I were you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the...fuck?” He shook his head, boggled. “Do I know you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should. I’m your brother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flew off the stool, gaping at me as he backed away. “What? That’s not...” Then he fell to a stop before cocking his head to the side and whispering, “Knox?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strange elation rippled through my chest. My brother. I’d found one of my brothers. I wanted to leap over the counter and yank him into a hug, and yet a gut feeling told me to keep it cool. Distant. So I followed my gut. “Been a while, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What...how...holy shit? When’d you get out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Couple weeks ago,” I said. “I didn’t learn about...everyone until I was released. When I heard you and Cobra were still alive, I tried to find you.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-124.html","bookId":2715,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:19 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:19 AM"}
