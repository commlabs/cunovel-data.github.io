He had both of his eyes closed and both hands folded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe training for the majority of the year had forced a hint of stubborness to appear on the young man’s delicate and smooth face. His tight lips showed how determined he was and his original white skin that was as white as a woman’s had become slightly yellow with the beatings in the past months. His small physique didn’t seem too muscular but had the burst potential like a jaguar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking from every angle, the young man was transforming at a terrifying speed and when this transformation was done, he would shock everyone!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the smooth breathing of the young man, strands of green airflow slowly lifted from the wood basin and followed the young man’s breath into his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e…..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will get to 7 Duan Qi today!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he was training, Xiao Yan suddenly had the thought pop into his head. Even though there was no proof to back the thought up, it felt as if it was the word of god, the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the previous month, Xiao Yan had attempted to get to 7 Duan Qi quite a few times but every time failure would greet him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it was because today’s training was basically the last drop to a full cup but finally, Xiao Yan knew that he would get to 7 Duan Qi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sudden thought made Xiao Yan almost break his folded hands apart and exit from training. Thankfully, Xiao Yan was able to suppress the thought and take an effort to calm down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs his breath calmed, Xiao Yan started to greedily absorb energy to break through 7 Duan Qi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the wooden basin, the green elixir started emitting seven colored sparkles as countless strands evaporated and rushed into Xiao Yan’s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the green airflows increased in number, they not only covered Xiao Yan’s body but also hid the wooden basin within a layer of green mist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder Xiao Yan’s absorption of the energy, the green liquid within the basin was paling considerably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of the huge amount of energy that he absorbed, Xiao Yan’s small face began to flush red but also glow hints of green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan who was rushing 7 Duan Qi had undoubtedly become a huge huge magnet, not only sucking energy from the surrounding air but also creating mini whirlpools within the wood basin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the first 9 Duan Qis, 1 to 3 Duan Qi were considered low level, 4 to 6 Duan Qi were middle level and 7 to 9 Duan Qi were high leveled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 7th Duan Qi was basically a gap between Duan Qis, once one gets to 7 Duan Qi then they would have gotten to the high leveled Duan Qi and have a couple times as much Dou Qi compared to 6 Duan Qi. Therefore, 7 Duan Qi was considered as the first lock to becoming a Dou Zhe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the green whirlpools, the green liquid within the basin became lighter and lighter in color before changing to a bowl of clear water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout the energy from the Foundation Elixir, the green aura around Xiao Yan’s face slackened and he could only absorb the energy in the air to complete his 7 Duan Qi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though it was possible to use the energy in the air to break through 7 Duan Qi but it would take much longer and even if he does get to 7 Duan Qi, he would need an entire month before he would find himself truly at the level of 7 Duan Qi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what Xiao Yan was missing the most, was time!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the Foundation Elixir finally gave out, Xiao Yan’s black ring flickered and a jade green Foundation Elixir droplet fell into the basin. Suddenly, the clear water turned back into a shade of dark green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the fresh Foundation Elixir’s energy, Xiao Yan silently thanked Yao Lao and while keeping his hands folded, controlled his breathing to crazily absorb the new energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter crazily absorbing energy for an entire hour, Xiao Yan finally slowed down and at this point, the dark green water had paled by a few shades!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking in the final strand of energy, Xiao Yan body, after a brief pause, started shaking violently. His stomach pushed in while his eyes suddenly opened. Within the black pupils were hints of white and green. Finally, opening his mouth, Xiao Yan let out a breath of stale air…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the stale breath left Xiao Yan, he finally straightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his eyes blankly staring forward, Xiao Yan turned his neck to meet crisp bone cracking sounds. Then he curled his hand to feel a solid strength that brought a smile to Xiao Yan’s lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Finally, 7 Duan Qi…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing his eyes, Xiao Yan started to explore the abundant Dou Qi within his body….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-26\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-28\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-27","bookId":1497,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:52 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:52 AM"}
