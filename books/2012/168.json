Oh yes, look at Jastara now. But you forget, she lost the man she loved. She too was wounded. Maybe even broken. Of course, she couldn’t show it, couldn’t indulge in it, because while wife she may no longer be, mother she remains .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat of me? My pain? His arms are the wrong arms, but the embrace is still warm, and strong. His shoulder has taken my tears. What am I to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she held back, and the others looked at her, and whispered things to each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Her courage has failed her,’ murmured Shelemasa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanavat sighed. ‘Perhaps tomorrow, then.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I don’t know what she thinks she can say,’ the younger woman said. ‘To make this right. Cast him out is what she should do.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanavat glanced across at Shelemasa. ‘So that is what everyone is saying, is it? That hard tone, those hard words. The most plentiful coin, spent so freely, is also the most worthless one.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShelemasa frowned. ‘What do you mean?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘When you are judgemental, all the paint in the world cannot hide the ugliness of your face. The viciousness inside pushes through and twists every feature.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I – I am sorry, Hanavat. I was thinking of you—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And you would take what you imagine to be my feelings and speak them back to me. You proclaim yourself the warrior at my side, the line standing firm, to give comfort to me – I understand all that, Shelemasa. Yet what I hear from you – what I see in the eyes of the others – has nothing to do with me. Have I asked for pity? Have I asked for allies in this hidden war? Is there even any war at all? You presume much.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘She will not speak to you—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And how brave would you be in her stead? Her father-in-law has seduced her, taken her to his bed. Or she him, either way makes no difference. Do you think I do not know my own husband? He is difficult to resist in the best of times, and now in his pain and his need … well, not a woman or man here could defeat his will. But you see, you are all safe. From him. Freeing you to cast judgement upon the one woman now in his snare. Not upon my husband, however – for what might that say about me? Do not speak to me of sides in this. There are none. There are but people. People of all sorts, each doing what they can to get by.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And if what they do hurts others? Hanavat, will you martyr yourself? Will you weep for Jastara, too, who hides every day in his arms?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ah, see how I have stung you? You in your cruel judgement. My husband in his need. Jastara in her weakness. They are one and all acts of selfishness. Acts of pushing away .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How can you say that? I despise what they’ve done to you!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And it tastes sweet, yes? Listen to me. I too am a widow, now. And a mother who has lost her children. Have I need for an embrace? A stolen moment of love? Should I feel hatred for Gall and Jastara, for finding what I cannot?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShelemasa’s expression was appalled. Tears streaked down through the white paint on her face. ‘Is it not your husband you should look to for that?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘While he still faces away from me, I cannot.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then he’s the coward!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘To look into my eyes,’ Hanavat said, ‘is to see all that we once shared, and have now lost. It is too much to bear, and not just for my husband. Yes,’ she added, ‘I carry his last child, and if that child is not his, well, that is for me to know, in my heart, but never to be spoken. For now, I have that much – I have what I need to hold on, Shelemasa. And now, so does Gall.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe younger woman shook her head. ‘Then you stand alone, Mother. He has taken his son’s widow. That is unforgivable.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Better, Shelemasa. Much better. You see, Jastara does not deserve your hate. Not those looks, those whispers behind her back. No, instead, to be true sisters to her, you must go to her. Comfort her. And when you have done that – when all of you have done that – then I shall go to her, and take her into my arms.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenar Vygulf remembered the day he acquired his first horse. His father, whose shattered hip five years earlier had ended his riding days, had limped at his side, using his cane, as they made their way out to the pasture. A new herd had been culled from the wild herds of the high mountain plateaus, and twenty-three of the magnificent beasts now moved restlessly about in the enclosure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was high, shrinking shadows underfoot, and the wind swept steady down the slopes, combing the high grasses, warm and sweet with the flavours of early autumn. Henar was nine years old. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-168.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
