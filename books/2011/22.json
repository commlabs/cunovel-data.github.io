His long, tapered fingers stroked the stem of his wineglass, and I flashed to how it felt when he\u0027d caressed my hand as I unleashed all my electricity into him. Warmth spread through me that I told myself was the effects from the wine, but I knew better. Three hours and two kisses with Maximus hadn\u0027t made me feel as much as a glimmer of heat, but less than five minutes sitting across from Vlad and I was mentally fanning myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow his expression did change-into a slow, knowing smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see? You don\u0027t react this way with every man,\" he said with satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing would make me happier than to tell him he was wrong, but I did feel something for Vlad that I hadn\u0027t felt for anyone else. Maybe he was right and it was that damn darkness in me recognizing a kindred spirit. That didn\u0027t make him any less hazardous to my physical or emotional well-being, however.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop,\" I said quietly. \"Find someone else to toy with. We both know I lack experience, so I don\u0027t know how to play the game without getting hurt. Besides, I hate games. I prefer knowing straight up what\u0027s real and what\u0027s bullcrap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat back, something lurking in his gaze that tempted me despite knowing better. I gulped my wine for a distraction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s your directness and refusal to lie to yourself that I find most appealing. And I\u0027m not toying with you. I\u0027m very serious about making you mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held the wine in my mouth for a long moment before swallowing. Not to test the flavors this time, but in an effort to gain control. Two Leilas seemed to be battling it out inside of me. The first was outraged that he still considered it a fait accompli that I\u0027d give in to him, and the second . . . that slutty bitch was wondering what Vlad looked like naked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis teeth flashed in a wicked grin. \"Many women wonder, but few find out. I\u0027m very selective in my lovers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you\u0027re so special?\" I couldn\u0027t help but ask with open sarcasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat grin faded and his expression became serious. \"Because at points in my life, I\u0027ve lost everything. This house, my other homes, the cars, planes . . . they\u0027re my possessions, but anyone could own them. My body is the only thing that\u0027s truly mine, so I don\u0027t give it away as though it\u0027s worthless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d lost everything before, too. It was worse than death in some ways, so I wasn\u0027t surprised that it had had a lasting effect on Vlad. Loss seemed to haunt him, from the source of his darkest sin all the way to this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Again I say my mind reading doesn\u0027t come close to your abilities,\" Vlad said softly. \"You saw right into my soul with one touch. How does overhearing a few thoughts compare to that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced away, clearing my throat. \"I don\u0027t know. Some of those thoughts I\u0027d really rather you not have heard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled, low and decadent. \"Ah, but those were the ones I most enjoyed hearing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any luck rounding up items for me to touch?\" I asked, desperately trying to change the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad still had a devilish glint in his eye, but he let the previous topic drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have enemies, but they\u0027re not open in their stance against me. Probably because I tend to kill my adversaries rather quickly, so first I have to determine who\u0027s paying me lip service, and who\u0027s wishing me dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could help with that.\" I leaned forward, anxious to find the person who\u0027d dragged me into this. \"Get me items from the top ten people you think might be double-talking you. I\u0027ll touch them and tell you who is and who isn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis sly grin was back. \"Oh, Leila. Now you\u0027re just making yourself irresistible to me, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drained the rest of my wine, wishing he\u0027d stick to being either terrifying or charming. Being both wreaked havoc on my equilibrium. \"Serving dinner yet? I\u0027m starving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI woke up with a groan at the sunlight streaming in. My sleep had been interrupted by dreams that had me waking with my heart pounding and my nightgown damp with sweat. They weren\u0027t nightmares where I relived Jackal kidnapping me, but they did feature a vampire. One who hadn\u0027t been doing anything against my will, but had left me gasping and pleading for more-and my dream lover hadn\u0027t been Maximus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swung my legs over the side of the bed. I was no stranger to wanting something I couldn\u0027t have, and there were two remedies I knew that could help. One I couldn\u0027t indulge in because the mind-reading vampire who haunted my sleep would know what I was doing, and worse-he\u0027d know I was thinking about him while I was doing it. That left the other remedy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though I still felt like a piece of meat someone had hammered for maximum tenderness, I got up and went over to the dresser, pulling out a pair of pants and a runner\u0027s bra. Maximus told me this house had an exercise room. I was going to find that room and burn off all my misdirected, useless lust until I was too tired to fantasize about anything except a nap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce I was dressed, I went downstairs. The great hall looked empty, but I knew better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello? I need to know where the gym is,\" I stated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could mentally count to three, a figure slipped out from behind one of the tall stone pillars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is below this floor,\" the vampire said, an Irish brogue adding a pleasant cadence to his speech. \"I will escort you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d started to smile in thanks when a familiar, far more subtly accented voice made me freeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No need, Lachlan. I\u0027ll show her where it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mentally groaned. It was bad enough trying to exorcise Vlad from my thoughts when I only saw him at dinner. If I ran into him during the day as well, I didn\u0027t stand a chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd thanks to his damn mind reading, now he knew that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLachlan bowed to Vlad and vanished again. I waited, not turning my head. A scarred hand slid along my arm, leaving gooseflesh in its wake more from my reaction to his touch than the result of his heated flesh compared to the hall\u0027s chillier temperature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you always this warm?\" I asked, not looking at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething tall and dark filled my peripheral vision. \"If I\u0027m utilizing my power, I\u0027m even warmer, but you know that. If I\u0027m asleep, my temperature drops to that of a normal vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo every part of him would be at least this heated. Didn\u0027t that invite musings I was better off not having?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gym,\" I managed to say. \"Where is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers closed over my arm. \"Come with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew I\u0027d follow him, so his hand on my arm wasn\u0027t necessary. He\u0027d chosen my right side, too, so if I wasn\u0027t careful, my hand would brush him and I might glimpse that erotic vision again. I never do anything unless I\u0027m sure, he\u0027d said. Was he daring me to see if that vision remained unchanged? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-22.html","bookId":2011,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:47 PM"}
