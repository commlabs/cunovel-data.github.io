At this moment, rich disbelief was present on Sha Li’s face. He lowered his head and looked at the wound on his chest, before his body involuntarily trembled. He was clearly aware just how powerful his Demon Shark Scale Skin was. In fact, even Qing Teng’s all-out attack was unable to break it. Yet, it was easily broken by Lin Dong, who was merely at Perfect Profound Life Stage!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is this possible?” Sha Li muttered. His face quickly became somewhat distorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You trash, how is it possible that you can break my Demon Shark Scale Skin!” Sha Li suddenly lifted his head. His eyes were incomparably vicious as he glared at Lin Dong, while a scream was unleashed from his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Swish!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, a phantom like figure appeared in front of him in a flash, as his cry sounded. A scepter figure accompanied by an extremely violent wind unhesitatingly struck towards his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind was filled with icy cold murderous intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was this murderous intent that caused Sha Li’s forehead to be quickly covered by cold perspiration. Only at this moment, did he realise that Lin Dong was genuinely planning on killing him…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bastard!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSha Li clenched his teeth. He hurriedly crossed his hands in front of him in a defensive fashion. Following which, the Yuan Power within his body surged out like floodwater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lightning Emperor Scepter ruthlessly smashed against Sha Li’s arms. At the same time, the palm sized light formation on the tip of the scepter flicked. Another strange light beam shot out. Soon after, the Demon Shark Scale Skin on Sha Li’s arm quickly melted away like snow facing a raging flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damnit!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSha Li’s expression changed drastically as the Demon Shark Scale Skin on his arms melted away. However, a curse had only just escaped from his mouth, when a massive force gushed against his arms like a volcano. It directly shattered the huge rock behind him while his body was also thrown back by another few thousand feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, before Sha Li’s could stabilise his body, Lin Dong once again appeared in front of him in a phantom like fashion. Meanwhile, the Lightning Emperor Scepter in his hand had turned into countless shadows that surrounded the sky. Following which, all these shadows mercilessly rained down on an ashen looking Sha Li.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang bang bang bang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLow and deep deafening sound reverberated over the air like firecrackers. Many sharp scepter shadows exploded on Sha Li’s body with a terrifying force. Meanwhile, the latter also quickly fell from the sky…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Qing Teng saw Sha Li, who was unable to put up an ounce of resistance in the face of Lin Dong’s violent attacks, he was momentarily stunned. Only having fought with Sha Li personally, did he understand the terrifying endurance and defence that the latter possessed. Yet, this person in front of him was about to be turned into a dead stray…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, there were other experts climbing up this peak. However, after they climbed up, their faces became distorted when they saw Sha Li being blasted by Lin Dong and falling to the ground. Lin Dong’s violent temper really caused one’s heart to shudder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get lost!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong’s eyes were cold and sharp like blades. His hand gripped his Lightning Emperor Scepter tightly. Next, he swung it down furiously and struck heavily onto the arm of a blood covered Sha Li..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of bone cracking stealthily spread before Sha Li spat out another mouthful of fresh blood. With a face plastered with fear, he stared at a murderous man, who was holding his Lightning Emperor Scepter and walking over. Finally, horror began to surge on his dark and solemn face. Immediately, he quickly clenched his fist and shattered the spirit seal in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe space around Sha Li began to distort after he shattered his spirit seal. Subsequently, the space was just like a huge mouth as it swallowed the extremely miserable looking, blood covered Sha Li.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lin Dong, I will not let you off!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn extremely sharp roar was emitted from the point where Sha Li had disappeared before it resounded across the entire mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough his roar was filled with fury, it was possible to identify some fear within. Clearly, Lin Dong’s extremely violent attacks had left a mark within the heart of this expert from the Blood Demon Shark clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chi.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong stared at a disappearing Sha Li before he curled his lips. Promptly, he loosened the grip on his Lightning Emperor Scepter. That fellow’s so-called Demon Shark Scale Skin was indeed unique. It was likely that it will require at least an attack from an advance Profound Death Stage expert in order to break his defences. If it was not because Lin Dong’s Ancient Universe Formation possessed a disintegrating ability, it was likely that he would not be able to easily defeat Sha Li.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, some other figures beside Qing Teng had also appeared on this peak. However, none of them dared to attack after they spotted Lin Dong hovering in mid-air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong lowered his head. His eyes looked at everyone on the peak. Waving the Lightning Emperor Scepter in his hand, he asked with a smile, “Is there anyone else who wants a fight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone below exchanged glances with each other and shook their heads. What a joke. This person was just like a murderous god at the moment and who would dare to fight with him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You win. This peak’s mountain seal belongs to you.” Qing Teng laughed bitterly and sighed. At this moment, he had no choice but to admit that Lin Dong indeed possessed strength and qualifications that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efar surpass them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong smiled and unceremoniously accepted his victory. Lifting his head, he looked at the top of this mountain. A light seal was slowly rotating at that spot. Once he obtained it, he would have the qualifications to fight for the Thunderbolt Ancestral Symbol…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong moved. He directly penetrated through the clouds and appeared at the peak. Subsequently, he grabbed the mountain seal in his hand. Following which, Lin Dong could sense the surrounding clouds becoming increasingly dense after the mountain seal entered his hand. A light ripple spread from under his feet like a circular wave…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong raised his head. Currently, he had reached the highest point in this realm. His sight penetrated through the cloud and he was even able to see the boundaries of the vast forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dense light pillar shot from the seal in Lin Dong’s hand towards the sky. Light pillar covered his body, giving it a glaring appearance…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong looked at the light pillar around him. Subsequently, his eyes looked into the distance. Amidst the dense clouds, there were nine other mountain peaks that were still being covered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwoosh!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, this did not continue on for long. Many bright light pillars suddenly shot towards the sky. Soon after, the dense cloud scattered and many figures with powerful auras began to slowly emerge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong’s eyes narrowed as he looked at the figures within those light pillars. His fist involuntarily clenched tightly…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong’s vision became increasingly clear. Soon after, two most eye-catching figures were the first to appear within Lin Dong’s sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of them was completely decked out in black. He wore a smile on his face that caused one to tremble… It was Hua Chen…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the peak to the left of Hua Chen, a black robed man was leaning on a stone wall. His hat and veil were lifted as a breeze blew over, revealing a strange face that was covered with bandages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Faceless person… Xu Xiu…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong stared at these two individuals before a sharp expression suddenly appeared in his eyes. The two of them had indeed successfully arrived here...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The two of them… it’s time for them to show up…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong inhaled a deep breath of air. After which, he turned his head to look at two other peaks. Subsequently, two familiar figures began to show up. A fiery red haired figure and a blue figure, they were Tang Xinlian and Zhou Ze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight pillars also shot up from the other four peaks. One of them was also a familiar face. He was the fifth ranked individual on the rookie list, Teng Kui, who was quite powerful as well. Being able to secure a mountain seal was only expected. The other three individuals however, were somewhat foreign faces. However, all of them had powerful auras. Clearly, they were the dark horses that had emerged during the competition…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter they appeared on the mountaintop, Tang Xinlian and Zhou Ze quickly scanned their surroundings. Soon after, they glanced at Lin Dong before finally focusing their attention on Hua Chen and Xu Xiu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth of them knew that these two people were going to be their most troublesome opponents during the competition!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is one more peak…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong suddenly looked at the final peak as a light pillar rose from it. After which, a delicate small figure clearly appeared from within the light pillar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bang!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe large coffin cover held by that small and delicate fight, was heavily thrusted into the mountain peak. Meanwhile, her exquisite small face revealed a brilliant smile towards Lin Dong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, Mu Lingshan’s clothes appeared slightly tattered. Clearly, she had experienced a bitter battle previously. However, Lin Dong was somewhat surprised when he realized that Mu Lingshan’s aura seemed to be much stronger when compared to before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat little lass has actually broken through to the Profound Death Stage!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This little lass is truly full of surprises…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong laughed softly. Only then, did the worry in his heart completely disappear. It seems like there was really no need for him to fret over Mu Lingshan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Next… the main event shall begin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong’s attention once again turned towards the two dark figures in the distance. Like a lightning dragon, a lightning glow slowly gathered deep within his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1010\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1012\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-1011","bookId":1514,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:57 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:57 AM"}
