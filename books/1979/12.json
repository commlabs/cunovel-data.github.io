But it might be best to forget that, uh, particular part of last night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress approached with pad and pen in hand. They placed their orders, then Valerie resumed the conversation. “Maybe you can forget the kissing,” she said in a mild tone, “but I don’t think it’ll be possible for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColby’s gaze left hers. “Personally, I don’t think I’ll be able to forget it, either,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both fell silent but a faint smile curved her lips as she savored his words. He’d tried to dismiss the attraction between them and couldn’t. Neither could she.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t change anything,” he told her, his voice calm and resolute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d meant everything he’d said earlier; that much Valerie understood. She couldn’t change who she was. Easy as it would be to fall in love with him, Valerie knew she’d never be truly happy as a homemaker. She had too much ambition, too many dreams. A business career was what she wanted, where her skills lay, and she couldn’t relinquish that any more than Colby could give up his medical practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your father’s doing remarkably well,” Colby told her in an obvious attempt to change the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie was delighted. Norah had told her repeatedly what excellent progress their father was making, and it was thrilling to have it confirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve got him listed as critical at the moment,” Colby went on, “but I have a feeling he’s going to surprise us all and live to be a hundred.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie beamed Colby a happy smile, hardly able to speak for the emotion clogging her throat. “We owe you so much, Colby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged off her thanks and seemed grateful that the waitress appeared just then to deliver the first course of their meal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soup was delicious, but after a few spoonfuls Valerie was finished, her appetite gone. She managed only a taste of her fettucine. Colby glanced over, frowning, when she pushed the plate aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is something wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You hardly touched your meal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s wrong?” he pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie lowered her eyes. “I was just trying to decide how I was going to leave you, Colby, and not cry.” She hadn’t meant to sound quite so serious; she’d meant to sound wryly amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words silenced him. His eyes met hers, and when he spoke, his voice revealed his sincerity. “You’d be very easy to love.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But.” She said the dreaded word for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But we both know it wouldn’t work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re right,” she said convincingly. Why wouldn’t her heart listen?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Valerie.” Her father smiled weakly as she entered the cubicle in SICU. His hand reached for hers, brought it to his lips. “I wondered when I’d see you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…went out for dinner.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All by yourself?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” But she didn’t want to tell him she’d been with Colby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, there were other things to discuss. Norah had told Valerie the most unbelievable story. Apparently while Valerie was out for dinner, their father had told Norah about a vision he’d had. A vision? Valerie didn’t know what to make of that, any more than Norah did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s all this Norah was telling me?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again her father smiled, only this time it was brighter and there was a sparkle in his tired eyes. “I died, you know. Ask Colby if you don’t believe me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVaguely Valerie remembered Colby saying something about her father’s heart stopping and restarting, and considering it a miracle. “I know we’re very fortunate to have you with us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More fortunate than you realize. Now, I don’t want you getting all excited the way your sister did, but I don’t expect you will. I had what those television reporters call a near-death experience.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The long dark tunnel with the light at the end?” Valerie had certainly heard about the phenomenon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope,” he said, shaking his head. “I was in a garden.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Garden of Eden?” she asked lightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Might’ve been. I couldn’t say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn’t been aware that she was joking. “I didn’t notice the trees so much, but there might’ve been an apple. What I did notice was the pretty woman tending the roses.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom?” Valerie breathed the question, hardly knowing where it came from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid smiled and shut his eyes. “We had a good, long talk, your mother and I. She convinced me it wasn’t my time to die, that there’s still plenty for me to do on this earth. I wasn’t pleased to hear it because I’ve been thinking for some time now that I’d rather be with her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Daddy, I don’t—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shush now, because I have a lot to tell you and I’m getting weaker.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your mother loves you and is very proud of everything you’ve accomplished, but she said you should take time to enjoy life before it passes you by.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat sounded like something her mother would say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She also told me I was an old fool to try and match you up with Colby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But—” She snapped her mouth closed, unwilling to say more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grace feels my pushing the two of you to marry was ridiculous. Said I should apologize for that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie remained silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s more,” David continued, “lots more. Grace wanted to be sure she gave me plenty of reasons to come back to this world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m very glad she convinced you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father’s eyes drifted shut, but he opened them again with apparent effort. “She talked to me about Stephanie and Norah, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good, Daddy,” she said softly, patting his hand. “You can tell me all about it next time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Want to explain now…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shh, sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re all going to get married. Your mother assured me all three of you would.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course we will. Eventually.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Soon. Very…soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m glad,” she whispered, although she wasn’t sure he heard her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo her father had gone through a near-death experience. Valerie didn’t know how much credence to put in what he was saying. Marriage was the farthest thing from her mind at the moment. Obviously, marrying Colby was out of the question. And—without even noticing—she’d lost interest in the idea of a relationship with Rowdy Cassidy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She gave me twelve reasons to live,” her father announced sleepily. “Twelve very good reasons.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eValerie recalled that Norah had said something about the number six. She couldn’t imagine why her father was speaking in figures all of a sudden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Twelve reasons,” Valerie echoed, then leaned forward to kiss his cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father’s eyes fluttered open and he grinned boyishly. “Yup, my grandchildren. You, my darling Valerie, are going to give me three. All within the next few years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When’s the last time you spoke to your father?” Colby asked Valerie when she arrived at the hospital the next morning, carrying an armful of apple blossoms for the nurses’ station. He seemed to be waiting for her, and none too patiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed, realizing what must have happened. “I take it Dad told you about his experience in the Garden of Eden?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was the Garden of Eden?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Figuratively, I suppose.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you know, then,” Colby muttered. A hint of a frown flickered across his expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look at it this way—at least Dad’s given up his matchmaking efforts.” Valerie had assumed Colby would be happy about that, so his reaction puzzled her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis scowl deepened. “He apologized for even making the suggestion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See, what’d I tell you?” Valerie said, her mouth quirking with a smile. “We’re both in the clear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, this wasn’t what Colby wanted to hear, either. “He also claimed you’d be married before the end of the summer—and that you’d present him with three grandchildren.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the next few years. It looks like I’m going to be busy, doesn’t it?” Valerie hadn’t taken her father’s announcement too seriously; he’d had some kind of pleasant hallucination, and if it made him feel better, if it gave him a reason for living, then that was fine. She’d go along with it, although she wouldn’t actively encourage him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, it was highly unlikely she’d marry anytime soon, and even if she did, she had no intention of leaping into this motherhood business. Marriage would be enough of an adjustment. She enjoyed children, and naturally assumed she’d eventually want a family, but definitely not in the first year or two following her marriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did he say who you’re supposed to marry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. He wouldn’t tell Norah, either, although he seemed to enjoy letting her know she’s going to have six kids. Three boys and three girls, if you can believe it. You don’t really buy any of this, do you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth twisted into a wry grin. “That would be ridiculous, only… Never mind,” he finished abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, tell me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, clearly regretting that he’d said anything. “Another patient of mine, an older woman, had a near-death experience. It was all rather…strange.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She came back thinking she knew who her children would marry and how many grandchildren she was going to have?” Valerie asked sarcastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” Colby threw her an annoyed glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened then?” She was curious now, unable to disguise her interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She seemed to know certain things about the future. She—predicted, I guess is the word—certain political events. She wasn’t entirely sure how she knew, she just did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So what was that all about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColby obviously wasn’t comfortable outlining the details of his patient’s experience. “She didn’t have any more than an eighth-grade education, and she’d never taken much interest in history or politics. But after that near-death phenomenon, she was suddenly able to discuss complicated world problems with genuine insight and skill. She didn’t understand it herself, and I didn’t have any medical explanation to offer her. The whole thing was as much a mystery to me as it was to her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil then, Valerie had to admit, she’d found her father’s experience somewhat…entertaining. She’d been willing to tolerate it, since whatever had happened had been very real to David. This “dreamtime” with her mother had given his life a new purpose, and she was grateful for that, if nothing else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you saying?” she asked Colby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t actually know.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/orchard-valley-grooms-orchard-valley-0/page-12.html","bookId":1979,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:05 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:05 AM"}
