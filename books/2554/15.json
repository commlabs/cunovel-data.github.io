Senator James McCready had died last year but his foundation lived on. Part of the building was rented office space - mostly to the private practices of the physicians associated with the foundation - but the rest was devoted to research.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that totally bothered Dawn. Dr. Heinze was a pediatric surgeon - it still bothered her that Mr. Osala had called in a surgeon - associated with a medical research facility. Were they doing research on her baby? Were his birth defects so unusual that he had to be hidden away and studied?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t care about his defects, she wanted him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut where was he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t named him, and he certainly wouldn\u0027t be listed anywhere with her last name. Baby Boy Pickering. Totally unlikely. But he had to be somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBanned from the building, she\u0027d had to set up watch out here. Not an easy thing in midtown Manhattan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped out of the car - a used Volvo V70 wagon - and stretched her legs. Jack had helped her buy it. She glanced through the side window into the rear where the infant seat was securely strapped in. She\u0027d wanted a Volvo because she\u0027d heard they were safe, and if she was going to be driving her baby around, she wanted a safe car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d parked where she could see not only the front entrance to the office section of the building but the ramps in and out of the attached garage as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was suddenly on alert as a silver Lexus pulled out of the garage. Dr. Heinze drove a silver Lexus -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yes, that was him behind the wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe jumped in and started the car. She\u0027d never before been able to follow him after he left his office. Now she\u0027d know exactly what he was up to. And, eventually, where he lived. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-15.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
