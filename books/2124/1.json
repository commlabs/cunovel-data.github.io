{"id":93792,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"\u003cp\u003eYou don\u0027t invite the local witch to parties. No matter how beautiful she is. That was the basic problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t care, Kaitlyn thought. I don\u0027t need anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was sitting in history class, listening to Marcy Huang and Pam Sasseen plan a party for that weekend. She couldn\u0027t help but hear them: Mr. Flynn\u0027s gentle, apologetic voice was no competition for their excited whispers. Kait was listening, pretending not to listen, and fiercely wishing she could get away. She couldn\u0027t, so she doodled on the blue-lined page of her history notebook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was full of contradictory feelings. She hated Pam and Marcy, and wanted them to die, or at least to have some gory accident that left them utterly broken and defeated and miserable. At the same time there was a terrible longing inside her. If they would only let her in-it wasn\u0027t as if she insisted on being the most popular, the most admired, girl at school. She\u0027d settle for a place in the group that was securely her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey could shake their heads and say, \"Oh, that Kaitlyn-she\u0027s odd, but what would we do without her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that would be fine, as long as she was a part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wouldn\u0027t happen, ever. Marcy would never think of inviting Kaitlyn to her party because she wouldn\u0027t think of doing something that had never been done before. No one ever invited the witch; no one thought that Kaitlyn, the lovely, spooky girl with the strange eyes, would want to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I don\u0027t care, Kaitlyn thought, her reflections coming around full circle. This is my last year. One semester to go. After that, I\u0027m out of high school and ? hope I never see anyone from this place again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that was the other problem, of course. In a little town like Thoroughfare she was bound to see them, and their parents, every day for the next year. And the year after that, and the year after that. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no escape. If she could have gone away to college, it might have been different. But she\u0027d screwed up her art scholarship . . . and anyway, there was her father. He needed her-and there wasn\u0027t any money. Dad needed her. It was junior college or nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe years stretched out in front of Kaitlyn, bleak as the Ohio winter outside the window, filled with endless cold classrooms. Endless sitting and listening to girls planning parties that she wasn\u0027t invited to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEndless exclusion. Endless aching and wishing that she were a witch so she could put the most hideous, painful, debilitating curse on all of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the while she was thinking, she was doodling. Or rather her hand was doodling-her brain didn\u0027t seem to be involved at all. Now she looked down and for the first time saw what she\u0027d drawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA spiderweb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what was strange was what was underneath the web, so close it was almost touching. A pair of eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWide, round, heavy-lashed eyes. Bambi eyes. The eyes of a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Kaitlyn stared at it, she suddenly felt dizzy, as if she were falling. As if the picture were opening to let her in. It was a horrible sensation-and a familiar one. It happened every time she drew one of those pictures, the kind they called her a witch for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kind that came true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled herself back with a jerk. There was a sick, sinking feeling inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, please, no, she thought. Not today-and not here, not at school. It\u0027s just a doodle; it doesn\u0027t mean anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease let it be just a doodle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she could feel her body bracing, ignoring her mind, going ice-cold in order to meet what was coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA child. She\u0027d drawn a child\u0027s eyes, so some child was in danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what child? Staring at the space under the eyes, Kait felt a tugging, almost a twitch, in her hand. Her fingers telling her the shape that needed to go there. Little half circle, with smaller curves at the edges. A snub nose. Large circle, filled in solid. A mouth, open in fear or surprise or pain. Big curve to indicate a round chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA series of long wriggles for hair-and then the itch, the urge, the need in Kait\u0027s hand ebbed away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let out her breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was all. The child in the picture must be a girl, with all that hair. Wavy hair. A pretty little girl with wavy hair and a spiderweb on top of her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was going to happen, involving a child and a spider. But where-and to what child? And when?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday? Next week? Next year?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt never was. That was the most terrible part of Kaitlyn\u0027s terrible gift. Her drawings were always accurate-they always, always came true. She always ended up seeing in real life what she\u0027d drawn on paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, what could she do? Run through town with a megaphone telling all kids to beware of spiders?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo down to the elementary school looking for girls with wavy hair?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if she tried to tell them, they\u0027d run away from her. As if Kaitlyn brought on the things she drew. As if she made them happen instead of just predicting them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lines of the picture were getting crooked. Kaitlyn blinked to straighten them. The one thing she wouldn\u0027t do was cry-because Kaitlyn never cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever. Not once, not since her mother had died when Kait was eight. Since then, Kait had learned how to make the tears go inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a disturbance at the front of the room. Mr. Flynn\u0027s voice, usually so soft and melodious that students could comfortably go to sleep to it, had stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris Barnable, a boy who worked sixth period as a student aide, had brought a piece of pink paper. A call slip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn watched Mr. Flynn take it, read it, then look mildly at the class, wrinkling his nose to push his glasses back up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kaitlyn, the office wants you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn was already reaching for her books. She kept her back very straight, her head very high, as she walked up the aisle to take the slip, kaitlyn fairchild to the principal\u0027s office-at once! it read. Somehow when the \"at once\" box was checked, the whole slip assumed an air of urgency and malice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In trouble again?\" a voice from the first row asked snidely. Kaitlyn couldn\u0027t tell who it was, and she wouldn\u0027t turn around to look. She went out the door with Chris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn trouble again, yes, she thought as she walked down the stairs to the main office. What did they have on her this time? Those excuses \"signed by her father\" last fall?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn missed a lot of school, because there were times when she just couldn\u0027t stand it. Whenever it got too bad, she went down Piqua Road to where the farms were, and drew. Nobody bothered her there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry you\u0027re in trouble,\" Chris Barnable said as they reached the office. \"I mean . . . I\u0027m sorry if you\u0027re in trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn glanced at him sharply. He was an okay-looking guy: shiny hair, soft eyes-a lot like Hello Sailor, the cocker spaniel she\u0027d had years ago. Still, she wasn\u0027t fooled for a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoys-boys were no good. Kait knew exactly why\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey were nice to her. She\u0027d inherited her mother\u0027s creamy Irish skin and autumn-fire hair. She\u0027d inherited her mother\u0027s supple, willow-slim figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut her eyes were her own, and just now she used them without mercy. She turned an icy gaze on Chris, looking at him in a way she was usually careful to avoid. She looked him straight in the face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was typical of the way people around here reacted when they had to meet Kaitlyn\u0027s eyes. No one else had eyes like Kaitlyn. They were smoky blue, and at the outside of each iris, as well as in the middle, were darker rings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer father said they were beautiful and that Kaitlyn had been marked by the fairies. But other people said other things. Ever since she could remember, Kaitlyn had heard the whispers-that she had strange eyes, evil eyes. Eyes that saw what wasn\u0027t meant to be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, like now, Kaitlyn used them as a weapon. She stared at Chris Barnable until the poor jerk actually stepped backward. Then she lowered her lashes demurely and walked into the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt gave her only a sick, momentary feeling of triumph. Scaring cocker spaniels was hardly an achievement. But Kaitlyn was too frightened and miserable herself to care. A secretary waved her toward the principal\u0027s office, and Kaitlyn steeled herself. She opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMs. McCasslan, the principal, was there-but she wasn\u0027t alone. Sitting beside the desk was a tanned, trim young woman with short blond hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Congratulations,\" the blond woman said, coming out of the chair with one quick, graceful movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn stood motionless, head high. She didn\u0027t know what to think. But all at once she had a rush of feeling, like a premonition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is it. What you\u0027ve been waiting for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t known she was waiting for anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course you have. And this is it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next few minutes are going to change your life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Joyce,\" the blond woman said. \"Joyce Piper. Don\u0027t you remember me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman did seem familiar. Her sleek blond hair clung to her head like a wet seal\u0027s fur, and her eyes were a startling aquamarine. She was wearing a smart rose-colored suit, but she moved like an aerobics teacher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMemory burst on Kaitlyn. \"The vision screening!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoyce nodded. \"Exactly!\" she said energetically. \"Now, how much do you remember about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBewildered, Kaitlyn looked at Ms. McCasslan. The principal, a small woman, quite plump and very pretty, was sitting with her hands folded on the desk. She seemed serene, but her eyes were sparkling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right, so I\u0027m not in trouble, Kait thought. But what\u0027s going on? She stood uncertainly in the center of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be frightened, Kaitlyn,\" the principal said. She waved a small hand with a number of rings on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKait sat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t bite,\" Joyce added, sitting down herself, although she kept her aquamarine eyes on Kait\u0027s face the entire time. \"Now, what do you remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was just a test, like you get at the optometrist\u0027s,\" Kaitlyn said slowly. \"I thought it was some new program.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone brought their new programs to Ohio. Ohio was so representative of the nation that its people were perfect guinea pigs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoyce was smiling a little. \"It was a new program. But we weren\u0027t screening for vision, exactly. Do you remember the test where you had to write down the letters you saw?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh-yes.\" It wasn\u0027t easy to remember, because everything that had happened during the testing was vague. It had been last fall, early October, Kait thought. Joyce had come into study hall and talked to the class. That was clear enough-Kait remembered her asking them to cooperate. Then Joyce had guided them through some \"relaxation exercises\"-after which Kaitlyn had been so relaxed that everything was foggy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gave everybody a pencil and a piece of paper,\" she said hesitantly to Joyce. \"And then you projected letters on the movie screen. And they kept getting smaller and smaller. I could hardly write,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe added. \"I was limp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a little hypnosis to get past your inhibitions,\" Joyce said, leaning forward. \"What else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I kept writing letters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you did,\" Joyce said. A slight grin flashed in her tanned face. \"You did indeed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment, Kaitlyn said, \"So I\u0027ve got good eyesight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t know.\" Still grinning, Joyce straightened up. \"You want to know how that test really worked, Kaitlyn? We kept projecting the letters smaller and smaller-until finally they weren\u0027t there at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Weren\u0027t there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not for the last twenty frames. There were just dots, absolutely featureless. You could have vision like a hawk and still not make anything out of them.\" \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cold finger seemed to run up Kaitlyn\u0027s backbone. \"I saw letters,\" she insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you did. But not with your eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was perfect silence in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn\u0027s heart was beating hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We had someone in the room next door,\" Joyce said. \"A graduate student with very good concentration, and he was looking at charts with letters on them. That was why you saw letters, Kait. You saw through his eyes. You expected to see letters on the chart, so your mind was open-and you received what he saw.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn said faintly, \"It doesn\u0027t work that way.\" Oh, please, God ... all she needed was another power, another curse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It does; it\u0027s all the same,\" Joyce said. \"It\u0027s called remote viewing. The awareness of an event beyond the range of your ordinary senses. Your drawings are remote viewings of events-sometimes events that haven\u0027t happened yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you know about my drawings?\" A rush of emotion brought Kait to her feet. It wasn\u0027t fair: this stranger coming in and playing with her, testing her, tricking her-and now talking about her private drawings. Her very private drawings that people in Thoroughfare had the decency to only refer to obliquely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you what I know,\" Joyce said. Her voice was soft, rhythmic, and she was gazing at Kaitlyn intently with those aquamarine eyes. \"I know that you first discovered your gift when you were nine years old. A little boy from your neighborhood had disappeared-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Danny Lindenmayer,\" the principal put in briskly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Danny Lindenmayer had disappeared,\" Joyce said, without looking away from Kait. \"And the police were going door to door, looking for him. You were drawing with crayons while they talked to your father. You heard everything about the missing boy. And when you were done drawing, it was a picture you didn\u0027t understand, a picture of trees and a bridge . . . and something square.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn nodded, feeling oddly defeated. The memory sucked at her, making her dizzy. That first picture, so dark and strange, and her own fear. .. She\u0027d known it was a very bad thing that her fingers had drawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she hadn\u0027t known why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the next day, on TV, you saw the place where they\u0027d found the little boy\u0027s body,\" Joyce said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Underneath a bridge by some trees ... in a packing crate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something square,\" Kaitlyn said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It matched the picture you\u0027d drawn exactly, even though there was no way you could have known about that place. The bridge was thirty miles away, in a town\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou\u0027d never been to. When your father saw the news on TV, he recognized your picture, too-and he got excited. Started showing the drawing around, telling the story. But people reacted badly. They already thought you were a little different because of your eyes. But this-this was a whole lot different. They didn\u0027t like it. And when it happened again, and again, when your drawings kept coming true, they got very frightened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Kaitlyn developed something of an attitude problem,\" the principal interjected delicately. \"She\u0027s*,, naturally rebellious and a bit high-strung-like a colt. But she got prickly, too, and cool. Self-defense.\" She made tsking noises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn glared, but it was a feeble glare. Joyce\u0027s quiet, sympathetic voice had disarmed her. She sat down again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you know all about me,\" she said to Joyce. \"So I\u0027ve got an attitude problem. So wh-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do not have an attitude problem,\" Joyce interrupted. She looked almost shocked. She leaned forward, speaking very earnestly. \"You have a gift, a very great gift. Kaitlyn, don\u0027t you understand? Don\u0027t you realize how unusual you are, how wonderful?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Kaitlyn\u0027s experience, unusual did not equate to wonderful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the entire world, there are only a handful of people who can do what you can do,\" Joyce said. \"In the entire United States, we only found five.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five high school seniors. Five kids like you. All with different talents, of course; none of you can do the same thing. But that\u0027s great; that\u0027s just what we\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere looking for. We\u0027ll be able to do a variety of experiments.\" .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to experiment on me?\" Kaitlyn looked at the principal in alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m getting ahead of myself. Let me explain. I\u0027m from San Carlos, California-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, that explained the tan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"-and I work for the Zetes Institute. It\u0027s a very small laboratory, not at all like SRI or Duke University. It was established last year by a research grant from the Zetes Foundation. Mr. Zetes is-oh, how can I explain him? He\u0027s an incredible man-he\u0027s the chairman of a big corporation in Silicon Valley. But his real interest is in psychic phenomena. Psychic research.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoyce paused and pushed sleek blond hair off her forehead. Kaitlyn could feel her working up to something big. \"He\u0027s put up the funds for a very special project, a very intense project. It was his idea to do screening at high schools all over the country, looking for seniors with high psychic potential. To find the five or six that were absolutely the top, the cream of the crop, and to bring them to California for a year of testing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A year?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the beauty of it, don\u0027t you see? Instead of doing a few sporadic tests, we\u0027d do testing daily, on a regular schedule. We\u0027d be able to chart changes in your powers with your biorhythms, with your diet-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoyce broke off abruptly. Looking at Kait directly, she reached out and took Kait\u0027s hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kaitlyn, let down the walls and just listen to me for a minute. Can you do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKait could feel her hands trembling in the cool grasp of the blond woman\u0027s fingers. She swallowed, unable to look away from those aquamarine eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kaitlyn, I am not here to hurt you. I admire you tremendously. You have a wonderful gift. I want to study it-I\u0027ve spent my life preparing to study it. I went to college at Duke-you know, where Rhine did his telepathy experiments. I got my master\u0027s degree in parapsychology-I\u0027ve worked at the Dream Laboratory at Maimonides, and the Mind Science Foundation in San Antonio, and the Engineering Anomalies Research Laboratory at Princeton. And all I\u0027ve ever wanted is a subject like you. Together we can prove that what you do is real. We can get hard, replicable, scientific proof. We can show the world that ESP exists.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped, and Kaitlyn heard the whir of a copier in the outer office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are some benefits for Kaitlyn, too,\" Ms. McCasslan said. \"I think you should explain the terms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes.\" Joyce let go of Kaitlyn\u0027s hands and picked up a manila folder from the desk. \"You\u0027ll go to a very good school in San Carlos to finish up your senior year. Meanwhile you\u0027ll be living at the Institute with the four other students we\u0027ve chosen. We\u0027ll do testing every afternoon, but it won\u0027t take long-just an hour or two a day. And at the end of a year, you\u0027ll receive a scholarship to the college of your choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoyce opened the folder and handed it to Kaitlyn. \"A very generous scholarship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A very generous scholarship,\" Ms. McCasslan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn found herself looking at a number on a piece of paper. \"That\u0027s . . . for all of us, to split?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is for you,\" Joyce said. \"Alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn felt dizzy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be helping the cause of science,\" Joyce said. \"And you could make a new life for yourself. A new start. No one at your new school needs to know why you\u0027re there; you can just be an ordinary high school kid. Next fall you can go to Stanford or San Francisco State University-San Carlos is just half an hour south of San Francisco. And after that, you\u0027re free. You can go anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn felt really dizzy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll love the Bay Area. Sunshine, nice beaches- do you realize it was seventy degrees there yesterday when I left? Seventy degrees in winter. Redwoods- palm trees-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t,\" Kaitlyn said weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoyce and the principal both looked at her, startled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t,\" Kait said again, more loudly, pulling her walls close around her. She needed the walls, or she might succumb to the shimmering picture Joyce was painting in her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you want to get away?\" Joyce said gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDidn\u0027t she? Only so much that she sometimes felt like a bird beating its wings against glass. Except that she\u0027d never been quite sure what she\u0027d do once she got away. She\u0027d just thought, There must be some place I belong. A place where I\u0027d just fit in, without trying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d never thought of California as being the place. California was almost too rich, too heady and exciting. It was like a dream. And the money . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t understand. It\u0027s my dad. I\u0027ve never been away from him, not since my mom died, and he needs me. He\u0027s not... He really needs me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMs. McCasslan was looking sympathetic. Ms. McCasslan knew her dad, of course. He\u0027d been brilliant, a philosophy professor; he\u0027d written books. But after Kaitlyn\u0027s mother had died, he\u0027d gotten ... vague.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he sang a lot to himself and did odd jobs around town. He didn\u0027t make much doing them. When bills came in, he shuffled his feet and ruffled his hair, looking anxious and ashamed. He was almost like a kid-but he adored Kait and she adored him. She would never let anything hurt him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd to leave him so soon, before she was even old enough to go to college-and to go all the way to California-and for a year-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s impossible,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMs. McCasslan was looking down at her plump hands. \"But, Kaitlyn, don\u0027t you think he\u0027d want you to go? To do what\u0027s best for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn shook her head. She didn\u0027t want to listen to arguments. Her mind was made up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t you like to learn to control your talents?\" Joyce said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn looked at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe possibility of control had never occurred to her. The pictures came when she wasn\u0027t expecting them; took over her hand without her realizing it. She never knew what had happened until it was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you can learn,\" Joyce said. \"I think you and I could learn, together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaitlyn opened her mouth, but before she could answer, there was a terrible sound from outside the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a crashing and a grinding and a shattering all together. And it was a huge noise, so huge that Kaitlyn knew at once it could come from nothing ordinary. It sounded very close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoyce and Ms. McCasslan had both jumped up, and it was the plump little principal who made it to the door first. She rushed out through the office to the street, with Kait and Joyce following her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople were running up on either side of Harding Street, crunching through the snow. Cold air bit Kaitlyn\u0027s cheeks. The slanting afternoon sunlight threw up sharp contrasts between light and shadow, making the scene in front of Kaitlyn look frighteningly focused and distinct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA yellow Neon was facing the wrong way on Harding Street, its back wheels on the sidewalk, its left side a wreck. It looked as if it had been broadsided and spun. Kaitlyn recognized it; it belonged to Jerry Crutchfield, one of the few students who had a car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the middle of the street, a dark blue station wagon was facing Kaitlyn directly. Its entire front end was accordioned. The metal was twisted and deformed, the headlights shattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolly Vertanen, a junior, was tugging at Ms. McCasslan\u0027s sleeve. \"I saw everything, Ms. McCasslan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerry just pulled out of the parking lot- but the station wagon was going too fast. They just hit him. ... I saw everything. They were going too fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s Marian Gunter\u0027s station wagon,\" Ms. McCasslan said sharply. \"That\u0027s her little girl in there. Don\u0027t move her yet! Don\u0027t move her!\" The principal\u0027s voice went on, but Kait didn\u0027t hear any more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was staring at the windshield of the station wagon. She hadn\u0027t seen before-but she could see now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople around her were yelling, running. Kaitlyn hardly noticed them. Her entire world was filled with the car windshield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little girl had been thrown up against it-or maybe it had crunched back up against her. She was actually lying with her forehead touching the glass, as if she were looking out with open eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith wide eyes. Wide, round, heavy-lashed eyes. Bambi eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a small snub nose and a round chin. Wavy blond hair stuck to the glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glass itself was shattered like a spiderweb, a spiderweb superimposed on the child\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no-please, no ...\" Kaitlyn whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found herself clutching, without knowing what she was clutching at. Somebody steadied her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSirens were wailing closer. A crowd was gathering around the station wagon, blocking Kaitlyn\u0027s view of the child. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-strange-power-dark-visions-1/page-1.html","bookId":2124,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:04:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:04:44 PM"}
