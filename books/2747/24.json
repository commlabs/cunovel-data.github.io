So far, neither Zach nor I had said much of anything, because A) When we got downstairs there was a huge group of people waiting to walk to town (one of whom was Tina Walters). B) The wind was blowing, so I had to keep my head at a weird angle to keep my hair out of my face. And C) Even though I\u0027d been on dates (and missions) before, I\u0027d never done both at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd finally, it\u0027s kind of hard to talk when you walk two miles only to find yourself in the middle of the Roseville, Virginia, Founders\u0027 Day parade. Yes, I said parade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth the spy and the girl in me knew I was supposed to be saying something—I was supposed to be doing something—but as soon as we turned onto Main Street I heard the blare of trumpets from the Pride of Roseville Marching Band; I saw church ladies selling brownies and raffle tickets for a chance to win a homemade quilt. The entire town of Roseville seemed to be either marching down the streets or filling the square.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He looks good, Cam … I mean Chameleon,\" Liz hurried to correct her mistake. I glanced up and down the crowded streets and couldn\u0027t see my roommates anywhere, but there was some comfort in knowing they were there. \"Cough if you think he looks good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e10:41 hours: The Operative couldn\u0027t help but notice that The Subject both looked and smelled REALLY good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach did look good. He wasn\u0027t in his uniform. He\u0027d put something in his hair so that it was messed up in all the right places. And I kept thinking that there had to be something nefarious going on—that there was no way this boy was on a real date with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Chameleon, you know you can talk,\" Macey said through the comms units. \"It is allowed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut talking wasn\u0027t exactly easy, because I was with Zach…On a date-slash-honeypotting mission! I had a comms unit in my ear and a package of breath mints in my purse, and there was a 1/187 chance I would see my ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend. … I was dealing with a lot of issues!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to do something?\" I asked awkwardly, even though, technically, we were doing something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could go to a movie,\" Zach said. \"Or get something to eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or we could just…walk,\" he suggested, and for the first time I wondered if he might be nervous, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or we could have that clown over there paint our faces and then go rob the bank,\" he suggested, as if I wasn\u0027t really listening. But I didn\u0027t fall for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way. Last October they installed a Stockholm Series 360—it\u0027d take us at least forty-five minutes to crack it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good to know.\" He laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly I wanted to stop in the middle of the street and ask Zach why he\u0027d asked me out. I wanted him to confess that I was being honeypotted too. But when Zach reached for my hand and led me through crowded sidewalks, it didn\u0027t feel like the gesture of an operative on a mission. And then, more than anything, I wanted to stop hearing Macey\u0027s words, It\u0027s okay for you to like him, because sometimes not liking someone is easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA middle-aged man in a red jacket lingered in the center of the square. Antique cars lined the street while men with big bellies kicked the tires and sipped lemonade. We were only two miles away from school, but the Roseville town square felt like another world. The most dangerous thing I could see was a crowd of little girls in sparkly leotards pushing their way down the sidewalk. Zach pulled me around a corner and onto a quiet side street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, plant any good bugs lately?\" Zach asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA spark was in his eyes, but I couldn\u0027t laugh. I couldn\u0027t even speak. The silence pulsed between us like the beat of the retreating band.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just so you know, Gallagher Girl,\" he whispered softly, \"I\u0027m going to kiss you now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time in months I wasn\u0027t thinking about my mission or my cover or my friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands were warm on the back of my neck; his fingers laced through my hair, and he tilted his head as he moved in. I closed my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I heard, \"Oh my gosh! Cammie, is that you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach said a really bad word as he inched away from me. (But I doubt DeeDee noticed, because the bad word was in Farsi.) The noise coming from the square seemed louder than it had just seconds before, and I knew that whatever trance I\u0027d been in was completely broken—the moment was totally over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach had started to kiss me. I had almost let Zach kiss me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Cammie,\" DeeDee said. She hugged me and smiled at Zach. \"I\u0027m so glad you two are here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh stood five feet away, staring at me, but he didn\u0027t say hi. I\u0027ve thrown enough punches in my life to know when someone is hurting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped away from Zach as if I could make Josh forget what he\u0027d just seen, but then I noticed the reflection in the window behind me—Josh\u0027s reflection—and I knew that Zach must have seen him. Immediately, my mind raced with a thousand questions—was that why Zach had tried to kiss me? Why did Josh look so sad?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no fewer than twenty things I simply had to ask Macey McHenry! I started scanning the crowds, looking for my friends, but instead I saw a man across the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn ordinary man. I\u0027d seen him buying brownies and looking under the hood of a Model T.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no one on the street was talking to him, and his shoes were too dressy for a parade. I remembered what my father used to say about counter surveillance: Once is a stranger; twice is a coincidence; three times is a tail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this made time number three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the four of us started down the sidewalk, I couldn\u0027t shake the feeling that I needed backup for an entirely different reason. Josh and DeeDee walked a few steps ahead, so I whispered to Zach, \"Hey, you\u0027re gonna think I\u0027m crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little late for that, Gallagher Girl.\" At the word Gallagher, two women on the sidewalk turned to give us the Gallagher Glare, but I didn\u0027t have time to worry about my school\u0027s reputation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t seen anyone following us, have you?\" I asked. Zach laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean besides your roommates?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes. \"Yeah. Besides them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I haven\u0027t seen anyone on our tail. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The guy. The blue jacket.\" DeeDee glanced back at me, so I altered my words. \"Don\u0027t you think he\u0027s toasty in that heavy coat?\" which is spy-slang for an operative who is about to get caught, but DeeDee didn\u0027t know that. Luckily, Zach did. He turned, casually taking in everything from the sight of the convertibles carrying the Founders\u0027 Day Princess and her court to the way DeeDee said hi to almost everyone we passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about him?\" Zach asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The jacket\u0027s reversible. Ten minutes ago he was wearing it the other way. Do you think a lot of regular guys in Roseville take the time to reverse their jackets?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stopped to look in a store window\u0027s wavy reflection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at that guy, Gallagher Girl,\" Zach whispered as the man bought a corn dog. \"He\u0027s a mustard disaster looking for a place to happen. I bet you anything he\u0027s got a big stain on the other side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sounded like a good point—it felt like a good point, but then Zach laughed, and something…was strange. I knew it wasn\u0027t paranoia. I knew it was bigger than me and bigger than Roseville and bigger than any parade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now what are you two chatting about?\" DeeDee teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Cammie was trying to convince me that I should recognize that guy in the blue jacket.\" Zach looked at me, and I knew the words were for me—not Dee Dee—as he said, \"But I\u0027ve never seen him before in my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it would have been good news. I may have relaxed. But then I looked down at the ring I was wearing, felt the subtle vibration, and knew that he was lying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not exactly proud of what came next, but Mr. Solomon himself has told me that spies do bad things for good reasons, so I smiled, I gripped DeeDee\u0027s arm, and I used that unsuspecting girl for cover as I announced, \"I\u0027ve got to go to the bathroom!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll walk with you,\" Zach started, but I didn\u0027t let him finish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said, smiling at DeeDee. \"It\u0027s a girl thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we pulled away from Josh and Zach, DeeDee giggled and wrapped her thin arm in mine. It probably seemed like fun to her—two girls setting off on their own down the crowded sidewalks. But I was entrenched in another kind of adventure as I scanned the crowds, looking for friends and enemies on the bustling square.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can go to the pharmacy,\" DeeDee yelled over the roaring siren of a passing fire truck covered with cheerleaders—the end of the parade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The pharmacy has bathrooms,\" she said again, and I nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, we\u0027ll go to the pharmacy,\" I repeated loudly, hoping my friends would hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething was wrong—Zach was lying, and a man I\u0027d never seen was stalking Gallagher Girls in Roseville. And that\u0027s the kind of thing that never happened before the Blackthorne Boys came to the Gallagher Academy and brought a Code Black with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, Cammie, I\u0027m really glad I ran into you,\" DeeDee said, as if I had time for girl talk. \"I was wondering if things are…you know…serious? With you and Zach? You guys seem happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite everything, I stopped and turned to her. Was I happy with Zach? Could I ever be happy with Zach? Two minutes before I might have had a different answer to that question, but in a spy\u0027s life, two minutes is all it takes for the whole world to change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cammie!\" Bex was rushing toward me, waving. \"Oh,\" she said with a quick glance at DeeDee. \"Hi.\" Then she looked at me and rolled her eyes. \"I just got a call on my cell phone,\" she lied. \"We\u0027ve got to go back to school.\" She sounded disappointed—annoyed. Nothing in her tone reflected any of the panic I felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked back at DeeDee. \"Sorry,\" I said, already stepping away. \"I\u0027ve got to—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" DeeDee said, but her usually bright smile seemed to fade. \"Cammie,\" she called just as I started to turn, \"I really hope you and Zach are happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny other day I might have pondered that sentence for hours, dissected it with Macey, searched for hidden meaning in the words. Was that DeeDee\u0027s way of telling me that she and Josh weren\u0027t happy? Was I a threat to their seemingly perfect love? Or was DeeDee just the kind of person who wanted everyone to be as happy as she was?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I\u0027d been a normal girl I might have replayed every second of that day—my almost-kiss, the hurt look on Josh\u0027s face. But I wasn\u0027t a normal girl. As Zach himself had reminded me time and time again … I was a Gallagher Girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We had two guys on us, too,\" Bex said as she fell into step beside me. I stopped in the street and turned to check behind us, but she rolled her eyes. \"I said had.\" She shook her head. \"I knew we couldn\u0027t trust boys who keep their rooms that clean. It\u0027s not natural!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiz was a half-step behind her, already out of breath. I looked around. \"Where\u0027s Macey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Telling as many girls as she can find about the tails,\" Bex answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait! Cammie,\" Liz panted, \"you can\u0027t just leave in the middle of your date! What if Zach gets worried about you? What if he thinks you\u0027ve been kidnapped?\" Then she gasped. \"What if he thinks you don\u0027t like him?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cross-my-heart-and-hope-to-spy-gallagher-girls-2/page-24.html","bookId":2747,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:49:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:49:29 PM"}
