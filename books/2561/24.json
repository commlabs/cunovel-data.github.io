{"id":112203,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"\u003cp\u003eAs I drove towards Siobhan\u0027s house my nervousness and uncertainty increased. Despite all that I had seen in the last hour or so, a part of me still wondered whether I was to blame for the wall which seemed to have been built between the two of us. Had something I\u0027d done offended her? Had I missed or forgotten something crucial? Should I have called yesterday or just swallowed my pride and gone round to see her the day before? Would she even let me in the house when I turned up today? I couldn\u0027t believe that in less than half a week all that we had managed to build together through months of intimate closeness seemed to have been destroyed. I hoped and prayed that when I knocked on the door it would be answered by my Siobhan\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the girl that I loved, remembered and missed desperately. The girl who had saved my sanity. The one and only person who had always been there for me since Mum and Dad had died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiobhan\u0027s house wasn\u0027t far from mine and it didn\u0027t take me long to get there. The roads were quiet. I hadn\u0027t been expecting to come across much traffic, but I hardly saw any. I could only have passed another five or six cars during the entire journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned into her road and pulled up outside her house. For a couple of minutes I did nothing but just sit there and try and compose myself and get my thoughts together. All of the fear and concern I felt for the rest of the people around me paled into insignificance alongside my desperate fears and concerns for Siobhan. Whatever it was that was happening in Thatcham, I knew that I could deal with it with a thousand times more strength and determination if the woman I loved was standing by my side again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was no good. I didn\u0027t matter how hard I tried, I couldn\u0027t stop myself trembling and shaking with nervous anticipation. I stared at Siobhan\u0027s house and anxiously watched for even the slightest sign of movement. I had hoped that she might come out to see me when she saw the car but no, there was nothing. My tension was increasing with every second. All that I wanted to do was hold her tight again, but I couldn\u0027t bring myself to take that first step forward. The fear of being rejected by her was too much to even begin to think about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo or three long and painfully drawn-out minutes went by before I decided that I couldn\u0027t wait any longer. I took a long, deep breath and then got out of the car and walked up the short garden path to the front door. I closed my eyes and rang the bell. I peered through the small frosted glass window, hopeful of seeing some movement inside the house and quickly moved out of the way when I saw that someone was coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiobhan yanked the door open and stood and glared at me. She looked bad. Her clothes were creased and worn. She wasn\u0027t wearing any make-up and her usually perfect hair was knotted and tangled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Siobhan, I...\u0027 I began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slammed the door shut in my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStunned at first, I shook my head with disbelief. Then, more out of anger than for any other reason, I began to pound my fist against the door again and again and again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Siobhan!\u0027 I yelled, loud enough for the entire street to hear. \u0027Let me in! Just open the fucking door and let me talk to you!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI peered in through the small window again. I could see her waiting in the shadows of the hallway. That was a good sign. At least she was considering coming back and talking to me. If she hadn\u0027t wanted to know she would surely have gone further into the house. As it was she was still just a few feet away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Come on,\u0027 I begged. \u0027Please Siobhan, just stop and tell me why you\u0027re acting like this. If it\u0027s something I\u0027ve done then at least have the decency to tell me what it is. I\u0027m worried about you...\u0027 I glanced back over my shoulder self-consciously and wondered if anyone else in the road had heard me shouting. Not that it really seemed to matter\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;shouts, screams and arguments were par for the course today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You don\u0027t care about me,\u0027 a muffled voice suddenly grunted from inside the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes I do,\u0027 I insisted, relieved that she had finally spoken. \u0027Of course I do. I love you for God\u0027s sake. What makes you think that I don\u0027t care?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI braced myself for her response. I had asked a question that I didn\u0027t really want to hear the answer to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another long and painful silence. I squinted through the window again and saw that she had moved a little closer to the door. I quickly moved back out of the way, hoping that she hadn\u0027t seen me staring. To my relief I then heard the latch click. The door slowly opened inwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Thanks,\u0027 I gasped, my heart racing. \u0027I can\u0027t tell you how worried about you I\u0027ve been. I was starting to think that...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy words were wasted. Siobhan obviously didn\u0027t have any interest in what I had to say. Rather than listen she just turned her back and walked towards the living room. I followed but kept a cautious distance between us. The building was cold (I could see through the kitchen that the back door was open) and untidy. The carpets were covered with discarded food, clothes and belongings. She\u0027d never been particularly house proud, but I\u0027d never seen the place like this before. Siobhan stumbled and tripped across the littered living room floor and dropped heavily into the nearest seat. I waited by the door, unsure if I was welcome. When she didn\u0027t react I took a few hesitant steps forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I missed you,\u0027 I said, simply and honestly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe just stared into space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Are you okay?\u0027 I asked when she didn\u0027t respond. What a fucking stupid question\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;of course she wasn\u0027t okay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe mumbled something, but I couldn\u0027t make out what it was she\u0027d said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Pardon?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Leave me alone,\u0027 she said, this time a little louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What?\u0027 I sighed with tears welling up in my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I said leave me alone,\u0027 she repeated again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But why? Christ, what is it I\u0027m supposed to have done...?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I don\u0027t want you here. I don\u0027t need you anymore. I don\u0027t want to see you again.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer vicious words were spoken without emotion in a dull, low and cold tone. Her voice was monotonous and lifeless and it seemed to be a struggle for her just to open her mouth and speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But after everything we\u0027ve been though...?\u0027 I pleaded. \u0027You can\u0027t just turn your back on me without any reason. Have you got any idea how much you mean to me?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Just go.\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s the fucking matter with you?!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Nothing.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027s happened, Siobhan?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Go.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer orders were ruthless and final. There wasn\u0027t even the slightest hint of remorse in her brutal words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Okay,\u0027 I said quietly with tears of frustration now rolling freely down my face. \u0027If that\u0027s what you want...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and slowly walked back towards the door, feeling that I should turn around and try and reason with her again but knowing that it would be pointless while she was in this desperate state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood in the hallway for a second before relenting and allowing myself to turn back. The woman I loved\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the perfect creature to whom I had been ready to dedicate my life and soul\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;sat motionless, slumped forward in her chair with her head hanging down heavily. She stared at the floor just in front of her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cleared my throat and wiped my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ll come back soon,\u0027 I said, doing my level best to sound strong and composed but failing miserably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiobhan grunted something unintelligible but still didn\u0027t look up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tripped and stumbled through the house and stepped back out into the cold autumn air. I made sure that the latch had dropped and the door was secure before walking back towards my car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the same way that I had found it necessary to try and compose myself before I\u0027d seen Siobhan, I now needed to stop and steady my shattered nerves again. Seeing her in such a desperate state had torn me apart, and the lack of any explanation made her condition all the more difficult to accept. I gave up trying to work things out. There was little to be gained from searching aimlessly for ways to try and rationalise the completely irrational.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy options were becoming increasingly limited. I could go back to my empty house or I could try another friend. Clare was next on the list. I had no idea where Rob had gone earlier and so she seemed like the best person to try. With her elderly mother still away and her bastard ex-husband providing no support whatsoever, I knew that she too would have few people to turn to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe temperature seemed to have plummeted in the short time I had been with Siobhan. I zipped up my jacket and looked around. The world was still. Nothing moved. An overwhelming silence had descended everywhere. There was a definite and unexpected air of finality and resignation in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I drove away I allowed myself one last long look at Siobhan\u0027s house, hoping that I would see her. Just a moment of movement would be enough. Just to know that she still cared enough to drag herself out of her seat to see me would have made all the difference to my mood and resolve. But there was nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made a silent promise to myself to get back to her as soon as I could. As soon as I had found someone who could make sense of the madness of this morning I would drive straight back to the house and make her talk to me. I\u0027d do whatever I had to. If I ended up knocking her out cold and dragging her back to my car then I would. There was no way I was going to leave her. I couldn\u0027t stand the thought of leaving her alone but I knew that for now I didn\u0027t have a choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFighting hard to keep my concentration, I drove towards Clare\u0027s house. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trust/page-24.html","bookId":2561,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:57:51 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:57:51 AM"}
