Okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay. We still have to figure out food,” I said, licking my way around the cone so it wouldn’t drip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We could always get Con to grill some chicken,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah said with a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s going to be your best man. He can’t be sweating over the grill.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was kidding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you ask him yet? To be your best man?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not yet. I will, though.” He leaned down and took a bite of my ice cream. He got some on his upper lip, like a milk mustache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bit the insides of my cheeks to keep from smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s so funny?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we got back to the house, Conrad was watching TV in the living room. When we sat down on the couch, he got up. “I’m gonna hit the sack,” he said, stretching his arms over his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s, like, ten o’clock. Watch a movie with us,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nah, I’m gonna get up early tomorrow and surf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWanna join me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah glanced at me before saying, “Yeah, sounds good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought we were gonna work on the guest list in the morning,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll come back before you’re even awake. Don’t worry.” To Conrad, he said, “Knock on my door when you’re up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad hesitated. “I don’t want to wake up Belly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel myself blush. “I don’t mind,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Jeremiah and I had become boyfriend and girlfriend, we’d only been at the summer house together once. That time, I slept in his room with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe watched TV until he fell asleep, because he liked to sleep with the television on in the background. I couldn’t fall asleep like that, so I waited until he did and then I turned it off. It felt kind of strange, sleeping in his bed when mine was just down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt college we slept in the same bed all the time, and that felt normal. But here at the summer house I just wanted to sleep in my own room, in my own bed. It was familiar to me. It made me feel like a little girl still on vacation with her whole family. My paper-thin sheets with the faded yellow rosebuds, my cherry wood dresser and vanity. I used to have two white twin beds, but Susannah got rid of them and put in what she’d called a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“big girl bed.” I loved that bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad went upstairs, and I waited until I heard his bedroom door shut before I said, “Maybe I’ll sleep in my room tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” Jeremiah asked. “I promise I’ll be quiet when I get up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarefully, I asked, “Aren’t the bride and groom supposed to sleep in different beds before the wedding?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, but that’s the night before the wedding. Not every night before the wedding.” He looked hurt for a second, and then he said in his joking way, “Come on, you know I won’t touch you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though I knew he was only kidding, it still stung a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not that. Sleeping in my own room makes me feel… normal. It’s—it’s different than at school. At school, sleeping with you next to me feels normal. But here I like remembering what it used to feel like.” I searched his face to see if any of the hurt was still there. “Does that make sense at all?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess.” Jeremiah looked unconvinced, and I started to wish I’d never brought it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scooted closer to him, putting my feet in his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll have me next to you every night for the rest of our lives.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I guess that’ll be plenty,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey!” I said, kicking out my leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah just smiled and put a pillow over my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he changed the channel and we watched TV without saying anything more about it. When it was time to go to bed, he went to his room, and I went to mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slept better than I had in what felt like a really long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e144 · jenny han\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-eight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked Jere if he wanted to surf because I wanted to get him alone so I could find out what the hell was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn’t talked to him since he made his grand announce-ment at the restaurant. But now that we were alone, I didn’t know what to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe bobbed on our surfboards, waiting for the next wave. It had been slow out there so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cleared my throat. “So how pissed is Laurel?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pissed,” Jere said, grimacing. “Belly and her had a pretty big fight yesterday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In front of you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit.” I wasn’t surprised, though. There was no way Laurel was going to be like, sure, I’ll throw my teenaged daughter a wedding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, pretty much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What does Dad say about all this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a funny look. “Since when do you care what Dad says?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked out toward the house. I hesitated before saying, “I don’t know. If Laurel’s against it and Dad’s against it, maybe you shouldn’t do it. I mean, you guys are still in college. You don’t even have a job. When you think about it, it’s kind of ridiculous.” My voice trailed off. Jere was shooting daggers at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay out of it, Conrad,” he said. He was practically spitting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right. Sorry. I didn’t mean to … I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never asked for your opinion. This is between me and Belly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, “You’re right. Forget it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah didn’t answer. He looked over his shoulder, and then he started to paddle away. As the wave crested, he popped up and rode it to shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI punched my hand through the water. I wanted to kick his ass. This is between me and Belly. Smug piece of shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was marrying my girl, and I couldn’t do anything about it. I just had to watch it happen, because he was my brother, because I promised. Take care of him, Connie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m counting on you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-nine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got up the next morning, the boys were still surfing, so I took my binder and my legal pad and a glass of milk out to the deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Taylor’s checklist, we had to get the guest list figured out before we could do anything else. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/we-ll-always-have-summer-summer-3/page-26.html","bookId":2725,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:44 PM"}
