He thought briefly, \u0027Is this what it feels like to be a religious leader of a pseudo-religion?\u0027. If the God who made him into a skeleton was to see this scene, her blood pressure would rise and would feel unsteady.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0027In any case, I have to finish it before it recovers its mana.

This situational decision making was an ability that he always had.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Kuek, Kuheeeeek...!]\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How long did that gruesome battle go on? Through one of the Skeleton Warrior\u0027s brilliant sacrifice, Lee Shin Woo blocked the Treasure Eater\u0027s attack and forcefully struck with his sword. The moment he cleaved its rotten belly, the Treasure Eater coughed intensely and spewed out a blood clot.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Now, guys!

Lee Shin Woo bobbed his hand, sending the signal, and the Skeleton Warriors simultaneously charged at the Treasure Eater. The Treasure Eater had become a mess and one by one, the Skeleton Warriors\u0027 swords lodged deep into its flesh.\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Kuhek, Kueeeeek...!]\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Treasure Eater spat out another clot of blood and was in pain.
