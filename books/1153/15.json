HOW THE COCKEREL USED HIS SPURS.","content":"As the tilt which was now about to take place was merely a friendly display of knightly prowess, and \"for the honour of ladies and their delectation,\" the knights were to encounter with blunted lances and swords. The Marshal of the Lists having examined the arms, all who were in the enclosure were ordered out, and the knights only awaited the signal to begin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Each knight was to ride three courses separately with his antagonist, and then three courses again afterwards.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was now a lull in the busy hum of conversation that had been going on in the large crowd. Every one was on tip-toe of expectation to see the two knights who were first to encounter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There they sat erect, a little in front of their comrades, their lances upright, the steel-clad figures stiff and immovable on their gorgeously-trapped horses. Not a movement could be seen in one or the other, only their pennons flickered in the light air, and the lambrequin or slashed cloth mantling of their helmets blew out from time to time.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As the names of the knights and esquires who were going to take part in the tilting had been affixed in the market-place of Newport, as well as on the gate of Carisbrooke Castle, for some days past, together with their coats-of-arms, the people all knew who was who.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s the sturdy Breton knight at that end, him in the white tabard, with the gold dragon on his breast,\" said a stout yeoman, who was one of a group of several men round a fair and buxom dame, whom Tom o\u0027 Kingston, being on duty, could only ogle from under his visor, and who was no other than the irresistible Polly Bremskete.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And who\u0027s that at the other end; he looks a tough wight?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What, him in the gold coat and a green lion with a forked tail? That\u0027s young Sir John Dudley, him as married Mistress Bremshott up to Gatcombe.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Marry! now who\u0027d have thought such a small man would have looked so big. \u0027Tis the armour surely--how it do swell them out.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hush! they\u0027re going to begin.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The trumpets gave a flourish. The Marshal, after a pause, called out in a loud voice,--\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Laissez aller!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At the first sound of the trumpet the two knights had brought their lances to the rest with a simultaneous and graceful sweep, causing the gay pennons to flash in the sun, they then remained motionless as before.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At the last word, they clapped spurs to their horses and rode straight for each other, bending their heads low down, leaning well forward, and covering themselves with their shields.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Lord! what a crack!\" cried Mistress Bremskete, in admiration.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He\u0027s off! he\u0027s off!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, that he bean\u0027t.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He was parlous nigh anyway! I lay a yard o\u0027 broadcloth he\u0027ll be off next bout. But \u0027twas well done, leastways: that\u0027s what I will say.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The two knights had met with a violent splintering of spears in the midst of the lists. The Breton seemed never to feel the shock at all, for he rode on, tossing away the broken handle of his lance, after waving it aloft in the air. But the English knight reeled in his saddle; only he recovered himself directly, and rode up to the other end of the lists, where he turned, reined in his horse, and waited for his esquire to bring him another lance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The trumpet sounded. The herald shouted,--\"Well done, noble knights; remember the brave deeds of your ancestors. The ladies\u0027 eyes are upon you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When the knights had received new lances, they once more awaited the signal. It soon came, and again the gleaming figures met in the rude shock. This time Sir John Dudley\u0027s lance struck the helmet of his opponent, and carried away the crest and part of the lambrequin, while the Breton knight\u0027s lance glanced off the ridged breast-plate, and, passing under the arm, the guard struck full against the cuirass of Sir John Dudley, and the two knights were both nearly unseated. Had they not been practised riders, and reined in their horses at the same moment, they must have fallen. As it was, they remained locked together for a moment, and so stood until the herald called out,--\"Enough! \u0027tis well done; unloose.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They then disengaged, and rode back to their own end of the lists, amid the shouts of applause of the populace, and the music of the trumpeters.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They are right skilful knights! I don\u0027t know as I ever saw better,\" said Tom o\u0027 Kingston to Humphrey, who stood near him holding a spare lance for his young master. \"But there they go again. Holy Thomas! but he\u0027s off; good lack, I am parlous grieved. I would it had been the other.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A groan and shout of applause mingled together, while a dull thud and clang of metal falling, announced that one of the knights had been thrown.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Marry, I am sorry \u0027tis poor young Sir John; and there\u0027s his wife looking on now! Well, \u0027tis a pity, to be sure,\" said Mistress Bremskete.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ay, but she takes it mighty comfortable anyway. See how she\u0027s laughing with the Lord Abbot of Quarr there.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well then she hadn\u0027t ought, that\u0027s what I say, Look! they\u0027re picking of him up. Alack, poor man, how he do bleed! \u0027Tis from the mouth, seemingly. Well-a-day! well-a-day! but \u0027twas a rude knock.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And so amid the plaudits of the crowd and the clarion blasts of the trumpets, the Breton knight returned to his end of the list, and took his station next the last of the challengers, receiving their congratulations as he rode up, while his luckless antagonist was helped out of the lists, to be attended to in the tent set aside for the reception of those wounded in the tilt.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The next knight who rode out from the challengers\u0027 end was Sir Amand de la Roche Guemen√©. As he took up his place, he turned towards Yolande and bowed low to his saddle-bow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why, he\u0027s wearing the same colours she\u0027s got on! Well, to be sure, that\u0027s a merry jest! Can\u0027t she find among all our island gentry one to her taste, but she must go giving away her favours to them jackanapes Frenchmen? But \u0027tis ever the way with your high-born wenches; they always goes after what\u0027s strange, never mind how ugly it be, if only it be something new. It all comes of so many running after them.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then, Mistress Bremskete, you ought to like those Breton gents, seeing the many suitors you have,\" said the ready yeoman by her side, with a knowing leer, giving his buxom companion a nudge with his elbow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Go along with ye, Master Paxhulle! you\u0027re always fooling us poor wenches with your soft tongue.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll have to trounce that Paxhulle, I see,\" said Tom o\u0027 Kingston savagely, to Humphrey, upon whom the merry glance of Mistress Bremskete, and the leer of her companion, were in no way lost.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I say, that\u0027s Sir John\u0027s nephew there. I do hope he\u0027ll do well! \u0027Tis a nice youth; but they\u0027re all too young, to my mind. These Breton knights have been well tried in many tilts, and are tough and skilled. But there they go! Good luck go with him--ah!--\u0027Twas well done! He\u0027s a brave youth.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After splintering their lances without any further damage, the two cavaliers cantered on to the end of the lists, wheeled round and faced each other, taking the fresh lances handed them by their esquires.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Whether it were that young Trenchard really bore himself with greater skill and address, or that his antagonist, out of knightly courtesy to the trusty friend of his host, the Captain of the Wight, forebore to use all his skill and strength, it happened that the three courses were ridden without any mishap beyond a plentiful splintering of lancewood, and a rending of knightly finery.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sir John Trenchard was evidently pleased, and accepted the congratulations of Lord Woodville and Mistress Lisle with but half-dissembled satisfaction.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"\u0027Tis a good lad, and will do well,\" he said, \"an the ladies spoil him not; for he is comely, and of fair manners.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The next knight to ride out from the challengers\u0027 end was Sir Richard Cornwall, a very powerful, strong knight in magnificent armour. His appearance was greeted with a hum of applause.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now, that\u0027s what I call a hardy knight, and something like a man. None of your little jackanapes of Frenchmen and raw youth. Look at his bone--look at his breadth of chest. \u0027Tis a pity he\u0027s an overrun.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But \u0027tis a strong man he\u0027s got against him. \u0027Tis Master Meaux o\u0027 Kingston.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Marry! that\u0027s right. \u0027Tis a good Island name, and he\u0027s a stout Island gentleman, too. \u0027Twill be a rare tussle.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The words of caution were given. The order to go followed, and the two strong figures on their powerful horses met in the midst.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was a shout of applause from every one. The two lances flew up into a thousand splinters, the two horses fell back on their haunches, and the steel-clad figures, erect and firm, wheeling them round, rode back for fresh spears.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"\u0027Twill be a marvel an one of them does not get an ugly knock,\" said Humphrey.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ay, marry will it; they\u0027re tough men-at-arms--but I wish one o\u0027 them splinters would hit that Paxhulle in the eye!\" said Tom o\u0027 Kingston savagely; \"it \u0027ud stop his leering for some time.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Once more the signal was given, and this time something was bound to go. The shock was tremendous.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Holy Thomas! he\u0027s off! he\u0027s down! Mercy! but \u0027twas a fine stroke! Ah! my gay gentleman, but you\u0027re on your back now. Well done, Master Meaux! The Island for ever! A Meaux! A Meaux!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The shouts of joy and the braying of the trumpets were long sustained and hearty. It was the first triumph of the popular side, and the enthusiasm was intense.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sir Richard Cornwall had been overthrown without any disgrace to himself. In such a shock it was clear that every leather and strap of the horses\u0027 harness would be tried to the uttermost, and the girth of his saddle breaking, and the poitral also, he was borne backwards over the crupper to the ground, saddle and all going with him, and his horse nearly falling over backwards; for, like the good knight he was, he never let go of the reins.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"\u0027Twas a pity Master Meaux was not matched against the Frenchman,\" said Humphrey.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ay; but he\u0027ll have to meet him before all\u0027s done. Who\u0027s coming now? Oh, I see, \u0027tis Master Bruyn. He won\u0027t be o\u0027 no account; he\u0027s been brought up too soft,\" commented Tom o\u0027 Kingston.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The first Breton knight now rode out again. It looked ominous for the Squire of Affeton.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But as if divining the popular wish, and in no way desirous of winning fame only at the spear-point, Sir Alain de Kervignac rode the three courses with great skill of horsemanship, but little exercise of strength. And so the Island knight got off scatheless and with honour.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He\u0027s a right gentle knight that Breton. He could have knocked that poor youth all to pieces had he liked; he\u0027s as courteous as he\u0027s stout.\" And all the crowd agreed with Master Paxhulle, and shouted their approval.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There still remained five knights, without counting Bowerman, Newenhall, and Ralph, who were eager to try their prowess with the challengers. The day was getting on; there did not seem a chance of being able to finish the courses unless some of the combatants were disabled in their first tilt. This became apparent to the knights-challengers. They therefore said that as enough had been done for courtesy and love of the ladies, and time was getting on, they would now tilt hardily, and sparing neither man nor horse, and that as they knew there were some youths among their antagonists, they gave this notice to prevent their being hurt.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The coxcombs,\" said Bowerman, when this was announced, \"do they think to frighten us away by words? They are getting afeard for their cattle; but I\u0027ll do my best,\" and Ralph Lisle agreed with him heartily though silently. Not so thought Newenhall, and he determined he would willingly miss his turn when it came, and so let the others get the knocks instead of himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Three other knights also signified their intention of giving those who were more desirous of the honour of encountering the challengers than they were, the priority of place.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e These were Sir John Keineys and Masters Dineley and Leigh, who were all men past the prime of life, and who had merely entered to support the manhood of the Island. Thus only the three pages of the Captain of the Wight, with Dick Oglander, from Nunwell, were left; for Master Tichborne, from Lemerston, had not arrived yet. Master Bowerman now offered himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was greeted with applause, for the crowd had heard the announcement of the challengers, and admired the pluck of the young aspirants to fame who were left.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Everyone knew that it was the page\u0027s first tilt, and the accident from which he had been suffering, combined with the pluck he showed in not retiring when he might easily have done so without loss of honour, created a strong feeling in his favour.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Breton knight was loth also to hurt him, and in their first encounter he hit Bowerman very lightly on the shield, receiving the lance of his opponent on his own helmet, from which the last remnant of his crest was shorn.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well done, Master Bowerman, thou\u0027rt upholding our Island right manfully,\" called out some of the bystanders.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The next course was very well ridden also, the lances splintering, and Bowerman, although reeling from the shock, kept his seat and rode on to the end. Elated by his success, the natural boastfulness of the young man came out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Look to your seat, Sir Breton,\" he called out before the last course, \"for I mean to topple thee out of it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Beshrew the lad for a braggart!\" growled Sir John Trenchard, scandalised alike at the breach of etiquette and the boastfulness of the boy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Sire de Kervignac said nothing; he only courteously bowed, and awaited the signal to charge. It soon came, and they met as before, but with a different result.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Breton knight, as expert as he was brave and strong, seeing how eager and boastful the young man was, determined to read him a lesson. As Bowerman leant well forward, too much so for a firm seat, instead of aiming his spear at the page\u0027s body, or, indeed, directing it at all, the Sire de Kervignac struck a violent blow with the handle or butt-end of his lance over the lance of his antagonist, beating it down, and breaking it all to pieces, with the further result that Bowerman, who was preparing to push with all his might against the expected resistance of the body of his opponent, meeting with no obstacle, and drawn still further over by the blow on his lance, overbalanced himself, and before he could recover his seat, a rude knock from the butt-end of his antagonist\u0027s spear, as he rode past, completed his discomfiture, and he fell headlong to the ground.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"\u0027Twas all his own fault,\" said Tom o\u0027 Kingston. \"The Frenchman never meant to hurt him, and would have left him alone, had he not been such a braggart. It ought to do him good.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was so evident to all the crowd that Bowerman had drawn this fall upon himself that they applauded the knight, and had no words of sympathy for the esquire.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The only antagonist left who had not yet tried his luck was Ralph Lisle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That surely can\u0027t be Master Lisle, the new page?\" said Mistress Bremeskete.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ay, but \u0027tis though; he sits stiffly, don\u0027t he?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And what a size he looks. He\u0027ll be a great knight one day. As \u0027tis, he looks as if he could swallow the little Frenchman at the other end.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Marry, you\u0027re right, and \u0027tis a fine horse he\u0027s on. \u0027Twas Mistress Lisle sent him that this morning.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My! you don\u0027t say so! And she gives her favour to that French knight, and a horse to her kinsman. Well, I\u0027d rather be her kinsman. Leastways, he\u0027s got something.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ralph\u0027s heart was bounding with excitement. He tried to remember all the instructions he had received. He could see Yolande seated amid the beauty and rank of the Island. She was looking his way, not at the knight who wore her favour. She had bidden him win it with the horse he bestrode. His blood rose; he would do all he could. He sat his horse with thews strung tight and nerves braced.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are you ready?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Down came his lance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My faith! he looks a gallant knight,\" said the Captain of the Wight to Yolande. \"I trust Sir Amand will spare him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027faith, Sir Captain, I think \u0027twill be the other way,\" said Yolande. \"He\u0027s well skilled, I hear, and as for strength and weight, look at horse and man.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lord Woodville glanced at Yolande a questioning glance, and smiled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s no use your smiling like that, my Lord Woodville. I know what you are thinking about; but do you, with your knowledge of the world, think I should fall in love with a boy?\" and Yolande laughed a scornful laugh.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lord Woodville made no answer; he only sighed, and turned to look at the lists. The last word had been said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With vigorous determination in Ralph\u0027s bent back, lance close pressed in rest, and helm well under shield, the boy went straight for his prize. He had selected a heavy lance, seeing how many others had splintered, and feeling confident in his strength to wield it. With sure aim he struck the upper part of his antagonist\u0027s visor, and, forcing it up with the violence of the well-planted blow, he bent the metal back, and, still keeping his spear jammed in the twisted iron, while his well-trained horse pressed on with all his force, Ralph actually pulled the knight backwards out of his saddle, and tumbled him over to the ground.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The shouts of applause and astonishment were deafening. The people jumped, and surged, and shouted, and waved their caps and handerchiefs in a perfectly bewildering way. For some time nothing could be heard or seen but the hilarious cries and struggling crowd. It was with the utmost difficulty the men-at-arms and yeomen could keep the lists clear. Men were crowding forward to shake Ralph\u0027s hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e HOW THEY TILTED AT CARISBROOKE.\n\u003cbr\u003e HOW THEY TILTED AT CARISBROOKE.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At last order and silence were somewhat restored, and then it was seen that the Breton knight was on his legs, and had pulled off his helmet, while blood was trickling down his face from the sharp edge of the broken visor having cut his forehead. In spite of this, he was loudly praising Ralph, and saying how glad he was the boy had got the victory.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This made him very popular, and the crowd raised cheer after cheer for the noble Breton knight and Master Ralph Lisle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There\u0027s no older name in the island, and \u0027tis a right noble line,\" said Tom o\u0027 Kingston. \"\u0027Tis right well done, and truly a marvellous feat of arms.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Meanwhile Ralph had ridden round the lists, and had taken up his place again with perfect modesty next to Master Meaux, young Trenchard, and Master Oglander, the only survivors of their party who could ride again.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1700/50060.html","bookId":1153,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 5:19:08 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 5:19:08 AM"}
