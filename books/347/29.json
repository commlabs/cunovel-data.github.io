BARTON","content":"\u0026nbsp;When Herbert realized that he was to be left behind he ran after Willis Ford, and pleaded for the privilege of accompanying him. “Don\u0027t leave me here, Mr. Ford!” he said. “I should die of homesickness!” \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “So you would rather go with me?” Ford said, with an amused smile.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, yes, much rather!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I had not supposed you valued my company so highly. I ought to feel complimented. I am sorry to disappoint you, but I shall have to leave you here for a few weeks. This good lady will take good care of you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Herbert stole a glance at Mrs. Barton, who was watching him with mingled contempt and impatience, but he did not become any more reconciled to the prospect. He reiterated his request.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I have had enough of this,” said Ford, sternly. “You will stop making a fuss if you know what is best for yourself. Good-by! You will hear from me soon.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Herbert realized the uselessness of his resistance, and sank despondently upon the grass.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is he goin\u0027 to stay here, marm?” asked Abner, curiously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes; he\u0027s goin\u0027 to board with us.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ho, ho!” laughed Abner; “he\u0027ll have a nice boardin\u0027 place!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Abner, you jest shut up, or I\u0027ll take a stick to you! You needn\u0027t make him any more homesick than he is. Just try ef you can\u0027t amuse him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Say, Sam, I guess we\u0027ll have a stavin\u0027 time together,” said Abner, really pleased to have a companion. “What\u0027ll we do? Want to play leapfrog?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don\u0027t feel like playing,” answered Herbert, despondently.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We might go fishin\u0027,” suggested Abner. “There\u0027s a pond only a quarter of a mile from here.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don\u0027t know how to fish,” said Herbert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Don\u0027t know how to fish? What do you know how to do?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We don\u0027t have any chance in New York.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Say,” exclaimed Abner, with sudden interest, “is New York a nice place?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I wish I was back there. I never shall be happy anywhere\u0027s else.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Tell me what you fellows do there. I dunno but I\u0027d like to go myself.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Before Herbert had a chance to answer Mrs. Barton broke in:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Abner, you take care of Sam while I go to the village.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What are you goin\u0027 there for, marm?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I\u0027m going to buy some sausages for dinner. We haven\u0027t got anything in the house.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Me and Sam will go, if you\u0027ll give us the money.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I know you too well, Abner Barton. I won\u0027t trust you with the money. Ef I gave you a five-dollar bill, I\u0027d never see any on\u0027t back again.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Say, mam, you haven\u0027t got a five-dollar bill, have you?” asked Abner, with distended eyes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Never you mind!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I\u0027ll tell dad ef you don\u0027t give me some.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You jest dare to do it!” returned Mrs. Barton, in a menacing tone. “Your father ain\u0027t got nothin\u0027 to do with it. It\u0027s money for Sam\u0027s board.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “My name isn\u0027t Sam,” expostulated Herbert, who had a natural preference for his own appellation.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That\u0027s what I\u0027m goin\u0027 to call you. You can call yourself George Washington, or General Jackson, ef you want to. Mebbe you\u0027re Christopher Columbus.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “My name is Herbert Reynolds,” said Herbert, annoyed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That\u0027s what you call yourself to-day. There\u0027s no knowin\u0027 who you\u0027ll be to-morrow.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Don\u0027t you believe me, Mrs. Barton?” asked Herbert, distressed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, I don\u0027t. The man who brung you—I dis-remember his name—”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Willis Ford.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, Willis Ford, then! It seems you know his name. Well, he told me you was loony, and thought you was somebody else than your own self.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He told you that I was crazy?” ejaculated Herbert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes; and I have no doubt it\u0027s so.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It\u0027s a wicked lie!” exclaimed Herbert, indignantly; “and I\u0027d like to tell him so to his face.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, you won\u0027t have a chance for some time. But I can\u0027t stand here talkin\u0027. I must be goin\u0027 to the store. You two behave yourselves while I\u0027m gone!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Herbert felt so dull and dispirited that he did not care to speak, but Abner\u0027s curiosity had been excited about New York, and he plied his young companion with questions, which Herbert answered wearily. Though he responded listlessly, and did not say any more than he felt obliged to, he excited Abner\u0027s interest.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I mean to go to New York some time,” he said. “Is it far?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It\u0027s as much as a thousand miles. It may be more.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Phew! That\u0027s a big distance. How did you come?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We came in the cars.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Did it cost much?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don\u0027t know. Mr. Ford paid for the tickets.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Has he got plenty of money?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don\u0027t think he has. He used to be pa\u0027s clerk.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I wish we had enough money. You and me would start some fine mornin\u0027, and mebbe your father would give me something to do when we got there.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the first time Herbert began to feel an interest in the conversation.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, I wish we could,” he said, fervently. “I know pa would give you a lot of money for bringing me back.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do you really think he would?” asked Abner, briskly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I know he would. But your mother wouldn\u0027t let us go.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “She wouldn\u0027t know it,” said Abner, winking.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You wouldn\u0027t run away from home?” questioned Herbert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why wouldn\u0027t I? What\u0027s to keep me here? Marm\u0027s always scoldin\u0027, and dad gets drunk whenever he has any money to spend for drink. I reckon they wouldn\u0027t care much if I made myself scarce.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Herbert was not sure whether he ought not to feel shocked. He admitted to himself, however, that if he had a father and mother answering the description of Abner\u0027s, that he would not so much regret leaving them. At any rate, Abner\u0027s words awoke a hope of sometime getting away from the place he already hated, and returning to his city home, now more valued than ever.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We can\u0027t go without money,” he said, in a troubled voice.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Couldn\u0027t we walk?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It\u0027s too far, and I\u0027m not strong.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I could walk it, ef I took time enough,” asserted Abner, positively. “Hello! there\u0027s dad!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Herbert looked up, and, following Abner\u0027s glance, saw a man approaching the farmhouse. Mr. Barton—for it was he—was a tall man, shabbily attired, his head crowned with a battered hat, whose gait indicated a little uncertainty, and betrayed some difficulty about the maintenance of his equilibrium.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is that your father?” asked Herbert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It\u0027s the old man, sure enough. He\u0027s about half full.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What\u0027s that?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He\u0027s been drinkin\u0027, as usual; but he didn\u0027t drink enough to make him tight. Guess his funds give out.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Herbert was rather shocked at Abner\u0027s want of respect in speaking of his father, but even to him Mr. Barton hardly seemed like a man who could command a son\u0027s respect.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Wonder whether dad met marm on the way?” said Abner, musing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By this time, Mr. Barton had entered the yard, and caught sight of his son and Herbert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Abner,” said he, in a thick voice, “who\u0027s that boy?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then he didn\u0027t meet marm,” thought Abner. “He\u0027s a boy that\u0027s goin\u0027 to board with us, dad,” he answered.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You don\u0027t say! Glad to make your acquaintance, boy,” he said, straightening up.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you, sir,” answered Herbert, faintly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2976/82028.html","bookId":347,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 9:14:35 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 9:14:35 AM"}
