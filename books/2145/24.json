{"id":96129,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"\u003cp\u003eAlexander and I were in his attic room. My boyfriend was painting a beautiful picture of the rail yard while I attempted to write my English essay on my mom\u0027s laptop. But I was too distracted to begin to write about possible career choices-not only because Alexander was quite the handsome artist, glowing and focused on his creation, but because I could hear the muffled voices of Alexander\u0027s parents talking in their bedroom, one floor below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could barely make out a few words.Mr. Berkley.Sale .Romania .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be right back,\" I said to Alexander, but he was so engrossed in his brushstrokes that I\u0027d probably be back before he even noticed I was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snuck down the attic stairs and tiptoed past his parents\u0027 bedroom. The door was ajar. The bathroom was only a few doors down, and if I hung out inside I\u0027d be able to hear their voices echo off the empty walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Berkley says we need to put money into renovations before this house will ever sell,\" I heard Mr.Sterling say as I passed their doorway. I remained by a hallway table just outside their door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s perfect the way it is,\" Mrs. Sterling responded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree. I\u0027m not changing a thing. My mother built this house the way she wanted it and it will remain that way until there is a new owner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it\u0027s the real estate agency we should change,\" Mrs. Sterling offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a slight pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Constantine,\" Mrs. Sterling began in a soft yet concerned voice. \"Perhaps we are making a mistake by putting the Mansion up for sale at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, Cassandra. I\u0027ve been wrestling with that, too. This has not been an easy decision. I\u0027ve tried to explain that to Alexander,But our lives are inEurope . And now it\u0027s time for us to return.All of us. Our home has always been inRomania . We are too old to change all that now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess you are right. But I do worry-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand it,\" Mr. Sterling added, changing his tone. \"Mr. Berkley said not one person has shown interest. He explained that the townspeople have told him awful things about our home. I\u0027m not sure why anyone would say such things. No one, besides theMadisons , has been inside,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe floorboard underneath me squeaked so loudly, I thought one would be able to hear it inRomania .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bedroom door creaked open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Sterling appeared, and behind him a very tall and statuesque Mrs. Sterling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bathroom doorway that once looked so close now seemed miles away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Raven,\" Mrs. Sterling said, \"We didn\u0027t know you were here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just on my way-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve been meaning to talk to you,\" she said, \"now that you\u0027ve heard about the Mansion going on the market,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know it must be hard for you, Raven-as it is for us,\" Mrs. Sterling said in a soothing voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have done so much for Alexander,\" she continued. \"I know it will be difficult for him being away from you. So you must promise me you\u0027ll visit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder normal conditions, the thought of going toRomania and seeing Alexander\u0027s family would be the thrill of a lifetime. However, if I had a choice, I\u0027d rather vacation inRomania and visit my boyfriend on Benson Hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I promise,\" I said in agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander appeared at the foot of the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on down here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" Mrs. Sterling said. \"We were just passing in the hall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a tinge of sorrow for theSterlings . They were just as torn as we were about the move. They were making what they thought was the best decision, even if it wasn\u0027t the choice Alexander and I would make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t concentrate on writing, and Alexander needed a break from painting. It was getting late, so he drove me home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think our plan is working,\" I said as he walked me to my door. \"At this rate, you\u0027ll be here longer than the Mansion has,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander leaned in and gave me a blissful kiss. For the first night in a long time, I actually got a good night\u0027s rest. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/royal-blood-vampire-kisses-6/page-24.html","bookId":2145,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:17 PM"}
