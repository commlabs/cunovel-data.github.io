He shrugs and turns so I throw the knife to the ground, “You do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step back and pull the arrow back, targeting him and taking a breath to steady my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckles, “Your arm is gonna get sore holding that on me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, “Nope.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walks to the knife and drops to his knees at the deer’s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns her on her side and pushes her feet together. He cuts along the belly, skinning only. He slices and trims quickly. I’m amazed at how fast and clean he is. He pulls off his shirt and lays the meat on it as he removes the hindquarters and backstraps. I let the arrow go slack and watch him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hands me back my bloody knife and wraps the huge pile of meat in the shirt. He slings it over his back like a filthy hobo would have before, “Name’s Jack.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod approvingly, “Emma.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walk back together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You must have been a survivalist, Jack.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, “I was a politician, Emma. There isn’t anyone in the world who is more survivalist than a politician.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs, even with the huge sack of meat on his back, “I hunted every fall with friends. We thought we were survivalists. You know, taking eighty-thousand dollar SUV’s into the woods to stay in a half million-dollar cottage. We would drink and hunt and act like we had a clue.” His voice trails off. He glances at me, “What’s your story?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown, “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grins, “You look like the other kids here but you don’t act like them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy insides sting. I look down, “No story.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were just born knowing how to survive something like this? Born to hunt and fight for everything you have?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, “Oh that. My dad, Lenny, he was big into survival stuff. He owned a health-food store and all his free time was spent learning more things and stock piling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scoffs, “We used to laugh at those people and now look at us all. In the beginning I would have died and gone to heaven to meet someone like him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, “Yeah, he was a single dad, so when I was five he put me in day camps with people who taught us things. I learned about berries and the woods and all this.” I gave him an earnest face, “Beyond the bad things, they taught us about a life like this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowns, “I didn’t know they had day camps like that, not for mall kids.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snort, “They did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, 2012 was a big year for the world ending. No one ever thought it would happen, not really.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, “Lenny did. He had it to the day. Well, he did in his mind. He was off but not by much, couple weeks maybe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe adjusts the bloody sack, “I wish I’d put my kids in camps like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words burn me. I try to keep my nice tone, “Where did you live?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gives me another smile, “Here in Washington. I’ve been here my whole life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, “Are we in Washington?” I never know where I am. I have probably never actually left Washington.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, “Touché.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know what that means but he seems amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe feeling of not being wanted or liked seeps back in as we near the camp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You aren’t that girl Emma who everyone thinks is a monster, are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t say anything, but I know the hateful look on my face gives me away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs, “I should have guessed. The only girl who can hunt and take care of herself is the one they don’t like. My wife woulda liked you. She still might like you, ‘course not in the same way. I last saw her wandering in Seattle before I left. She still looked like her. I mean, minus the fact she was a zombie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give him a harsh look. He shrugs, “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your wife is one of the infected and you let her live like that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes gloss over for a second, “I didn’t have it in me, Emma. I could shoot anything in the whole world but not that woman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t understand that, “You’d let her die slowly instead?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, “I like to imagine she’s out there living peacefully, like an animal might. She’s taking down deer and she’s okay. She has her face in the wind, ya know?” I do know, but I can’t agree with letting her live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grip my bloody knife and think about calling him a name but suddenly Will is there. He makes things in my stomach hurt. ‘Course everything does these days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You kill something?” he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lip curls into a sneer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack laughs, “Will, this is some girl you found. Got an arm on her like I’ve never seen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill’s eyes don’t leave mine, like they’re searching me for something, “I know it, Jack.” I glance at the bandage on his arm where I shot him with an arrow and try my best to hate him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack must sense the awkwardness between me and Will; he starts yakking again, “She downed a deer at a hundred yards with a bow and never even blinked at slitting the throat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill puts a hand out for the bloody sack, “I don’t doubt she did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack gives me a smile and Will the meat, “You want to hunt again, let me know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod at him and walk away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill jogs up, “Carry the meat, Em.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give him a sideways glance, “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let them know you caught it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at the camp of people, “Screw them. I don’t need their help and I don’t care what they think of me. They don’t need to like me. I like that they fear me.” It isn’t all true, but I want it to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn and stalk off for the water. I need to clean up. I hardly even touched the dead deer, but I’ve never felt dirtier. I think it might be Will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I get to the water, I see Jake... of course. He\u0027s swimming and floating and enjoying himself. I want to be angry that he isn\u0027t being useful, but then he swallows some of the water and makes a face like Leo does when he\u0027s trying to get something out of his mouth. I bet he\u0027s swallowed a water bug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he sees me, he doesn\u0027t realize I just saw him being all goofy. He gives me his sexiest smirk, “You back for more skinny dipping?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI make a noise that says no, but I don\u0027t answer him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowers his gaze and makes a disgusted face, drawing my eyes down to the thickened blood dropping from my knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grin until he hops out of the water. Then I swallow, seeing him without his shirt on, sitting on the rocks in a pair of dark-blue shorts that used to be pants. His body is dripping water. I watch it run down his tanned and filled-out chest. He looks better than when I met him, not so skinny. The eating and resting looks good on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head like Leo does to get the water off; it makes the funny feeling in my stomach go away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drop my bow and carry my bloody knife to the water. When I drop to my knees to rinse it off, I swear I can feel him staring at me still. It makes me want to run away, but there\u0027s something I wanna know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance at him, “Why didn’t you tell me about it all before? Why\u0027d you wait?” I don’t need to specify. He knows what I’m talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe makes an awkward face, “Em, this is a bizarre situation. I honestly thought he\u0027d told you. I thought I was last to find out. Not to mention, he’s my brother. I didn’t even know Star’s name when he was with her. Back then, I liked you and I thought you liked me. We spent those couple weeks at the cabin, both laid up. I\u0027d never really talked to many girls my age so I thought it might just be us flirting. But between the time at the cabin together and then on the run, I sort of got the impression you wanted to be mine. I know it was dumb, but I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like I should apologize but I\u0027m not sorry. I liked him. I felt it the minute I met him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs and rubs his hands through his wet hair. He looks at me with his sweet eyes and shakes his head, \"Everything\u0027s changed. It did the minute everything went crazy, and then crazier. I saw the way you looked at him, when you\u0027d chosen him. I figured it was because he could keep you safe. Girls don\u0027t choose guys like me. You and Anna are still saving my ass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance up at him and continue to scrub my knife, “I don’t need anyone to protect me, Jake. I was doing fine on my own before you all came along.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picks a branch up from the rock next to him and sighs, smacking it against the rock, “Why’d you help us if you regret it so much? Why’d you let us in after being alone for so long?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel a strange thickness in my chest. It’s heavy, like I can\u0027t breathe through it. I shake my head. I sit there for a second and try to find an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally I look at him, “I don’t have a reason. I just saw Anna’s face, and the way she was ready to die for you, and I knew she was a person that needed to be saved. I think the world is short on people like you, Anna, Sarah, and Meg. Every town I’ve been to and every group of people I’ve come across, is filled with assholes. Men who take things ‘cause they want them and women who would cheat you to be sure you get hurt before they do. I can\u0027t bear the thought that people like them and Marshall and my father get to live and be happy, but someone as beautiful as Anna might die. The minute I saw you both, I didn’t want you to die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whistles, “Sometimes you open your mouth and stun the shit outta me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh, \"Shut up.\" It makes the heavy feeling in my chest go away. He always makes it lighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drop the knife and pull my outer shirt off. I don’t care that he’s looking. I pull down my pants and kick off my boots. Turning away from him, I dive into the cold water in my tank top and underwear. Breaking the surface of the flat glass-like lake is a stunning feeling. The heat of the day was intense. Even in the mountains, we can’t get a breeze or a cool off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear his splash as I surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When are we leaving here?” he asks as he swims past me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, “You’re not leaving. You gotta go back to the cabin and take care of Sarah and Meg. I think something is up with Mary.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reborn-born-3/page-2.html","bookId":1606,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:05 PM"}
