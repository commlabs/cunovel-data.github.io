He thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath turned to go but, just as he did so, he heard the faintest of noises. It was to sound what one photon is to light, so weak and feeble that it would have passed entirely unheard in the din of an operating universe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a tiny piece of matter, popping into existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath stalked over to the point of arrival and watched carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a paperclip*. (*Many people think it should have been a hydrogen molecule, but this is against the observed facts. Everyone who has found a hitherto unknown egg-whisk jamming an innocent kitchen drawer knows that raw matter is continually flowing into the universe in fairly developed forms, popping into existence normally in ashtrays, vases and glove compartments. It chooses its shape to allay suspicion, and common manifestations are paperclips, the pins out of shirt packaging, the little keys for central heating radiators, marbles, bits of crayon, mysterious sections of herb-chopping devices and old Kate Bush albums. Why matter does this is unclear, but it is evident that matter has Plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is also apparent that creators sometimes favour the Big Bang method of universe construction, and at other times use the more gentle methods of Continual Creation. This follows studies by cosmotherapists which have revealed that the violence of the Big Bang can give a universe serious psychological problems when it gets older.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, it was a start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another pop, which left a small white shirt-button spinning gently in the vacuum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath relaxed a little. Of course, it was going to take some time. There was going to be an interlude before all this got complicated enough to produce gas clouds, galaxies, planets and continents, let alone tiny corkscrew-shaped things wiggling around in slimy pools and wondering whether evolution was worth all the bother of growing fins and legs and things. But it indicated the start of an unstoppable trend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll he had to do was be patient, and he was good at that. Pretty soon there\u0027d be living creatures, developing like mad, running and laughing in the new sunlight. Growing tired. Growing old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath sat back. He could wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhenever they needed him, he\u0027d be there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Universe came into being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny created-again cosmogonist will tell you that all the interesting stuff happened in the firs couple of minutes, when nothingness bunched together to form space and time and lots of really tiny black holes appeared and so on. After that, they say, it became just a matter of, well, matter. It was basically all over bar the microwave radiation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeen from close by, though, it had a certain gaudy attraction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little man sniffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Too showy,” he said. “You don\u0027t need all that noise. It could just as easily have been a Big Hiss, or a bit of music.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Could it?” said Rincewind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, and it looked pretty iffy around the two picosecond mark. Definitely a bit of ropy filling-in. but that\u0027s how it goes these days. No craftsmanship. When I was a lad it took days to make a universe. You could take pride in it. Now they just throw it together and it\u0027s back on the lorry and away. And, you know what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No?” said Rincewind weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They pinches stuff off the site. They finds someone nearby who wants to expand their universe a bit, next thing you know they\u0027ve had it away with a bunch of firmament and flogged it for an extension somewhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRincewind stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man took the pencil from behind his ear and looked reflectively at the space around Rincewind. “I makes things,” he said. “What sort of things?” “What sort of things would you like?” “You\u0027re the Creator?” The little man looked very embarrassed. \"Not the. Not the. Just a. I don\u0027t contract for the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebig stuff, the stars, the gas giants, the pulsars and so on. I just specialise in what you might call the bespoke trade.“ He gave them a look of defiant pride. ”I do all my own trees, you know,“ he confided. ”Craftsmanship. Takes years to learn how to make a tree. Even the conifers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” said Rincewind. “I don\u0027t get someone in to finish them off. No sub-contracting, that\u0027s my motto. The buggers always keep you hanging about while they\u0027re installing stars or something for someone else. ”The little man sighed. \"You know, people think it must all be very easy,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecreating. They think you just have to move on the face of the waters and wave your hands a bit. It\u0027s not like that at all.“ ”It isn\u0027t?“ The little man scratched his nose again. ”You soon run out of ides for snowflakes, for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eexample.“ ”Oh.“ ”You start thinking it\u0027d be a doddle to sneak in a few identical ones.“ ”You do?“ ”You think to yourself, `There\u0027s a billion trillion squillion of them, no-one\u0027s going to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enotice`. But that\u0027s where professionalism comes in, sort of thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It does?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some people” - and here the creator looked sharply at the unformed matter still streaming past - “think it\u0027s enough to install a few basic physical formulas and then take the money and run. A billion years later you got leaks all over the sky, black holes the size of your head, and when you pray up to complain there\u0027s just a girl on the counter who says she don\u0027t know where the boss is. I think people appreciate the personal touch, don\u0027t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah,” said Rincewind. “So... when people get struck by lightning... er... it\u0027s not just because of all that stuff about electrical discharges and high points and everything... er... you actually mean it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, not me. I don\u0027t run the things. It\u0027s a big enough job just building \u0027em, you can\u0027t expect me to operate them as well. There\u0027s a load of other universes, you know,” he added, a slight note of accusation in his voice. “Got a list of jobs as long as your arm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached underneath him and produced a large, leatherbound book, which he had apparently been sitting on. It opened with a creak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRincewind felt a tugging at his robe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look,” said Eric. “This isn\u0027t really... Him, is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He says it is,” said Rincewind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are we doing here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe creator glared at him. “A little quiet there, please,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But listen,” hissed Eric, “if he really is the creator of the world, that sandwich is a religious relic!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gosh,” said Rincewind weakly. He hadn\u0027t eaten for ages. He wondered what the penalty was for eating a venerated object. It was probably severe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You could put it in a temple somewhere and millions of people would come to look at it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRincewind cautiously levered up the top slice of bread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s got no mayonnaise in it,” he said. “Will that still count?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe creator cleared his throat, and began to read aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAstfgl surfed across the entropy slope, an angry red spark against the swirls of interspace. He was so angry now that the last vestiges of self-control were slipping away; his jaunty cap with its stylish hornlets had become a mere wisp of crimson dangling from the tip of one of the great coiled ramshorns that framed his skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a rather sensuous ripping noise the red silk across his back tore open and his wings unfolded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey are conventionally represented as leathery, but leather wouldn\u0027t survive more than a few seconds in that environment. Besides, it doesn\u0027t fold up very well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese wings were made of magnetism and shaped space, and spread out until they were a faint curtain against the incandescent firmament and they beat as slowly as the rise of civilisations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey still looked batlike, but that was just for the sake of tradition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere around the 29th millennium he was overtaken, quite without noticing, by something small and oblong and probably even angrier than he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEight spells go to make up the world. Rincewind knew that well enough. He knew that the book which contained them was the Octavo, because it still existed in the library of the Unseen University - currently inside a welded iron box at the bottom of a specially-dug shaft, where its magical radiations could be kept under control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRincewind had wondered how it had all started. He\u0027d imagined a sort of explosion in reverse, with interstellar gases roaring together to form Great A\u0027Tuin, or at least a roll of thunder or something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead there was a faint, musical twang, and where the Discworld hadn\u0027t been, there the Discworld was, as if it had always been hiding somewhere the whole time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also realised that the feeling of falling he had so recently learned to live with was one he was probably going to die with, too. As the world appeared beneath him it brought this aeon\u0027s special offer - gravity, available in a choice of strengths from your nearest massive planetary body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, as so often happens on these occasions, “Aargh.” The creator, still sitting serenely in mid-air, appeared beside him as he plummeted. “Nice clouds, don\u0027t you think? Done a good job on the clouds,” he said. “Aargh.” Rincewind repeated. “Something the matter?” “Aargh.” “That\u0027s humans for you,” said the creator. “Always rushing off somewhere.” He leaned\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecloser. “It\u0027s not up to me, of course, but I\u0027ve often wondered what it is that goes through your heads.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s going to be my feet in a minute!” screamed Rincewind. Eric, falling alongside him, tugged at his ankle. “That\u0027s not the way to talk to the creator of the universe!” he shouted. “Just tell him to do something, make the ground soft or something!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“O, I dunno if I could do that,” said the creator. “It\u0027s causality regulations. I\u0027d have the Inspector down on me like a ton of, a ton of, a ton of weight,” he added. “I could probably knock you up a really spongy bog. Or quicksand\u0027s very popular at the moment. I could do you a complete quicksand with marsh and swamp en suite, no problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“!” said Rincewind. “You\u0027re going to have to speak up a bit, I\u0027m sorry. Wait a moment.” There was another harmonious twanging noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Rincewind opened his eyes he was standing on a beach. So was Eric. The creator\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efloated nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no rushing wind. He hadn\u0027t go so much as a bruise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just wedged a thingy in the velocities and positions,” said the creator, noticing his expression. “Now: what was it you were saying?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I rather wanted to stop plunging to my death,” said Rincewind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. Good. Glad that\u0027s sorted out, then.” The creator looked around distractedly. “You haven\u0027t seen my book around, have you? I thought I had it in my hand when I started.” He sighed. “Lose me own head next. I done a whole world once and completely left out the fingles. Not one of the buggers. Couldn\u0027t get \u0027em at the time, told myself I could nip back when they were in stock, completely forgot. Imagine that. No-one spotted it, of course, because obviously they just evolved there and they didn\u0027t know there ought to be fingles, but it was definitely causing them deep, you know, psychological problems. Deep down inside they could tell there was something missing, sort of thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe creator pulled himself together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anyway, I can\u0027t hang about all day,” he said. “Like I said, I\u0027ve got a lot of jobs on.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eric-discworld-9/page-13.html","bookId":1628,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:23 PM"}
