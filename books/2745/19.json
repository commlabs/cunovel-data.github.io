She loves you; what’s the big deal?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you know?” I sit up, waiting for her to tell me how she knows. I never wanted Liz to tell me she loved me until she was ready. I didn’t want to force her, but that’s exactly what I did, held her down and forced her to tell me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She told me,” November says in a duh-tone, the same one she uses with all of us boys when she thinks were being stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would she tell you and not me?” Now, I\u0027m pissed that she’s felt the same way I have and has never said anything, while I’ve been stewing over this for the last few weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She wanted to make sure you were both in the same place before she told you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus, why do women do that? Why do you guys think that you know what we’re thinking?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re a guy; you think about sex and sports. It’s not hard to figure out.” She laughs right before I hear a loud smack. “Asher,” she says, then I hear the phone go quite, and a loud moan. I hang up before I can hear anything else. Listening to my brother have sex with someone who I consider a sister is never going to happen. I lay back on the bed, closing my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wake to the sound of someone banging on the door. I look over at the clock; I’ve been asleep for about two hours. “Coming!” I yell. I don’t even look to see who it is; I just open the door, still half asleep. I’m caught off guard when I’m slammed into the wall by my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the fuck are you doing with my sister?” Tim asks, his arm planted in my throat. I use my free arm to swing over, switching our positions. He’s not expecting the move, judging by the way his body slams into the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen to me, you piece of shit,” I growl, my hand going around his throat. “I love her, and that’s more than I can say for you, the one who had the nerve to steal her money, forcing her to take a second job that just so happened to be working at a fucking strip club.” I’m so pissed, I can feel my blood rushing through my veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have no idea what you’re talking about,” he coughs out when I loosen the hand around his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know what I’m talking about? I’m the one she cries to,” I retighten my hold around his neck. “Don’t tell me I don’t know what I’m talking about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t have a choice. I need the money. I found out that Kara was pregnant and had to pay off some debts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you stole from your family?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t have a kid on the way; you don’t understand.” I shove away from him, walking into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re right. I don’t have a kid on the way. But I’ve got a girl and a family, no way I’d put either of them in the middle of my shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, the great Trevor Mayson is all of a sudden better than everyone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t know anything about me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, but doesn’t everyone know about you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you really come find me to talk about this shit?” I ask, crossing my arms over my chest. My blood is boiling. If it wasn’t for my promise to Liz, his ass would be hanging over the balcony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to know what you’re doing with my sister.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t get to ask that; you don’t get to play the role of the big brother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love my mom and sister. You may not believe me, but I do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Prove it. Come back to town and earn back the money you owe her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have Kara. I—“\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a step towards him, cutting him off. “That’s your choice; but I’m telling you now, if you push me, I will insist that Liz press charges.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t come back to town right now. I’m working undercover.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head in disgust. “That lie might work on your mom, but it’s not working on me. “\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck you,” he shouts, his face turning red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How long are you going to keep that lie up for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not a lie. The people I owed money to trusted me. The cops had no one on the inside, and when they found out about my debt, they offered to pay it off in exchange for me going undercover.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If they paid off your debt, why did you take the money from your sister?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The money I took from her paid the debt; the money the cops gave me paid my interest.” I watched him start to pace, his hands running through his shaggy blonde hair. “I had been seeing Kara for a while when she told me she was pregnant.” He stops, his eyes meeting mine. “This was around the time that I lost my last bet. I knew I needed to get out from under the people I owed; no way was I going to have a kid and have to look over my shoulder.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you took the money, started working for the cops, asked Kara to marry you, and went on your merry way. All the while, your sister is staying in the back room of her store after losing her apartment, working for Mike so that she doesn’t lose her dream, and you’re living it up, not wondering about the damage you left behind?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you’re with her, then why the fuck was she working at a fucking strip club?” he yells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me working for Mike had nothing to do with Trevor,” Liz says, walking into the room. She sets her bag down on the bed, coming to my side. Her arm goes around the back of my waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy girl must not be in the mood to listen. “You need to leave, Tim.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Tim asks, looking at me. Wrong person. I would always side with Liz; even if I liked him, I would still side with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You need to leave,” she states, more firmly this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We need to talk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The only thing that I want to hear from you right now is that you’re coming home to pay off your debt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t do that right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, then, we have nothing to talk about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sis, don’t do this,” he pleads, his face looking panicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You never took my feelings into consideration when you did what you did to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want you to have a relationship with your nephew; you can’t just cut me out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look down at Liz when her nails dig into my side. “That’s not fair,” she whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You need to go,” I tell Tim, stepping in front of Liz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re not done talking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Until you’re ready to tell your sister that you’re going to pay back the money you owe, I don’t think there is anything for you to talk about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tomorrow is the wedding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you see the look on your sister’s face?” I point towards Liz. “I don’t like my woman looking like that, so you need to leave. Tomorrow, if she feels like it, then she will find you; if not, then you need to back the fuck off,” I say, pushing him towards the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who do you think you are?” he asks, making me smile. “I’m her man; and as her man, I can do whatever the fuck I want to anyone I perceive as a threat against her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m her brother,” he says, sputtering as I slam the door in his face. When I turn around, I’m surprised to see Liz smiling. I figured she would be pissed that I just kicked her brother out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” she says, throwing herself into my arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For getting rid of him.” She tucks her face into my chest, and I pull her small body tighter against mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will always protect you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know,” she says softly, making me squeeze her a little tighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you have a good time with you mom?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” she giggles. I pull her face out of my chest so I can see her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s so funny?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing,” she says, her face turning red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing,” she says again, taking a step back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your face is bright red,” I tell her, looking her over. Her hair is the same as when she left, her skin looks smooth, and she smells like lavender. “Did you get a massage?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” she replies, looking down at the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What else did you guys do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Got manicures and pedicures,” she mumbles, still not making eye contact. Then a light bulb goes off, and I’m very interested in finding out if my hunch is correct. I step towards her, my hands going to her dress, and I rip it off over her head. “What are you doing?” she screeches, trying to get away; but I have her trapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to see for myself what you had done,” I tell her, pushing her back until she has no choice but to sit on the edge of the bed. Dropping to my knees, I pull her foot up towards my chest. “I like this color; what is it called?” I ask, inspecting the light pink color of her nail polish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e”Passionate pink,” she says, trying to pull her foot out of my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e”Passionate pink,” I repeat. I kiss the top of her foot, before setting it on my shoulder. I run my cheek down the inside of her calf, then up her thigh. “Your skin is so soft.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…I had a body scrub done.” Her voice is breathy; I look up and see that her eyes are hooded and dark, and her cheeks are flushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick up her other foot, setting it on my other shoulder. My hands pull her knees apart, and I run a finger down the center of her panties. Her hips lift slightly. I lean forward, opening my mouth over the thin cotton that’s covering her, and bite down slightly, making her moan. “You smell good.” I press my tongue in, making her moan louder. “Tell me you want me to eat you.” I look up her body; her head is back, eyes closed. My cock is begging me to pull her down and impale her, but I want her taste on my tongue. “Say ‘Trevor, please eat my pussy’.” Her eyes open, and she looks at my mouth. Then I bite down again, making her squirm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Trevor, please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run my finger along the edge of her panties and dip in slightly, feeling her smooth skin, knowing I was right. “Say it. Say ‘Trevor, please eat my pussy’,” I growl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Trevor, please eat—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t even let her finish. I slide her panties to the side and attack her, licking, biting, and devouring her. “So sweet,” I mumble against her. Her hips raise, and her fingers dig into my scalp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More,” she whimpers, circling her hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My greedy girl,” I mumble against her, sliding two fingers deep inside her tightness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Trevor!” she screams, her pussy convulsing around my fingers. Her feet try to push me away, but I hold her tighter, wrapping my arms around her thighs, and keeping her in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop!” she cries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Give me another one.” I lick her, circling her clit, then sucking deep. Her hips buck, trying to get free. I pull her harder against my mouth, my tongue moving faster until she comes, screaming. I crawl up the bed and pull her body against mine. “There is nothing more beautiful than watching your body being taken over by what I’m doing to you,” I say, sliding between her legs. Her hands go up the front of my shirt, sliding down to the waistband of my shorts. I sit back on my knees, pulling my shirt off over my head. She sits up, unbuttoning my shorts, and tugging them down my hips, her mouth against my abs. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/until-trevor-until-2/page-19.html","bookId":2745,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:47:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:47:16 PM"}
