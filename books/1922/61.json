When Clancy pulled up and hopped out to open the back door for me, I was startled to see my mom already inside. It was early yet. I\u0027d expected to be driven solo to the apartment she shared with Stanton and wait on her twenty minutes or so. That was our usual routine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Mom,\" I said wearily, settling on the seat beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could you, Eva?\" She was crying into a monogrammed handkerchief, her face beautiful even while reddened and wet with tears. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJolted out of my torment by her misery, I frowned and asked, \"What did I do now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new cell phone, if she\u0027d somehow found about it, wouldn\u0027t trigger this much drama. And it was too soon after the fact for her to know about my breakup with Gideon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told Gideon Cross about...what happened to you.\" Her lower lip trembled with distress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head jerked back in shock. How could she know that? My God...Had she bugged my new place? My purse...? \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t act clueless!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know I told him?\" My voice was a pained whisper. \"We just talked last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He went to see Richard about it today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to picture Stanton\u0027s face during that conversation. I couldn\u0027t imagine my stepfather taking it well. \"Why would he do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wanted to know what\u0027s been done to prevent information leaks. And he wanted to know where Nathan is - \" She sobbed. \"He wanted to know everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy breath hissed out between my teeth. I wasn\u0027t sure what Gideon\u0027s motivation was, but the possibility that he\u0027d dumped me over Nathan and was now making sure that he was safe from scandal hurt worse than anything. I twisted in pain, my spine arching away from the seatback. I\u0027d thought it was his past that drove a wedge between us, but it made more sense that it was mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor once I was grateful for my mother\u0027s self-absorption, which kept her from seeing how devastated I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He had a right to know,\" I managed in a voice so raw it sounded nothing like my own. \"And he has a right to try and protect himself from any blowback.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve never told any of your other boyfriends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never dated anyone who makes national headlines by sneezing, either.\" I stared out the car window at the traffic that boxed us in. \"Gideon Cross and Cross Industries are global news, Mother. He\u0027s light-years away from the guys I dated in college.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spoke more, but I didn\u0027t hear her. I shut down for self-protection, cutting off the reality that was suddenly too painful to be endured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Petersen\u0027s office was exactly as I remembered. Decorated in soothing neutrals, it was both professional and comfortable. Dr. Petersen was the same - a handsome man with gray hair and gentle, intelligent blue eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe welcomed us into his office with a wide smile, commenting on how lovely my mother looked and how like her I was. He said he was happy to see me again and that I looked well, but I could tell he spoke for my mother\u0027s benefit. He was too trained an observer to miss the raging emotions I suppressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So,\" he began, settling into his chair across from the sofa my mother and I sat on. \"What brings you both in today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him about the way my mom had been tracking my movements via my cell phone signal and how violated I felt. Mom told him about my interest in Krav Maga and how she took it as a sign that I wasn\u0027t feeling safe. I told him about how they\u0027d pretty much taken over Parker\u0027s studio, which made me feel suffocated and claustrophobic. She told him I\u0027d betrayed her trust by divulging deeply personal matters to strangers, which made her feel na**d and painfully exposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough it all, Dr. Petersen listened attentively, took notes and spoke rarely, until we\u0027d purged everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we\u0027d quieted, he asked, \"Monica, why didn\u0027t you tell me about tracking Eva\u0027s cell phone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe angle of her chin altered, a familiar defensive posture. \"I didn\u0027t see anything wrong with it. Many parents track their children through their cell phones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Underage children,\" I shot back. \"I\u0027m an adult. My personal time is exactly that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you were to envision yourself in her place, Monica,\" Dr. Petersen interjected, \"would it be possible that you might feel as she does? What if you discovered someone was monitoring your movements without your knowledge or permission?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not if the someone was my mother and I knew it gave her peace of mind,\" she argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And have you considered how your actions affect Eva\u0027s peace of mind?\" he queried gently. \"Your need to protect her is understandable, but you should discuss the steps you wish to take openly with her. It\u0027s important to gain her input - and expect cooperation only when she chooses to give it. You have to honor her prerogative to set limits that may not be as broad as you\u0027d like them to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother sputtered indignantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eva needs her boundaries, Monica,\" he continued, \"and a sense of control over her own life. Those things were taken from her for a long time and we have to respect her right to establish them now in the manner that best suits her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" My mother twisted her handkerchief around her fingers. \"I hadn\u0027t thought of it that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached out for my mother\u0027s hand when her lower lip trembled violently. \"Nothing could\u0027ve stopped me from talking to Gideon about my past. But I could have forewarned you. I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t think of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re much stronger than I ever was,\" my mother said, \"but I can\u0027t help worrying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My suggestion,\" Dr. Petersen said, \"would be for you to take some time, Monica, and really think about what sorts of events and situations cause you anxiety. Then write them down.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-61.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
