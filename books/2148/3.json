Though everyone at Legend\u0027s Run High didn\u0027t hang out together, we all knew one another. It was odd to see a strange face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was late October, just after the campfire and werewolf-scare outing, and I was taking notes in government class when something caught my attention. Outside our classroom window, I saw an olive green beat-up Jeep pulling into an empty space in the student parking lot. I had to squint but noticed a WWF sticker on the front bumper. The driver-side door opened and a guy got out, wearing a vintage brown leather motorcycle jacket, torn jeans, and black hiking boots. He walked into the school building. A few moments later, the bell rang to change classes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I arrived at English class, I found my desk occupied. The guy in the vintage leather jacket was riffling through his backpack and placing a notebook on my desktop. In Mrs. Clark\u0027s class the students weren\u0027t seated in alphabetical order, or any other order for that matter, but rather we elected to take a desk where we wanted. Since school began, I sat in row six, first chair from the window. Abby sat next to me and Ivy next to her. Their boyfriends and Nash sat along the row nearest to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I noticed the stranger sitting in my seat, I didn\u0027t know what to do. I preferred to sit by my friends, but he was a new student and I wasn\u0027t about to tell him to move\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I just didn\u0027t think it was polite. Instead, I chose an empty chair in the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvy spotted the stranger sitting in my seat and took it upon herself to confront the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s okay - \" I tried to say, but my words weren\u0027t heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me, that desk is already taken,\" she said abrasively. Ivy got very territorial when it came to breaking up our clique. But it was okay with me. I could survive a day sitting on my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new guy opened his notebook and looked up at the blond girl hovering over him, scolding him as if she were the teacher. I was hoping Ivy wasn\u0027t going to make a fuss. The new student would probably have moved had she been polite, but it seemed as if it was too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hid behind my textbook. For a moment Ivy wasn\u0027t as confident as she was when she first approached him. I hoped this meant she was going to soften and either apologize or just return to her seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, Abby joined her. Even though Ivy and Abby were pretty, their temperaments could sometimes leave even the kindest gentlemen challenging them to a duel rather than tipping their hats. Ivy threw her hair back and straightened her stance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is my friend\u0027s desk,\" Ivy said, again in a very unpleasant tone. \"She sits here every day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new guy didn\u0027t budge. He paused, weighing his words. \"Are you two on the welcoming committee?\" he asked. \"I didn\u0027t see your pictures in the brochure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few skater students around him snickered. I couldn\u0027t help but giggle, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby tightened her lips. After all, she was used to competition, and it appeared that she wanted to win this battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand you are new...\" Abby charged, in a strong whisper, \"but things work a certain way here, and the sooner you know this the easier it will be for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat up and leaned into Ivy. \"This is your friend?\" he said to her. \"You might want to reconsider.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all laughed again, even Dylan and Jake, who probably wished they could have said it. Abby and Ivy both folded their arms. It was clear the new student wasn\u0027t going to budge under the pressure of his two bossy classmates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, that is our friend,\" they said in unison. Then they both pointed to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new guy turned around. He was completely captivating and model gorgeous. His short hair was dark and wavy, his face as perfectly sculpted as I\u0027d ever seen. He stared straight at me\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;his eyes a deep, riveting royal blue. We locked gazes and I almost lost my breath. My face flushed red. I was unable to look away, and I didn\u0027t really want to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never felt such a powerful stare\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;or witnessed such a handsome student.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe almost broke a smile, and my heart along with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe new student turned back, grabbed his notebook and backpack, and rose. He towered over my friends, who were blocking his way. They stepped aside, and he moved to an empty chair in the back of the class without another word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Ivy and Abby waved me over, I slunk back to my desk. When Mrs. Clark introduced the new student as Brandon Maddox, I wasn\u0027t about to turn around and make eye contact with him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLegend\u0027s Run High School\u0027s lunchroom was a microcosm of Legend\u0027s Run itself. Students stuck to their sides and, like religious sects, were subdivided. The usual gamers, jocks, skaters, and preps each had their own table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLunch, for me, was the highlight of the school day. I got to hang out with my friends and talk and eat\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;two of my favorite things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I reached the cafeteria, Ivy pulled Abby and me over to the vending machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I finally have the four-one-one on the new guy,\" she began. \"I heard he\u0027s a Westsider.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Obviously,\" Abby said. \"Did you see his coat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was nothing wrong with his coat. I liked it - \" I tried. \"Besides, you didn\u0027t have to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you two want to hear this or not?\" Ivy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course we do,\" Abby replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He lives with his grandparents,\" Ivy began. \"I think he\u0027s from Miller\u0027s Glen and was kicked out of his home. He\u0027s a juvie - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard he\u0027s a runaway,\" Abby said, placing a dollar into the machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did?\" Ivy felt challenged that she wasn\u0027t on top of the breaking news story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. A runaway,\" Abby said. She pushed a cola button and grabbed her diet soda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard he\u0027s a juvie,\" Ivy argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard he\u0027s a runaway,\" Abby insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard...\" I started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" they asked curiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard that he\u0027s...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on...\" they pried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard that he\u0027s a... werewolf!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both were aghast. \"You did not!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That can\u0027t be true,\" Abby said. \"I didn\u0027t hear that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who told you that?\" Ivy pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snickered. \"Hello, are you kidding?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen we all broke out in laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we continued to crack up, I spotted Brandon sitting at a back table in the corner, alone. He was eating a sandwich and reading a book. The tables around him were filled, crowded with students gabbing and letting loose on their lunch break. This might have been my favorite part of the day, but for him, it must have been the most lonesome. My giggling subsided. I felt a huge ache in the pit of my stomach. It must be horribly lonely and difficult to come to a new school with no real friends\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;especially a school as cliquey as ours. And I felt ashamed that my two friends had been so unwelcoming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about going over to him and apologizing for my friends\u0027 behavior when two strong arms wrapped around my waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly I was lifted off the ground and swung around. I noticed a familiar class ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nash! Get off,\" I cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you staring at?\" he questioned, letting me down. \"You should be staring at me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spun me so I faced him and he kissed me. Nash was a great kisser; for a brief moment I forgot where I was. But then it dawned on me. I wasn\u0027t in the privacy of a moonlit goodnight kiss, but rather I was in the middle of the lunchroom with two hundred hungry gawkers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was never comfortable with Nash\u0027s public displays of affection. It always felt as if he was only being demonstrative to prove his bravado to the student body rather than showing the unbridled passion of an amorous boyfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe released me. I was dizzy\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;not so much from the kiss but from his spinning me. When my double vision returned to normal, I realized I was staring right across the lunchroom at Brandon. I sensed he\u0027d been watching me the whole time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something riveting about him, unusual, and different. I wasn\u0027t sure why I felt embarrassed in front of Brandon more so than the other students watching us. All I knew was that I did. I wiped my mouth with my sleeve, sat down at our table with my back toward the new student, and distracted myself with a low-carb lunch and wonderfully inane conversation. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-in-a-full-moon-full-moon-1/page-3.html","bookId":2148,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:03 PM"}
