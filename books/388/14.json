CARL ARRIVES IN MILFORD.","content":"\u0026nbsp;The tramp stopped short, and eyed Carl’s small defender, first with curious surprise, and then with derision. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Out of my way, you midget!” he cried, “or ‘ll hurt you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Try it!” said the little man, showing no sign of fear.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why, you’re no bigger than a kid. I can upset you with one finger.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He advanced contemptuously, and laid his hand on the shoulder of the dwarf. In an instant Jennings had swung his flail-like arms, and before the tramp understood what was happening he was lying flat on his back, as much to Carl’s amazement as his own.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He leaped to his feet with an execration, and advanced again to the attack. To be upset by such a pigmy was the height of mortification.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I’m going to crush you, you mannikin!” he threatened.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Jennings put himself on guard. Like many small men, he was very powerful, as his broad shoulders and sinewy arms would have made evident to a teacher of gymnastics. He clearly understood that this opponent was in deadly earnest, and he put out all the strength which he possessed. The result was that his large-framed antagonist went down once more, striking his head with a force that nearly stunned him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It so happened that at this juncture reinforcements arrived. A sheriff and his deputy drove up in an open buggy, and, on witnessing the encounter, halted their carriage and sprang to the ground.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What is the matter, Mr. Jennings?” asked the sheriff, respectfully, for the little man was a person of importance in that vicinity.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That gentleman is trying to extort a forced loan, Mr. Cunningham.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ha! a footpad?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The sheriff sprang to the side of the tramp, who was trying to rise, and in a trice his wrists were confined by handcuffs.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I think I know you, Mike Frost,” he said. “You are up to your old tricks. When did you come out of Sing Sing?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Three weeks since,” answered the tramp, sullenly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “They want you back there. Come along with me!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was assisted into the buggy, and spent that night in the lockup.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Did he take anything from you, Carl?” asked Mr. Jennings.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, sir; but I was in considerable danger. How strong you are!” he added, admiringly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Strength isn’t always according to size!” said the little man, quietly. “Nature gave me a powerful, though small, frame, and I have increased my strength by gymnastic exercise.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Jennings did not show the least excitement after his desperate contest. He had attended to it as a matter of business, and when over he suffered it to pass out of his mind. He took out his watch and noted the time.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It is later than I thought,” he said. “I think I shall have to give up my plan of walking the rest of the way.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then I shall be left alone,” thought Carl regretfully.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Just then a man overtook them in a carriage.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He greeted Mr. Jennings respectfully.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Are you out for a long walk?” he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, but I find time is passing too rapidly with me. Are you going to Milford?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Can you take two passengers?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You and the boy?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes; of course I will see that you don’t lose by it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I ought not to charge you anything, Mr. Jennings. Several times you have done me favors.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And I hope to again, but this is business. If a dollar will pay you, the boy and I will ride with you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It will be so much gain, as I don’t go out of my way.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You can take the back seat, Carl,” said Mr. Jennings. “I will sit with Mr. Leach.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They were soon seated and on their way.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Relative of yours, Mr. Jennings?” asked Leach, with a backward glance at Carl.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Like most country folks, he was curious about people. Those who live in cities meet too many of their kind to feel an interest in strangers.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No; a young friend,” answered Jennings, briefly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Goin’ to visit you?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, I think he will stay with me for a time.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then the conversation touched upon Milford matters in which at present Carl was not interested.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n After his fatiguing walk our hero enjoyed the sensation of riding. The road was a pleasant one, the day was bright with sunshine and the air vocal with the songs of birds. For a time houses were met at rare intervals, but after a while it became evident that they were approaching a town of considerable size.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is this Milford, Mr. Jennings?” asked Carl.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes,” answered the little man, turning with a pleasant smile.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How large is it?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I think there are twelve thousand inhabitants. It is what Western people call a ‘right smart place.’ It has been my home for twenty years, and I am much attached to it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And it to you, Mr. Jennings,” put in the driver.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That is pleasant to hear,” said Jennings, with a smile.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It is true. There are few people here whom you have not befriended.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That is what we are here for, is it not?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I wish all were of your opinion. Why, Mr. Jennings, when we get a city charter I think I know who will be the first mayor.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Not I, Mr. Leach. My own business is all I can well attend to. Thank you for your compliment, though. Carl, do you see yonder building?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He pointed to a three-story structure, a frame building, occupying a prominent position.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That is my manufactory. What do you think of it?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I shouldn’t think a town of this size would require so large an establishment,” answered Carl.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Jennings laughed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You are right,” he said. “If I depended on Milford trade, a very small building would be sufficient. My trade is outside. I supply many dealers in New York City and at the West. My retail trade is small. If any of my neighbors want furniture they naturally come to me, and I favor them as to price out of friendly feeling, but I am a manufacturer and wholesale dealer.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I see, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Shall I take you to your house, Mr. Jennings?” asked Leach.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, if you please.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Leach drove on till he reached a two-story building of Quaker-like simplicity but with a large, pleasant yard in front, with here and there a bed of flowers. Here he stopped his horse.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We have reached our destination, Carl,” said Mr. Jennings. “You are active. Jump out and I will follow.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Carl needed no second invitation. He sprang from the carriage and went forward to help Mr. Jennings out.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, thank you, Carl,” said the little man. “I am more active than you think. Here we are!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He descended nimbly to the ground, and, drawing a one-dollar bill from his pocket, handed it to the driver.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don’t like to take it, Mr. Jennings,” said Mr. Leach.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why not? The laborer is worthy of his hire. Now, Carl, let us go into the house.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2963/81556.html","bookId":388,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 4:08:52 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 4:08:52 AM"}
