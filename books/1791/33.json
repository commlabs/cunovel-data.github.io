He was pulling his shirt over his head by the time Nathan caught up with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s happening now?\" Nathan demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jade\u0027s gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn,\" Nathan muttered. \"You going after her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could use my help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Caine snapped. \"I\u0027ll find her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan reluctantly nodded. \"You any good at tracking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine nodded. \"I\u0027m good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She left you a message.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan strolled over to the side of Caine\u0027s bed and lifted the long-stemmed white rose from the pillow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe inhaled the sweet fragrance, then walked over to the window to look outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she in love with you?\" Nathan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She is,\" Caine answered. His voice lost its brittle edge. \"She just doesn\u0027t know it yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan tossed the rose back on the bed. \"I\u0027d say Jade was telling you goodbye when she left you the rose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She might be reminding you who she is, Caine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s part of it,\" Caine said. He completed his change of clothes, stomped into his boots, and started\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what\u0027s the rest?\" Nathan asked as he trailed after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry\u0027s right,\" Caine muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s trying to impress me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan laughed. \"That, too,\" he agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine bellowed for Sterns as he bounded down the stairs. The servant appeared at the doorway to the drawing room. \"Lyon will find Richards for us,\" Caine said. \"When the two arrive, make them wait until\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get back, no matter how long it takes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if your friend can\u0027t find Richards?\" Nathan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll find him,\" Caine answered. \"I probably won\u0027t be back before tomorrow morning,\" he said. \"Take care of things while I\u0027m gone, Sterns. You know what to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meaning the guards, mi\u0027lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine nodded. He started for the door, but Sterns\u0027 question stopped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going, mi\u0027lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hunting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door slammed shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Fourteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew and Jimbo appeared to be as weary as Jade was by the time they reached their destination. It had been decided that they would spend the night in the isolated inn Harry frequented when he was on the run. Jade had insisted they take a roundabout way there, adding two more hours\u0027 travel, just as an added precaution against being followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe innkeeper was a friend of Black Harry\u0027s, a little on the disreputable side as well, and therefore never asked unnecessary questions. If he thought it odd a finely dressed young lady was traveling with two\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emen who looked like they\u0027d cut a man\u0027s throat for two pence, he certainly didn\u0027t remark upon it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade was given the center bedchamber above the stairs. Jimbo and Matthew took the rooms on either\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eside of her. Since the walls were paper-thin, neither man worried that anyone would be able to breach their temporary fortress. The steps were so old and rickety, a mouse would have made noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade soaked in a hot bath, then wrapped herself in Caine\u0027s robe. She was stiff and out of sorts by the time she went to bed. Her injury from the pistol shot was almost completely healed now, but it still itched something fierce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade fell asleep saying a prayer that the nightmare would not visit her tonight, worrying she might cry\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eout and cause Matthew and Jimbo alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe air turned chilly during the night. Jade burrowed under the covers. She never felt Caine climb into\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe bed beside her. When he put his arm around her and gently pulled her up against his side, she let\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eout a soft sigh and snuggled closer to his familiar warmth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoonlight filtered through the small window. He smiled when he saw she was wearing his robe. Then\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe slowly slipped the garment off her. That task completed, he removed her knife from under the pillow, then began to nibble on the side of her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was slow to wake up. \"Caine?\" she whispered, her voice a sleepy blur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, love?\" he whispered in her ear before his tongue swept inside to tease. She started shivering. It\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas just the reaction he wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand moved down her chest, circled her navel, then trailed a hot path to one of her breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed again. He was so warm, smelled so wonderful, and oh, how he was making the cold disappear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine continued to stroke her while he waited for her to realize where she was. He was ready to silence her if she tried to call out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe awakening came like a bolt of lightning. The palm of his hand cut off her gasp. \"Now, sweetheart, if you yell, I\u0027ll have to hurt Matthew and Jimbo when they come charging in here,\" he whispered. He rolled her onto her back, then covered her with his body. \"You wouldn\u0027t want that, would you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. Caine slowly eased his hand away from her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re naked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So are you,\" he whispered back. \"Convenient, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he answered. \"And it feels good, doesn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt marvelous. She couldn\u0027t admit that, however. \"How did you get in here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her chin in answer to that question. Jade prodded his shoulder. \"Caine, what are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Impressing you, sweetheart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep your voice down, love,\" he cautioned. \"You don\u0027t want to wake up the boys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They aren\u0027t boys,\" she stammered out. She sounded breathless. The hair on his chest was tickling her breasts, making her ni**les hard. She didn\u0027t want him to move away from her, though, and that honest admission made her frown. Lord, she was confused. \"Impressing me, Caine?\" she whispered. \"I don\u0027t understand what you mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you do, sweet,\" he answered. He kissed the bridge of her nose. \"God, I love your freckles,\" he said with a low groan. He kissed her long, hard, and when he was finished, she was clinging to his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe recovered much quicker than he did. \"Have you come to say goodbye then?\" she asked him in a ragged whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer question was meant to rile him. The defenses again, he thought to himself. \"No, I didn\u0027t come to say goodbye,\" he answered, determined not to get angry. \"I came to make love to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned after making that promise. Jade\u0027s heart started pounding. It was the damned dimple, she told herself. It was too irresistible to ignore . . . and so appeal-ingly boyish. He didn\u0027t feel like a boy, though. No, he had the body of a fit man, a warrior with sleek iron-hard muscles. She couldn\u0027t stop herself from rubbing her toes against his legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someday, my love, you\u0027re going to understand just how much I care for you. You\u0027re my light, my warmth, my other half. I only feel alive when I\u0027m with you. I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her again, then whispered, \"One day, you\u0027ll tell me you love me, too. For now I\u0027ll be content\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto hear you say you want me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. Caine could see the fear in her eyes, the confusion. His smile was filled with tenderness when he pushed her legs apart and settled himself between her silky thighs. He rubbed his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehard arousal against her softness. \"You do want me, love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes with a telling sigh. Caine nibbled at her lips, tugging on her lower lip until she finally opened for him, then thrust his tongue inside to duel with hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caine, what are you . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe silenced her with another long kiss, then whispered, \"It\u0027s called pillaging, Jade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry would be proud,\" he drawled out. His mouth was now placing wet kisses on the smooth, sensitive skin below her chin. She couldn\u0027t quit trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re mine, Jade. The sooner you understand that, the better it will be for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then what, Caine?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted his head to stare down into her eyes. He could see the fear there, and the vulnerability. \"You learn to trust me,\" he whispered. \"And then we live happily ever after.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one lives happily ever after.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"Get off me, Caine. You\u0027re . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Solid, love,\" he interrupted. \"Steadfast, too. I won\u0027t leave you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe promise was given in a fervent whisper. She pretended not to understand. \"Of course you won\u0027t leave me. I\u0027m leaving you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you, Jade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes filled with tears. \"You\u0027ll get tired of me. I won\u0027t change, not for you, not for anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widened. \"All right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"If you want to stay a thief, so be it. I won\u0027t get tired of you, no matter what you do. And I\u0027ll never leave you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t be able to help it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine kissed her brow, then said, \"I can see it\u0027s going to take a little time for me to convince you. Will you give me at least two months?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caine, I don\u0027t think . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You owe me, Jade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I what?\" She sounded outraged. \"Why would you believe I owe you anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you deceived me,\" he explained. \"You caused me endless worry, too. And there I was, minding my own affairs that night in the tavern when you . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I also saved your brother,\" she interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then there\u0027s the issue of my wounded pride, of course,\" he drawled out. \"A man shouldn\u0027t be made to feel he\u0027s been manipulated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caine, for heaven\u0027s sake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Promise me you\u0027ll stay with me for two more months or I\u0027m going to make so much noise when I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epillage you, both Matthew and Jimbo will come running.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat odious threat got her full attention. The determined look in his eyes told her he meant what he threatened, too. \"You should be ashamed of yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Promise me, Jade. Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice had risen and she clamped her hand over his mouth in retaliation. \"Will you explain how you settled on two months instead of one, or three, or . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. She feigned irritation. \"And during those two months you\u0027ll probably be dragging me to your bed every single night, won\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will,\" he answered with a grin. \"Do you know, whenever I look at you, I get hard?\" He shifted positions and pressed against her. \"Can you feel how much I want you? You make me ache to be inside you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis honesty made her blush. \"You shouldn\u0027t say things like that,\" she whispered. \"And I shouldn\u0027t listen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You like it,\" Caine told her. His mouth covered hers and his tongue slid inside to taste her again. Jade didn\u0027t protest. She wanted him too much to stop now. She moved against him, then froze when the bed made such a loud, squeaky noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t. . .\" The denial came out with a groan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can,\" he said, his voice a husky caress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe silenced her worries with another kiss while he stoked the fire in her. Jade forgot all about Matthew and Jimbo. Caine was making her burn and all she could concentrate on was finding release from the sweet agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers drove her wild. She was wet, hot, ready, knew she was going to die from the pressure building inside her. Her nails dug into his shoulder blades. She would have shouted for him to come to her if his mouth hadn\u0027t covered hers. Caine kept the torment up until she took him in her hands and tried to bring him inside her. He threw the coverlet off the bed, then followed it down to the floor with Jade protected in his arms. He cushioned the fall, taking most of the force on his back. Jade was sprawled on top of him. She tried to roll to her side, but Caine held her tight. \"Take me inside you now, love,\" he whispered as he pushed her thighs apart to straddle him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was trembling too much to help. Caine took over. He held her by the sides of her h*ps and slowly eased into her. He let out a low groan of raw pleasure. She whimpered at the same moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he was deep within her, he twisted her hair around his hands and pulled her down for another hot kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mating rhythm took over. Caine\u0027s discipline deserted him. His thrusts became more powerful, more determined. \"Take me to heaven again, Jade,\" he whispered when he was about to spill his hot seed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einside her. \"I\u0027ll keep you safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade found her release seconds later. She arched against Caine, squeezed him tight, biting her lip to keep herself from crying out, and then collapsed on top of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face was buried in the crook of his neck. They were both covered with a sheen of perspiration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade tasted his skin with the tip of her tongue while she waited for her heart to slow down. She was too exhausted, too content, to move. Caine held her close. She could feel his heart pounding against her own. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/guardian-angel-crown-s-spies-2/page-33.html","bookId":1791,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:11:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:11:13 PM"}
