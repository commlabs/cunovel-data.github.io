Even then there was still a hot mix of anger and humiliation swirling inside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the heck was wrong with him? I thought people in small towns were supposed to be nice, not act like the son of Satan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found Main Street with no problem, which literally seemed to be the main street. There was the Grant County Library on Mount View, and I reminded myself I needed to get a library card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrocery store options were limited. Foodland, which actually read FOO LAND, brought to you by the missing letter D, was where Douchebag had said it would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front windows were plastered with a missing person\u0027s picture of a girl about my age with long dark hair and laughing eyes. The data below said she\u0027d last been seen over a year ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a reward, but after she\u0027d been missing for that long, I doubted the reward would ever be claimed. Saddened by that thought, I headed inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was a speed shopper, wasting no time strolling aisles. Throwing items into the cart, I realized I\u0027d need more than I thought since we only had the bare necessities at home. Soon, my cart was filled to the rim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Katy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLost in thought, I jumped at the soft female voice and dropped a carton of eggs on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh! I am so sorry! I startled you. I do that a lot.\" Tan arms shot out and she picked up the carton and placed it back on the shelf. She grabbed another one and held it in her slender hands. \"These won\u0027t be cracked.\" I lifted my gaze from the egg carnage slowly oozing bright yolks all over the linoleum floor and was momentarily stunned. My first impression of the girl was that she was too beautiful to be standing in a grocery store with a carton of eggs in her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood out like a sunflower in a field of wheat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone else was a pale comparison. Her dark hair was curly and longer than mine, reaching her waist. She was tall, thin, and her almost perfect features held a certain innocence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reminded me of someone, especially those startling green eyes. I gritted my teeth. What were the odds?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned. \"I\u0027m Daemon\u0027s sister. My name is Dee.\" She placed the undamaged carton of eggs in my cart. \"New eggs!\" She smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daemon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee gestured at a hot-pink purse in the front of her cart. A cell phone was lying on top of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You talked to him about thirty minutes ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou stopped by...asking for directions?\" So the dickhead had a name. Daemon -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eseemed fitting. And of course his sister would be as attractive as him. Why not? Welcome to West Virginia, the land of lost models. I was starting to doubt I was going to fit in here. \"Sorry. I wasn\u0027t expecting anyone to call out my name.\" I paused. \"He called you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" She deftly pulled her cart out of the way of a toddler running amok through the narrow aisle. \"Anyway, I saw you guys move in, and I\u0027ve been meaning to stop by, and when he said you were here, well, I was so excited to meet you I ran over. He told me what you looked liked.\" I could only imagine that description.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCuriosity filled her face as she watched me with her intense green eyes. \"Although, you don\u0027t look anything like he said, but anyway, I\u0027d know who you were. It\u0027s hard not to know pretty much everyone\u0027s face around here.\" I watched a grubby little kid climb up the bread rack. \"I don\u0027t think your brother likes me.\" Her brows furrowed. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your brother - I don\u0027t think he likes me.\" I turned back to the cart, fiddling with a package of meat. \"He wasn\u0027t very...helpful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh no,\" she said and then laughed. I looked at her sharply. \"I\u0027m sorry. My brother is moody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo shit. \"I\u0027m pretty sure that was more than being moody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"He was having a bad day. He\u0027s worse than a girl, trust me. He doesn\u0027t hate you. We\u0027re twins. Even I want to kill him on days that end with a Y. Anyway, Daemon\u0027s kind of rough around the edges. He doesn\u0027t get along with...people.\" I laughed. \"You think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m glad I ran into you here!\" she exclaimed, changing the subject yet again. \"I wasn\u0027t sure if I would\u0027ve been bothering you if I popped over, with you getting settled in and all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it wouldn\u0027t have been a bother.\" I tried to keep up with the conversation. She went from one topic to the next like someone in bad need of Ritalin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should\u0027ve seen me when Daemon said you were our age. I almost ran home to hug him.\" She moved excitedly. \"If I\u0027d known he was going to be so rude to you, I would have been likely to punch him instead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can imagine.\" I grinned. \"I wanted to punch him, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Imagine being the only girl in the neighborhood and stuck with your annoying brother most of the time.\" She glanced over her shoulder, delicate brows creasing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed her gaze. The little boy now had a carton of milk in each hand, which reminded me that I needed milk. \"Be right back.\" I headed over to the refrigerated section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the mother of the child had rounded the corner, yelling, \"Timothy Roberts, you put that back right now! What are you - ?\" The kid stuck out his tongue. Sometimes being around children was the perfect abstinence program. Then again, not like I needed a program. I carried my milk back to where Dee waited, staring at the floor. Her fingers twisted over the handle of her cart, squeezing until her knuckles bleached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Timothy, get right back here this instant!\" The mother grabbed his chubby arm. Strands of hair had escaped her severe bun. \"What did I tell you?\" she hissed. \"You don\u0027t go near them.\" Them? I expected to see someone else. Except it was Dee and...me. Confused, I glanced at the woman. I was shocked to see her dark eyes filled with disgust. Pure revulsion, and behind that, in the way her lips pressed into a hard line and trembled, there was also fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she was staring at Dee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she gathered the squirmy boy into her arms and hurried off, leaving her cart in the middle of the aisle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to Dee. \"What the heck was that about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee smiled, but it was brittle. \"Small town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe locals are weird around here. Don\u0027t pay any attention to them. Anyway, you must be so bored after unpacking and then grocery shopping. That\u0027s like two of the worst things ever. I mean, hell could be devised of those two things. Think of an eternity of unpacking boxes and grocery shopping?\" I couldn\u0027t help grinning as I struggled to keep up with Dee\u0027s nonstop chatter while we finished loading our carts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormally, someone like that would wear me out in five seconds, but the excitement in her eyes and the way she kept rocking back on her heels was sort of contagious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have more stuff to get?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m pretty much done. I really came to catch you and was sucked down the ice cream aisle. It calls to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and looked at my full cart. \"Yeah, I hope I\u0027m done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on then. We can check out together.\" As we waited in the checkout aisle, Dee rattled on, and I forgot about the weird incident in the milk aisle. Dee believed Petersburg needed another grocery store - because this one didn\u0027t carry organic food - and she wanted organic chicken for what she was making Daemon fix her for dinner. After a few minutes I got past the difficulty of keeping up with her and actually started to relax. She wasn\u0027t bubbly, just really... alive. I hoped she rubbed off on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe checkout line moved quicker than it did in larger cities. Once outside, she stopped next to a new Volkswagen and unlocked the trunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice car,\" I commented. They had money, obviously, or Dee had a job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love it.\" She patted the rear bumper. \"It\u0027s my baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoved groceries in the back of my sedan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Katy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\" I twirled the keys around my finger, hoping asshat brother aside, she wanted to hang out later. There was no telling how late Mom was going to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should apologize for my brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing him, I\u0027m sure he wasn\u0027t very nice.\" I sort of felt sorry for her, being that she was related to such a tool. \"It\u0027s not your fault.\" Her fingers twisted around her key ring, and her eyes drifted to mine. \"He\u0027s really overprotective, so he doesn\u0027t take well to strangers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a dog? I almost smiled, but her eyes were wide and she looked genuinely scared I wouldn\u0027t forgive her. Having a brother like him must suck. \"It\u0027s no big deal. Maybe he was just having a bad day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\" She smiled, but it seemed forced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seriously, no worries. We\u0027re good,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks! I\u0027m totally not a stalker. I swear.\" She winked. \"But I\u0027d love to hang out this afternoon. Got any plans?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, I was thinking of tackling the overgrown flower bed in the front. You wanna help?\" Having company might be fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that sounds great. Let me get these groceries home, and I\u0027ll head straight over,\" she said. \"I\u0027m really excited to garden! I\u0027ve never done that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could ask what sort of childhood didn\u0027t include at least the obligatory tomato plant, she\u0027d dashed off to her car and zoomed out of the parking lot. I pushed off my bumper and headed toward the driver\u0027s side. I opened the car door and was about to climb in when the feeling of being watched crept over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes darted around the parking lot, but there was only a man in a black suit and dark sunglasses staring at a missing person\u0027s picture on a community corkboard. All I could think of was Men in Black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing he needed was that little memory-wiper device and a talking dog. I would\u0027ve laughed, except nothing about the man was funny...Especially since he was now staring right back at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little past one that afternoon, Dee knocked on the front door. When I stepped outside, I found her standing near the steps, rolling back on the heels of her wedge sandals. Not what I\u0027d consider \"gardening\" attire. The sun cast a halo around her dark head and she had an impish grin on her face. In that moment, she reminded me of a fairy princess. Or maybe a cracked-out Tinker Bell, considering how hyper she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey.\" I stepped out onto the porch, closing the door quietly behind me. \"My mom\u0027s sleeping.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope I didn\u0027t wake your mom,\" she mock whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"Nah, she\u0027d sleep through a hurricane. It\u0027s happened, actually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee grinned as she sat on the swing. She looked timid, hugging her elbows. \"As soon as I came home with groceries, Daemon ate half a bag of my potato chips, two of my fudge pops, and then half of the peanut butter jar.\" I started laughing. \"Wow. How does he stay so...\" Hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s amazing.\" She pulled her legs up and wrapped her arms around them. \"He eats so much we usually have to run two to three trips a week to the store.\" She looked at me with a sly glint in her eyes. \"Of course, I can eat you out of house and home too. I guess I shouldn\u0027t be talking.\" My envy was almost painful. I wasn\u0027t blessed with a fast metabolism. My hips and butt could attest to that. I wasn\u0027t overweight, but I really hated it when Mom referred to me as\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027curvy.\u0027 \"That\u0027s so not fair. I eat a bag of chips and gain five pounds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re lucky.\" Her easy grin seemed tighter. \"Anyway, you must tell me all about Florida. Never been there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI propped myself up on the porch railing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think nonstop shopping malls and parking lots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, but the beaches. Yeah, it\u0027s worth it for the beaches.\" I loved the heat of the sun on my skin, my toes squishing in the wet sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow,\" Dee said, her gaze darting next door as if she were waiting for someone. \"It\u0027s going to take a lot for you to get used to living here. Adapting can be...hard when you\u0027re out of your element.\" I shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know. It doesn\u0027t seem that bad. Of course when I first found out, I was like, you have got to be kidding me. I didn\u0027t even know this place existed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee laughed. \"Yeah, a lot of people don\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were shocked when we came here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, so you guys aren\u0027t from here either?\" Her laugh died off as her gaze flicked away from mine. \"No, we\u0027re not from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did your parents move here for work?\" Although I had no idea what sort of jobs were around this place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, they work in the city. We don\u0027t see them a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had the distinct impression there was more to it. \"That must be hard. But...a lot of freedom, I guess. My mom is rarely here either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess you understand then.\" A strange, sad look filled her eyes. \"We kind of run our own lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027d think our lives would be more exciting than this, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked wistful. \"Have you ever heard of, be careful what you wish for? I used to think that.\" She toed the swing back and forth, neither of us rushing to fill the ensuing silence. I knew exactly what she meant. I can\u0027t remember how many times I\u0027d lain awake at night and hoped Mom would snap out of it and move on - and welcome West Virginia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDark clouds seemed to roll in out of nowhere, casting a shadow across the yard. Dee frowned. \"Oh no! It looks like we\u0027re going to get one of our famous afternoon rainstorms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey usually last a couple of hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s too bad. I guess we better plan to garden tomorrow instead. Are you available?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure thing.\" Dee shivered in the suddenly chilly air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonder where this storm came from. It seemed to come out of nowhere, didn\u0027t it?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee jumped up from the swing, wiping her hands on her pants. \"Looks that way. Well, I think your mom is up, and I need to wake Daemon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sleeping? That\u0027s a little late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s weird,\" Dee said. \"I\u0027ll be back tomorrow, and we can head to the garden shop.\" Laughing, I slid off the rail. \"Sounds good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great!\" She skipped down the steps and twirled around. \"I\u0027ll tell Daemon you said hi!\" I felt my cheeks turn a fiery red. \"Uh, that won\u0027t be necessary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust me, it is!\" She laughed and then sprinted to the house next door. Joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom was in the kitchen, coffee in hand. As she faced me, steaming brown liquid sloshed over the counter. The innocent look on her face gave it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrabbing a towel, I walked over to the counter. \"She lives next door, her name is Dee, and I ran into her while I was at the grocery store.\" I swiped the towel over the splotches of coffee. \"She has a brother. His name is Daemon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re twins.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twins? Interesting.\" She smiled. \"Is Dee nice, dear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"Yes, Mom, she\u0027s very nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so happy. It\u0027s about time you came out of your shell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t realize I was in a shell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom blew softly and then took a sip, eyeing me over the rim. \"Did you make plans to hang out with her tomorrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would know. You were listening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" She winked. \"I\u0027m your mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is what we do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eavesdropping on conversations?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. How else am I supposed to know what is going on?\" she asked innocently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes and turned to go back into the living room. \"Privacy, Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey,\" she called from the kitchen, \"there is no such thing as privacy.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/obsidian-lux-1/page-2.html","bookId":2165,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:30:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:30:30 PM"}
