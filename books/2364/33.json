They\u0027re having a field day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m worried about the birthday party, Howard. I\u0027ve sent out the invitations. Since all this bad publicity, I\u0027ve been getting nothing but turndowns. The bastards are afraid they might be contaminated. It\u0027s a fiasco.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you suggest?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That we cancel the party.

I\u0027m Lieutenant Mancini. You\u0027re aware that a stenographer is taking down our conversation?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eS: Sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM: And you\u0027ve waived the right to an attorney?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eS: I don\u0027t need no attorney. All I did was find a watch, for Christ\u0027s sake, and they drug me all the way up here like I\u0027m some kind of animal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM: Mr. Shaw, do you know who Philip Adler is?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eS: No. Should I?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM: No one paid you to attack him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eS: I told you - I never heard of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM: The police in Chicago found fifty thousand dollars in cash in you apartment. Where did that money come from?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eS: [No response]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM: Mr. Shaw...?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eS: I won it gambling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM: Where?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eS: At the track...football bets...you know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM: You\u0027re a lucky man, aren\u0027t you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eS: Yeah. I guess so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM: At present, you have a job in Chicago. Is that right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eS: Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM: Did you ever work in New York?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eS: Well, one time, yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM: I have a police report here that says you were operating a crane at a development in Queens that killed a construction foreman named Bill Whitman. Is that correct?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eS: Yeah. It was an accident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM: How long had you been on that job?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eS: I don\u0027t remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM: Let me refresh your memory. You were on that job seventy-two hours. You flew in from Chicago the day before the accident with the crane, and flew back to Chicago two days later. Is that correct?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eS: I guess so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM: According to American Airlines\u0027 records, you flew from Chicago to New York again two days before Philip Adler was attacked, and you returned to Chicago the following day. What was the purpose of such a short trip?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eS: I wanted to see some plays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM: Do you remember the names of the plays you saw?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eS: No. That was awhile ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM: At the time of the accident with the crane, who was your employer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eS: Cameron Enterprises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eM: And who is your employer on the construction job you\u0027re working on in Chicago?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eS: Cameron Enterprises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoward Keller was in a meeting with Lara. For the past hour they had been talking about damage control to offset the bad publicity the company was receiving. As the meeting was about to break up, Lara said, \"Anything else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoward frowned. Someone had told him to tell Lara something, but he could not remember what it was. Oh, well, it\u0027s probably not important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimms, the butler, said, \"There\u0027s a telephone call for you, Mr. Adler. A Lieutenant Mancini.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip picked up the telephone. \"Lieutenant. What can I do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have some news for you, Mr. Adler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it? Did you find the man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d prefer to come up and discuss it with you in person. Would that be all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be there in half an hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip replaced the receiver, wondering what it was that the detective did not want to talk about on the telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Mancini arrived, Simms showed him into the library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Afternoon, Mr. Adler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good afternoon. What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We caught the man who attacked you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did? I\u0027m surprised,\" Philip said. \"I thought you said it was impossible to catch muggers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not an ordinary mugger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip frowned. \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a construction worker. He works out of Chicago and New York. He has a police record - assault, breaking and entering. He pawned your watch, and we got his prints.\" Mancini held up a wrist watch. \"This is your watch, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip stared at it, not wanting to touch it. The sight of it brought back the horrible moment when the man had grabbed his wrist and slashed it. Reluctantly, he reached out and took the watch. He looked at the back of the case where some of the letters had been scratched off. \"Yes. It\u0027s mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Mancini took the watch back. \"We\u0027ll keep this for the moment, as evidence. I\u0027d like you to come downtown tomorrow morning to identify the man in a police lineup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of seeing his attacker again, face-to-face, filled Philip with a sudden fury. \"I\u0027ll be there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The address is One Police Plaza, Room Two-twelve. Ten o\u0027clock?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\" He frowned. \"What did you mean when you said he wasn\u0027t an ordinary mugger?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLieutenant Mancini hesitated. \"He was paid to attack you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhilip was staring at him, bewildered. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to you wasn\u0027t an accident. He got paid fifty thousand dollars to cut you up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe it,\" Philip said slowly. \"Who would pay anyone fifty thousand dollars to cripple me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was hired by your wife.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-stars-shine-down/page-33.html","bookId":2364,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:56 AM"}
