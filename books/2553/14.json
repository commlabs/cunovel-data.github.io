The right wall was glass from waist to ceiling, and looked in on the natal center\u0027s cloning lab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t have to tell you about the sim genome,\" Twerlinger said, then proceeded to do just that. \"As everyone knows, it consists of twenty-two chromosome pairs - one fewer than humans, two fewer than chimps; much of the junk and non-functioning genetic material has been removed, leaving it one of the cleanest mammalian genomes in existence. Sims don\u0027t mate, mainly because we\u0027ve genetically reduced their sex drives to nil; but even if they did, no offspring would be produced because their ova cannot be fertilized.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not have just one sex?\" Romy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because we\u0027re all conditioned to view work as gender specific: We\u0027re comfortable with females cleaning houses, males loading trucks. And SimGen is nothing if not sensitive to the marketplace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why should the females have ovaries at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d rather they didn\u0027t, of course, but we\u0027ve found that a regular hormone cycle is necessary to their accelerated maturation process.\" She waved tobacco-stained fingers at the masked and gowned workers on the far side of the glass. \"New sims are cloned by nuclear transfer from a bank of identical cells, and implanted in a special class of females we call breeders. Breeder sims are as sterile as their sisters, but exist for one purpose: to incubate new sims.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey came to the end of the corridor. Twerlinger pushed through into a much larger space: wide, long, its low ceiling studded with recessed fluorescents. The place was huge - the size of a football field at least, and filled with beds. It might have been the world\u0027s largest homeless shelter except that it was filled with sims instead of humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePregnant sims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God,\" Romy said. \"And you have three floors like this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And two more identical buildings with a fourth under construction. We can\u0027t keep up with the demand. We\u0027ve begun building natal centers abroad now. The one in Poznan is almost complete.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ambled among the beds, arranged in clusters around common areas with sinks and toilets. Twerlinger pointed to partitioning walls rising not quite to the ceiling throughout the space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We divide our breeders up by how far along they are. Early, middle, late gestation: eight months overall.\" She spread her arms. \"OPRR will find nothing to complain about here, Ms. Cadman. Breeders lead lives of pampered ease. They do not do a lick of work their entire lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they engage in labor of another sort.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sniff. \"I suppose you might put it that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the mothers-to-be Romy passed were either napping or lounging together on sofas, watching TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They look bored out of their minds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Breeders are provided excellent nutrition and get adequate exercise,\" the assistant director said as if she hadn\u0027t heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what of labor and delivery?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like to see a delivery? I can guarantee that a number are in progress as we speak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll leave that to the team. But how does labor go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwerlinger shrugged. \"The breeders rarely need sedation, but if they do, they get it. Our breeder sims receive better obstetrical care than a lot of humans, Ms. Cadman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And after delivery?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s usually single offspring, but we\u0027re beginning to have some success with increasing the incidence of twins. Once we perfect that we can double output.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m surprised you don\u0027t simply clone them and incubate them ex-utero.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We tried that. Believe me, we tried that every which way imaginable, but the resultant offspring were much less tractable and far less emotionally stable than the ones gestated in utero. That\u0027s the one thing we guarantee our lessees: stable and dependable workers. So...\" She smiled here, a fleeting flash of yellowed teeth. \"...we do it the old-fashioned way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you still allow a mother to stay with her child?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwerlinger nodded. \"For a year; we find the offspring adapt faster in that year when the breeders are around to help train them. And we encourage all breeders to nurse because that seems to make for healthier and more emotionally stable offspring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We immunize them against the usual diseases. Chimps get polio and hepatitis and HIV, though they don\u0027t develop AIDS. Sims are even more susceptible. Then the offspring are PRC\u0027d and moved on into the dormitories to start their training.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pee-are...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwerlinger touched the nape of Romy\u0027s neck. Her fingers were ice cold. \"Tattooed with their serial number bar code. You\u0027ve seen them, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" She\u0027d just never thought of babies being tattooed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the only way we can accurately monitor inventory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the mothers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Breeders, please. It\u0027s tempting to anthropomorphize them, but we discourage it. Counterproductive, you know. Certain segments of the public get all caught up in their superficial human characteristics - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, they aren\u0027t exactly white rats.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True, but when you come down to it, sims arelivestock , nothing more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomy looked around at the bored, hopeless expressions on the...breeders. \"Nothing more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As for the breeders, after a year with their offspring, they\u0027re rotated back to be impregnated again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRomy ground her teeth, biting back a tirade. She wanted to shout that they were too close to human to be treated as walking, talking incubators, to have their children - not offspring,children!\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- torn from them and then be impregnated again...and again...and again...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she couldn\u0027t let on how she felt. Zero had warned her about that: Never let them know, or your status in OPRR could be compromised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let out the breath she\u0027d been holding. \"That means every twenty months or so - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that\u0027s the cycle. A hearty breeder can go through ten to twelve cycles before she\u0027s retired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or just plain tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat an existence, Romy thought as she looked around at the lethargic breeders. Most sims in her experience tended to be full of life and energy. These seemed barely able to move. And suddenly she knew why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re depressed,\" Romy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwerlinger arched her thin eyebrows. \"I wasn\u0027t aware you had training in sim psychology.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, but I know depression, lady - firsthand and big time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t need any to realize it\u0027s an unavoidable emotional fallout from being repeatedly separated from their children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ridiculous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chimps, orangutans, gorillas - all mourn the loss of a child. Why should sims be any different? In fact they\u0027d bemore likely to mourn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwerlinger sniffed. \"Do animal emotional states fall under OPRR\u0027s aegis?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn\u0027t. They both knew that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisappointed, Romy followed Twerlinger back to her office. She hadn\u0027t found a thing. Maybe the full- team inspection would come up with something, but she\u0027d struck out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found Portero waiting for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finished here?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For now. Research next.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile tried to look sympathetic as he shook his head. \"As I told you, research is scheduled for this afternoon. The dormitories and training centers are next on the list.\" He gave a helpless shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow, helpless didn\u0027t fit with Luca Portero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she followed the security chief back to the Jeep she wondered if the judge had lowered the boom on the sim union yet. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-14.html","bookId":2553,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM"}
