{"id":40424,"no":45,"title":"ACCOMPLICES","content":"“There’s enough time, if we hurry.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Enough time to what?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “To drop by the Uglyville art school. They have bungeejackets in the basement. A whole rack of spares.”\n\u003cbr\u003e David took a deep breath. “Okay.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “You’re not scared, are you?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “I’m not . . .” He grimaced. “It’s just that I’ve never seenthis many people before.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “People? We haven’t seen anyone.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Yeah, but all those houses on the way here. I keepthinking of people living in every single one, all crowdedtogether like that.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally laughed. “You think the burbs are crowded? Waituntil we get to Uglyville.”\n\u003cbr\u003e They headed back, taking the rooftops at top speed. Thesky was pitch-black, but by now Tally could read the starswell enough to know that the first notes of dawn were onlya couple of hours away.\n\u003cbr\u003e Reaching the greenbelt, they turned back the way they’dcome, neither of them speaking, concentrating instead onnavigating through the trees. This arc of the belt broughtthem through Cleopatra Park, where Tally threaded theslalom poles for old times’ sake. Her instincts twitched asthey passed the path down to her old dorm. For a split second,it felt as if she could make the turnoff, climb in throughher window, and go to bed.\n\u003cbr\u003e Soon, the jumbled spires of the Uglyville art school roseup, and Tally brought the two of them to a halt.\n\u003cbr\u003e This part was easy. It seemed like a million years agothat Tally and Shay had borrowed one of the school’sbungee jackets for their final trick, Shay’s leap onto the newuglies in the dorm library. Tally retraced her steps to theexact window they’d jimmied, a dirty, forgotten pane ofglass concealed behind decorative bushes, and found that itwas still unlocked.\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally shook her head. This sort of burglary had seemedso daring two months before. Back then, the library stuntwas the wildest prank she and Shay could dream up. Nowshe saw tricks for what they were: a way for uglies to blowoff steam until they reached sixteen, nothing but a meaninglessdistraction until their mutinous natures were erasedby adulthood, and the operation.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Give me the flashlight. And wait here.”\n\u003cbr\u003e She slipped in, found the rack of spares, grabbed twobungee jackets, and was out in less than a minute. When360 Scott Westerfeldshe pulled herself out of the window, she found David staringat her with wide eyes. “What?” she asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e “You’re just so . . . good at all this. So confident. Itmakes me nervous just being inside city limits.”\n\u003cbr\u003e She grinned. “This is no big deal. Everyone does it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Still, Tally was happy to impress David with her burglaryskills. In the last few weeks he’d taught her how tobuild a fire, scale a fish, pitch a tent, and read a contourmap. It was nice to be the competent one for a change.\n\u003cbr\u003e They crept back to the greenbelt and reached the riverbefore the sky had even shown a sliver of pink. Zoomingpast the white water and onto the vein of ore, they sightedthe ruins just as the sky was beginning to change.\n\u003cbr\u003e On the hike down, Tally asked, “Tomorrow night, then?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “No point in waiting.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “No.” And there was every reason to attempt the rescuesoon. It had been more than two weeks since the invasionof the Smoke.\n\u003cbr\u003e David cleared his throat. “So, how many Specials doyou think will be in there?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “When I was there, a lot. But that was during the day. Iassume they have to sleep sometime.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “So it’ll be empty at night.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “I doubt that. But maybe just a few guards.” She didn’tsay more. Even one Special would be more than a matchfor a pair of uglies. No amount of surprise would makeup for the cruel pretties’ superior strength and reflexes.\n\u003cbr\u003e UGLIES 361“We’ll just have to make sure they don’t see us.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Sure. Or hope they’ve got something else to do thatnight.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally trudged ahead, exhaustion taking over now thatthey were safely out of the city, her confidence ebbing withevery step. They’d traveled all this way without thinkingvery hard about the task ahead of them. Rescuing peoplefrom Special Circumstances wasn’t just another ugly-trick,like stealing a bungee jacket or sneaking up the river. It wasserious business.\n\u003cbr\u003e And although Croy, Shay, Maddy, and Az were probablyall prisoners in those horrible underground buildings, therewas always the possibility that the Smokies had been takensomewhere else. And even if they hadn’t, Tally had no ideaexactly where they’d be inside the warren of puke-brownhallways.\n\u003cbr\u003e “I just wish we had some help,” she said softly.\n\u003cbr\u003e David’s hand settled on her shoulder, bringing her to ahalt. “Maybe we do.”\n\u003cbr\u003e She looked at him questioningly, then followed his gazedown toward the ruins. At the top of the highest spire, thelast few flickers of a safety sparkler were sputtering out.\n\u003cbr\u003e There were uglies down there.\n\u003cbr\u003e “They’re looking for me,” he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e “So what do we do?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Is there any other way back to the city?” David asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e “No. They’ll come hiking right up this path.”\n\u003cbr\u003e 362 Scott Westerfeld“Then we wait.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally squinted, peering at the ruins. The sparkler hadfaded, and nothing was visible in the dawn light just startingto spill across the sky. Whoever was down there hadwaited until the last possible minute to head for home.\n\u003cbr\u003e Of course, if they were looking for David, these uglieswere potential runaways. Rebellious seniors, not that worriedabout missing breakfast.\n\u003cbr\u003e She turned to David. “So, I guess uglies are still lookingfor you. And not just here.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Of course,” he said. “The rumors will go on for generations,in cities all over, whether I’m around or not. Lightinga sparkler doesn’t usually get an answer, so it’ll be a longtime before even the uglies I’ve met figure out I’m notshowing up. And most of them already don’t even think theSmoke—”\n\u003cbr\u003e His voice caught, and Tally took his hand. For amoment he’d forgotten that the Smoke didn’t, in fact, existanymore.\n\u003cbr\u003e They waited in silence, until the sound of scramblingfeet came across the rocks. It sounded like three or souglies, talking in low tones as if still wary of the ghosts ofthe Rusty ruins.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Watch this,” David whispered, pulling a flashlightfrom his pocket. He stood and pointed the light up at hisown face, switching it on.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Looking for me?” he said in a loud, commanding voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e UGLIES 363The three uglies froze, wide-eyed and open-mouthed.\n\u003cbr\u003e Then the boy dropped his board, and it crashed onto thestones beside him, breaking their paralysis.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Who are you?” one of the girls managed.\n\u003cbr\u003e “I’m David.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh. You mean you’re . . .”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Real?” He switched off the light and grinned. “Yeah, Iget that question a lot.”\n\u003cbr\u003e Their names were Sussy, An, and Dex, and they had beencoming to the ruins for a month now. They’d heard rumorsabout the Smoke for years, since an ugly in their dorm hadrun away.\n\u003cbr\u003e “I’d just moved to Uglyville,” Sussy said, “and Ho was asenior. When he disappeared, everyone had these crazytheories about where he’d gone.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Ho?” David nodded. “I remember him. He stayed for afew months, then changed his mind and came back. Bynow, he’s a pretty.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “But he really made it? To the Smoke?” An asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Yeah. I took him there.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Wow. So it’s real.” An shared an excited look with hertwo friends. “We want to see it too.”\n\u003cbr\u003e David opened his mouth, then closed it. His eyes driftedaway to one side.\n\u003cbr\u003e “You can’t,” Tally spoke up. “Not right now.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “Why not?” Dex asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e 364 Scott WesterfeldTally paused. The truth, that the Smoke had beendestroyed by an armed invasion, seemed too far-fetched. Afew months ago, she wouldn’t have believed what her owncity was capable of. And if she admitted that the Smoke wasgone, the rumor would make its way down through generationsof uglies. Dr. Cable’s work would be complete, even ifa few rescued Smokies somehow managed to create anothercommunity in the wild. “Well,” she started, “every so oftenthe Smoke has to move, to stay secret. Right now, it doesn’treally exist. Everyone’s scattered, so we’re not recruiting.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “The whole place moves?” Dex said. “Whoa.”\n\u003cbr\u003e An frowned. “Hang on. If you’re not recruiting, thenwhy are you here?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “To do a trick,” Tally said. “A really big one. Maybe youcould help us. And then when the Smoke is back on its feet,you’ll be the first to know.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “You want us to help? Like an initiation?” Dex asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e “No,” David said firmly. “We don’t make anyone doanything to get into the Smoke. But if you do want to help,Tally and I would appreciate it.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “We just need a diversion,” Tally said.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Sounds like fun,” An said. She looked at the others,and they waggled their heads.\n\u003cbr\u003e Up for anything, Tally thought, just like she used to beherself. They were definitely seniors, less than a year behindher, but she was amazed at how young they seemed.\n\u003cbr\u003e David stared at Tally along with the others, waiting forUGLIES 365the rest of her idea. She had to come up with a diversionright away. A good one. Something that would intrigue theSpecials enough to investigate.\n\u003cbr\u003e Something that would make Dr. Cable herself takenotice.\n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, you’ll need a lot of sparklers.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “No problem.”\n\u003cbr\u003e “And you know how to get into New Pretty Town,right?”\n\u003cbr\u003e “New Pretty Town?” An looked at her friends. “But don’tthe bridges report everyone who crosses the river?”\n\u003cbr\u003e Tally smiled, always happy to teach someone a newtrick.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1847/53577.html","bookId":974,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 1:02:53 PM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 1:02:53 PM"}
