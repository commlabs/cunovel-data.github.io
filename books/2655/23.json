He spun me around until I was dizzy. \"You ... you were brilliant!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the sword... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will still find it, Katerina. And without Ankh-al-Sekhem\u0027s meddling.\" He placed me gently back on my own two feet. Danilo\u0027s face grew serious. \"You will make a wonderful tsarina, my love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled out of his arms, uncomfortable that I\u0027d noticed how muscular they were. \"I never wanted to be tsarina. All I ever wanted was to be a doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanilo laughed again. \"Such a small imagination you have. Do you not realize you could conjure up all the ancient teachers of medicine-Hippocrates, Galen, even da Vinci-and have them at your command?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How ridiculous! I don\u0027t want to study ancient medicine. I need to know the latest in research. I need to study at a real medical university!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an instant, the friendliness was gone from Danilo\u0027s face. The lich tsar had returned and was in complete control of the crown prince. He grabbed my arm painfully. \"You need to remember that you are my betrothed, Katerina. You will act accordingly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore angry now than afraid, I decided to push back. \"You have to be strong, Danilo,\" I shouted. \"You cannot let Konstantin win.\" I searched his face and held my breath. His eyes were still a murky hazel as the two people battled within the same body. Finally, the crown prince\u0027s eyes resumed their normal black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded toward the road. \"We need to get out of here. The Grigori could arrive at any minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn all of the excitement of being attacked by an evil mummy, I\u0027d forgotten about the Grigori. \"If they don\u0027t have the sword, how can Papus and the Order of the Black Lily command the Grigori to chase after us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled his eyes. \"The same way I have persuaded the Grigori to be loyal to me. The promise of freedom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they believed you?\" I asked. \"What will they do when they discover you lied to them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanilo shrugged, but I was no longer sure if it was the crown prince or the lich tsar I was looking at. \"By then I will possess the sword and they will have no choice but to obey. There is no way to free them. The sword is not of this world and cannot be destroyed. Nor can the Grigori touch it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could not believe the Grigori would be so naive. I foresaw only more trouble and misfortune ahead once we found this cursed sword. I looked up and down the dirt road, wishing desperately for a hat to keep the sun out of my eyes. There was nothing for miles in either direction but shimmering mirages. \"Which way are we to go?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This way,\" Danilo said as he headed toward a temple complex. We wandered through the necropolis, Danilo muttering to himself as the hot wind swept stinging sands around us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there another necromancer we are to meet today?\" I asked. I was tired and famished. I had lost track of the days since I\u0027d been abducted and was not even sure of the last time I\u0027d had a decent night\u0027s sleep. The adventure had become one strange and endless nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No more necromancers today,\" Danilo said with a mirthless laugh. The crown prince stopped in front of a battered statue of a sphinx. This was not the famous monster at Giza but a much smaller version. I\u0027d always loved the two sphinxes that adorned the waterfront of the Imperial Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg. The teachers at Smolni enjoyed taking students to the Academy and telling us the story of how the sphinxes had been brought from Egypt to Russia in the seventeen hundreds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis sphinx was human-sized. She sat like a cat on her back haunches, her head held high regally like a queen. Her right front paw was missing. She appeared to be guarding a very plain stone building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched Danilo as he approached the statue quietly. He went down on one knee, with his right hand over his heart. \"My lady,\" he whispered. \"I have come to you seeking wisdom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stone creature\u0027s eyes opened. \"You are a strange one. More of a puzzle than I,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sphinx had come to life. I could scarcely believe my eyes. Or indeed, my ears. The voice was young and feminine, slow and deliberate. There was no cold light surrounding her, but my own cold light seemed to shy away from her. As for Danilo, his brilliant cold light strands clung to him, as if in fear of her. How very odd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanilo smiled. \"I am a riddle as well, my lady. Answer my question and I will answer yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You seek the Morning Star.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You believe I can help you.\" The sphinx\u0027s voice gave me chills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, my lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you will answer my question when I have answered yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanilo did not move. \"Where will I find the Morning Star?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sphinx blinked. \"Past the seven gates of heaven, the Morning Star lies, betwixt the steadfast darkness and the unfailing light.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I seek the sword known as the Morning Star,\" Danilo clarified, doing his best to sound patient and humble, but I could sense his irritation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I have given you the key to find your sword,\" the sphinx repeated. \"Now you must answer my question. What sort of creature are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you have not answered mine!\" Danilo shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is a lich!\" I said quickly. I had no desire to see what an angry sphinx could do to us. \"A blood drinker who has possessed another\u0027s body. They share one body, my lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanilo glared at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most curious,\" the sphinx said. \"But you did not ask me a question. And I did not ask one of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg your pardon, my lady.\" I felt compelled to kneel down on the hard-packed sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis seemed to appease the sphinx. \"But you have given me the answer that I sought. And so I shall give you an answer that you seek. That answer is yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no idea what question she was answering. But her yes gave me a faint sliver of hope. \"Yes\" meant possibility. It meant I might survive my journey with Danilo. That I might see George again, if the sphinx could indeed see the future. What other questions did I have except for ones regarding my future? \"Thank you, my lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanilo stood up. \"This has been a waste of time. Let\u0027s go.\" He jerked me up by the arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are we going to get back to Cairo?\" I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Follow the Morning Star,\" the sphinx growled. And her stone eyes closed at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanilo cursed under his breath. \"She delights in making men mad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me more about the sphinx,\" I said, curiosity getting the better of me. \"Was she ever a mortal woman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Danilo was walking quickly back toward the road. He took a pocket watch out of his vest and consulted it with a frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So who was she? When did she live?\" I stumbled over some rocks as I tried to keep up with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Later, Duchess. We must hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the road in despair. \"We cannot walk all the way back to Cairo. It must be miles from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And across the river.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the road was already touching civilization, and we began to pass beggars and children and stray dogs. I\u0027d given away all of my coins in Alexandria, but Danilo shrugged off the cries of the villagers without a second glance. I stopped when I saw a young wisp of a mother with a screaming and dirty infant in her lap. \"Does the baby need medicine?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman stared at me blankly, not understanding French or English. I tried Greek as well. Finally I sighed and placed my pearl earrings in her hand, closing her fingers around them. \"For the baby,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed my hand and kissed it, chattering in a language I did not recognize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanilo turned around to see what I\u0027d done and rolled his eyes. \"Forget the beggars, Katerina. We must hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTraveling north along the road, we soon came to the recognizable Giza Plateau. The electric tramline began here, taking tourists from the most famous of the Egyptian pyramids back to the comfort of Cairo. A former royal lodge, the Mena House Hotel sat near the tram station. This luxury hotel was run by a wealthy English couple who\u0027d done little to alter the royal furnishings and decor but included every convenience a sophisticated traveler could possibly desire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanilo sighed as the hotel came into view. \"About bloody time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think the Grigori know where we are?\" I asked. \"At this point, Duchess, I honestly do not care. We are checking in and I am taking a hot bath. I suggest you do the same.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-morning-star-katerina-3/page-23.html","bookId":2655,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:15 AM"}
