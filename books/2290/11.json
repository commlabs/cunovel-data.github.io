But he was stabilizing, and he appeared to be in better shape than Mary had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t leave him; not for a minute,\" Sean ordered his officer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not even to take a leak, I mean it. I\u0027ve got Howlett down the hallway. Call him if you need a break.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir,\" George Mendez promised. He was new to the force and a quietly practicing Catholic. Sean had chosen him for exactly that reason. He\u0027d seemed to take it in stride, no questions asked, when Sean had hung a crucifix around David\u0027s neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, he\u0027d seen Mendez fingering the large silver cross he wore himself, usually beneath his uniform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir?\" Mendez asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did they make a mistake? Was the girl alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mendez, right now, we don\u0027t know what went down. A body is missing, and a young man has suffered serious blood loss. For all I know, it could be a sick fraternity prank. Anyway, until we know more, we say nothing. Howlett will be keeping away the press and the just plain curious. But I want one of you with this young man at all times. I\u0027ve informed the staff that not even the doctors are to draw a curtain against you, got it? If he needs a bedpan, you\u0027re still right here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir. I won\u0027t let you down, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean nodded and started down the hall. Howlett stopped him. \"The press is outside,\" he warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean straightened his spine and headed out to meet the enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePraying that she had made an impression on Jeremy and Nancy earlier, and that she wasn\u0027t too late if she hadn\u0027t, Jessica raced to her office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe banged on the door. \"Jeremy, let me in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited, somehow sensing that he was in terrible danger. She winced as she stood there, fearful his good heart would be his downfall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fumbled for her key, finally got it into the lock, then rushed through the door and ran to the inner office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she burst in, Jeremy, who had been facing the window, turned at last. He blinked, staring at her stupidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was...sleeping,\" he said, sounding confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica went to him and grabbed him by the shoulders trying to shake him into awareness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can never-never-let her in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But...it was Mary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNancy began to stir at last. \"I thought I heard banging. It was so strange. I thought I heard-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe broke off, staring from Jeremy to Jessica.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy continued to face Jessica, his features drawn and taut, his eyes filled with sorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was Mary,\" he repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica lowered her lashes, shaking her head. Then she looked up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing from strip club to strip club was probably not something that most men would consider an onerous task, but the tension gripping Bryan was so tight that he couldn\u0027t even summon a pretense of normal courtesy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, he didn\u0027t want a lap dance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, it wasn\u0027t the price.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, he wasn\u0027t gay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was just that there was only one woman who interested him, and comparing her to anyone else was like comparing the elegance of silk, the electricity of a lightning storm, to raw linen and a pale dawn. Last night...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut right now, he had to find Mary. He wondered if he was wasting his time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, at last, he found her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was one of the tawdrier places, off the beaten track. The bouncers were big, but flabby. The shine was worn off the poles, the runway carpets threadbare. The girls looked to be older than the usual and, like the bouncers, less than perfectly fit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil Mary made her appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d picked up some kind of apparel-if it could be called that-backstage. Bryan gritted his teeth, wondering how she\u0027d acquired it, but he had a feeling she hadn\u0027t made any further attacks. There were no private dressing rooms in this establishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, she was waiting to take a customer into one of the little curtained alcoves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe strutted down the runway as if she\u0027d been born to it. She had the naughty schoolgirl look that was such a come-on to some men. She had a smile that was a sheer tease, full of forbidden promises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe posed, teased, tempted. She practically had sex with the pole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoney was flying; men were roaring. She began to offer her services for lap dances. One man offered a thousand dollars. Hoots and jeers filled the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary assessed the double-chinned businessman, and a smile of disdain touched her lips before she wetted them with her tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" she whispered, and beckoned to him, starting backstage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man nearly tripped over himself running after her. Discreetly, Bryan followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was darkness. A very strange darkness. Not like ebony, not like a blackout. Officer Mendez couldn\u0027t have said exactly when he began to notice it, because it was subtle. It was as if a shadow had descended. Not a real shadow, nothing with a shape or definable edges, just a strange, new sense andfeel of darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOfficer Mendez knew his duty. Pure terror began to rip through him, but he had vowed he wouldn\u0027t leave, and he wouldn\u0027t. He fought his fear and approached the young man on the bed. He touched the boy\u0027s crucifix, then noticed that the pillow was oddly damp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly water? Had the lieutenant actually sprinkled the young man\u0027s pillow with holy water?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease, yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMendez curled his fingers around the silver cross that protected his own throat. He began to pray aloud. \"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt as if he were being strangled. As if the shadow had taken on a physical form and was attacking him, reaching for him....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will fear no evil,\" he continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes for a minute, afraid he was about to lose it completely and go tearing out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought he heard laughter, it was gone as quickly as it had come. With it went the shadow, the sensation of cold. Gone as if it had never been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had broken out into a cold sweat, and he was shaking, but now he began to breathe more easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it came again. The laughter. He placed his hands over his ears, never thinking for a second to reach for his firearm. He knew it would be useless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will fear no evil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain the laughter drifted away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time it stayed gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMendez sank into the visitor\u0027s chair at the foot of the bed and looked around nervously. Nothing appeared to have changed. He thanked God he hadn\u0027t given in to his fear, thanked God he hadn\u0027t run screaming down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sank to his knees and humbly begged God never to be given this assignment again. He was newly married, with a baby on the way. He had to live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stayed on his knees as the night progressed, wondering if he dared try to explain to Detective Canady that there had been a shadow in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that he was afraid it would come back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe curtain drew closed behind the businessman. Bryan took a quick look around; there were other curtains, providing privacy for whatever went on in the alcoves. There was nothing he could do. She had to be stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wrenched aside the curtain just in time to see the overeager fat man kneeling on the floor, blubbering like a two-year-old. His eyes were wide, his toupee askew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary stood over him, telling him to shut up and bare his throat, and though he shook and gasped for breath, he didn\u0027t have the will to deny her. He was like a bleeding diver in a chummed sea, watching the approach of a great white, knowing he was about to be bitten in half. He could see his life-and his death-all at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary hissed as the drapery opened and stared at Bryan. For a moment he could see the sudden sharp growth of her canines, could see what the fat man could see, the promise of death, as surely as if the fangs belonged to a deadly asp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew out a vial of holy water, thrice blessed, and doused her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe screamed. A terrible scream, like a banshee crying out, and there was the terrible smell of burning flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fat man cried out, ducking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary doubled over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryan moved, ready to deliver the coup de grace. But the fat man suddenly screamed again, leaping to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in those seconds Mary found the will to survive. She whirled with the speed of light and burst away from the alcove and the curtain. Someone screamed in her path, and people went flying, landing hard against the runway, where a nearly naked woman was doing a come-on with a bull whip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone in the place was suddenly standing, and fists were flying wildly. It had all happened in just seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwearing, Bryan leapt over the still screaming and blubbering fat man. He thrust out an arm, pushing his way through the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary had escaped into a back alley. He did the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica stayed with Nancy and Jeremy until the sun began to rise. By then Jeremy seemed to have made a major change. He grew calm, no longer so shattered. He was quiet and pensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s safe to leave by day, isn\u0027t it?\" he asked Jessica.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated. \"I don\u0027t really-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe broke off; he was staring at her with something close to contempt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do know,\" he said quietly. \"I don\u0027t know how you know, but you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared back at him. \"You\u0027re probably safe by daylight,\" she said at last. Then she shrugged and started across the room, taking a seat at her desk and staring at them. \"Don\u0027t believe the legend that vampires can\u0027t move about by day. They can, and they need only sleep near or with a few granules of their native soil. They don\u0027t like sunlight, but it won\u0027t kill them, and too much saltwater, not just holy water, can kill them. What else? A really powerful vampire can make you forget just about anything. And a really powerful vampire can twist most people to his or her will without even looking them in the eyes.\" She paused again. The kids had worried that everyone would think they were crazy. Now they probably thoughtshe was totally insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t talk about this, if I were you. If you try to convince other people that vampires are real, they\u0027ll probably find a way to lock you up. Maybe we all deny what we\u0027re afraid to believe, I don\u0027t know. The point is...\" She gritted her teeth and leaned forward. \"The point is, there is a particularly powerful vampire known as the Master. He\u0027s just about as evil as sin itself. He has appeared many times throughout history. He was dormant for many years, and I actually believed he might have been destroyed, but...anyway, I believe he followed Mary here. So it\u0027s not just Mary walking the streets of New Orleans. There\u0027s far worse out there,\" she finished softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you a slayer, then? Are there really such things?\" Jeremy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lowered her lashes, shaking her head. \"No. I\u0027m not a slayer. I simply try to stop them from killing, from making more of their kind. Sadly, I failed to save Mary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know about this...Master?\" Jeremy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s been around before,\" she said simply. \"I went to the conference in Romania hoping to hear rumors of vampire activity. As usual, there was lots of talk about cults and people who think they need to suck blood, but in all that hot air, you can usually find some glimmer of truth or catch wind of one of the parties the Master has started hosting as his personal feast. He likes to pick and choose. Mary was quite beautiful,\" she added softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is insane,\" Nancy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course it sounded insane. They\u0027d insisted they\u0027d seen vampires without having any idea of what that really meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wanted the truth. I\u0027ve given it to you. You\u0027ll need to protect yourselves at all times. Especially if I\u0027m right and the Master is here, planning one of his parties.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was surprised when Nancy said, \"The sad thing is, I believe you.\" Her voice turned to a whisper. \"I was there. And I know that you\u0027re telling the truth. I just want it to be insane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly Jeremy sprang to life and shook his head. \"But...the whole city needs to be warned. The entire state. Hell, the world!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica sighed. \"Don\u0027t you understand? You can\u0027t go creating panic, or a situation in which you condemn those who can fight the evil to being stuck in a mental ward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNancy looked at Jeremy. \"We need to go. We can help our friends, at the very least. We can hand out crosses to our friends. We can ask them to wear them in memory of Mary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to suggest you come back here tonight,\" Jessica said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But our friends-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You two are the ones he wants. He\u0027ll be angry with Mary, because she wasn\u0027t able to seduce you into letting her in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he hurts her-\" Jeremy began angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeremy,\" Nancy said, taking his arm, \"she\u0027s dead. The Mary we know is dead. Isn\u0027t that true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain Jessica looked down, wondering what to say. She lifted her head and stared up at the two of them. \"The Master is evil-excessively cruel. I\u0027m afraid that Mary, who is now his creature, isn\u0027t at all the person you once knew. She\u0027ll sound like the woman you knew and loved, but she is his to command. Jeremy, you have to be strong. Strong for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean, so I can kill her,\" he said bitterly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If need be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I can-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have no idea what you\u0027re up against. You have to keep yourself safe and let me know any time she comes. Do you understand?\" She hesitated. \"Jeremy, the Master hates me, and he will try especially hard to hurt the two of you, because he knows we\u0027ve grown close. He\u0027ll target some people for his amusement, but others...\" She trailed off, not certain how much to say. \"I believe the Master is intent on ruining my life, hurting those I care about. You have to be strong, Jeremy. You have to resist Mary, no matter how hard that is. Do you understand? She intends to kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNancy was frowning, but she clearly comprehended that they were in serious danger. \"He understands.\" Nancy said firmly. \"I\u0027ll see to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go,\" Jeremy said dully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be back before dark,\" Jessica warned them firmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy looked at her, troubled. \"Why does he want to hurt you so badly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a very long story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited. She remained quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" he said softly. \"I\u0027m going to assume you had something to do with the fact that he was...gone for so long. So you need to be careful, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will be,\" she vowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the two of them were gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned back and folded her hands in her lap. After a moment, she murmured aloud, \"That didn\u0027t go too badly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath. Then she started to cancel her appointments for the week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept for one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean leaned his head wearily against the back of his chair, momentarily closing his eyes. Maybe the aspirin would kick in soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a night, and what a horrendous beginning to the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d already had to make the call to Mary\u0027s parents to tell them that their daughter\u0027s body had disappeared. At the hospital, there were two rumors going around. One claimed that a psychotic necrophiliac had stolen the body. Then there was the suggestion-taken more seriously by most-that the girl had never been dead, that the doctor on call had made a horrible mistake, and she had simply awakened, perhaps suffering some memory loss, and had grabbed some clothes from somewhere and headed out to the streets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d also had to arrange for constant surveillance of Dave where he lay in the hospital, and he had to make sure he chose the right men for the job. The days were easy enough, but the nights were murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he was being told that Bryan MacAllistair was waiting to see him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Send him in,\" Sean told the desk clerk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacAllistair entered the room and just stood there imposingly, waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I do for you?\" Sean demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacAllistair looked worn, exhausted. \"Come clean,\" he said, taking a seat at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean groaned. \"Come clean? You\u0027re a fine one to insist on honesty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I almost had her,\" MacAllistair said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacAllistair shook his head. \"The way I see it, you know damned well I was in the morgue. Jessica must have called you by now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean leaned forward. \"So, what the hell were you doing in the morgue?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA humorless smile curved the man\u0027s lips. \"Trying to stop a vampire,\" he said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean was shocked into silence, though he shouldn\u0027t have been, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a vampire now. I tracked her down in one of the strip clubs. I almost had her, but she got away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean blinked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacAllistair\u0027s grim smile deepened as he leaned forward. \"I don\u0027t know what the hell is going on here, but I will find out. I think you know as well as I do that there\u0027s a vampire loose in the city. I intend to stop it. I can help you, you can help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacAllistair rose. Sean fought to control his temper as MacAllistair spoke again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call me if you need me. I promise I\u0027ll call you. Thanks for your time. I thought I should let you know I almost had her. I\u0027d be watching my back tonight, if I were you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, he nodded a goodbye and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Son of a bitch!\" Sean swore. \"I should have arrested him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor what? He asked himself. Knowing the truth?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStacey was at the house, along with Gareth. She seemed relieved to see Jessica.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Jessica walked up the steps, she surveyed the work being done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrings of garlic, dressed up with flowers, were hanging everywhere. There were containers of holy water and other religious symbols as if they had gotten their holidays confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice job,\" she said dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You all right?\" Gareth asked tensely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe offered him a weary smile. \"Just fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve heard all the news,\" Stacey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I imagine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, she\u0027s...gone?\" Stacey asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica nodded. \"I\u0027m going to lie down for a while. Get a little rest. If everything is all right here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got it covered,\" Gareth assured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated, about to head inside. \"Have you seen Bryan MacAllistair?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Stacey said, frowning and looking at Gareth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head solemnly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica lowered her head, letting out a sigh of exhaustion. \"I\u0027ve got to catch a few minutes of sleep. We\u0027ll talk later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem,\" Stacey replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica walked through the front door and up the stairs to her room. In the hallway, she stopped, tempted to slip into his room and go through his things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was so tired, but it suddenly felt necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced around, though she knew she was alone in the house, then took out her master key and slipped into his room, locking the door behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared around the room. Neat and tidy. His computer was on the desk. There were no papers beside it. In the closet, there were two dress jackets, shoes, a windbreaker and a few good shirts. She walked quickly to the dresser. T-shirts, boxers and flannel pajama bottoms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrustrated, she closed the drawer and moved back to the computer. She turned it on and scanned his files. Nothing of interest. The computer was either brand-new, or everything was encrypted in someway she didn\u0027t have time to figure out. She connected to the Internet, anxious to view his past searches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartled, she swallowed and stepped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she gritted her teeth, telling herself she was a fool to be nervous. Of course he had looked up everything to do with vampires. Naturally some of the sites he had found discussed interesting cases revolving around vampirism. Naturally some of those cases involved her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought she heard a sound in the hall. She turned off the computer, stepped back, froze and listened. Nothing. She was just so tired that she was hearing things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped out of his room, locking the door in her wake. Down the hall, she entered her own room. Good Lord, but she was exhausted. She kicked off her shoes, pulled her shirt over her head and shed her skirt, letting everything fall on the floor as she headed into the bathroom. She let the shower pour down on her long and hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust two nights ago she had been in heaven. And now...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho the hell was he and what the hell had he been doing there? He\u0027d had a stake!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd where the hell was he now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had stirred such deep emotions in her. Awakened feelings she hadn\u0027t known in forever. He had reminded her so much of...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was gone. Dead. What could never be again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrapped in her robe, she strode back out to the bedroom, threw herself down on the bed and staring up at the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly then did she realize she wasn\u0027t alone in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At last.\" came the deep voice, barely a whisper on the breeze. \"At last. I\u0027ve been waiting for you, you know.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/kiss-of-darkness-alliance-vampires-7/page-11.html","bookId":2290,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:40 PM"}
