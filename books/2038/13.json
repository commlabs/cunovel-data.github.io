Every ounce of him was charged and ready, that muscled body in a fighter\u0027s stance. His dark eyes held a hard, savage expression as he assessed for threats. He was magnificent. He looked as though he could have single-handedly torn apart an army then and there. I wrapped my arms around myself, from neither coldness nor modesty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was walking up your driveway and felt something...something dark.\" His body relaxed, the animal fierceness in his eyes replaced by that smoky sensuality as he seemed to notice for the first time that I was naked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A Gray Man. He had to go keep an appointment with Persephone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo\u0027s lips twitched into a smile. \"Were you in the shower?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sauna. I impaled him with a mirror.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stared at each other, a thick tension building up in the air between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" I said finally. \"Thanks for checking in. You can leave now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eugenie - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy confusion and lust took their rightful backseat to my indignation. \"I have nothing to say to you. I don\u0027t want to say anything to you. Get out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not until I\u0027ve explained everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what? How you wanted to get me pregnant, just like everyone else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked, clearly surprised. \"I - what? No. Of course not. For Christ\u0027s sake, I used a condom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I know. I was there.\" I could hear the irrational sulkiness in my voice. \"Why else would you have done it, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes traveled from my face down my entire body, and then back to my face. \"Why do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed, attempting to ignore the warmth left from where his gaze had touched me. \"Okay. I get the mechanics of it. But you can\u0027t sit there and tell me you being in that bar was a coincidence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. It wasn\u0027t,\" he said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited for more. \"That\u0027s it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed and leaned against the wall. \"I was asked by a friend to find you and mark you so we could keep track of you. I didn\u0027t know why; I had no idea who you were at the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Someone told you to sleep with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er, no. That was my own, um, improvisation. I could have marked you other ways.\" He smiled meaningfully. \"But you were too charming and pretty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey! Don\u0027t use that fox sex magic on me. It\u0027s already caused enough trouble. Who told you to do that? To mark me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flirtatious smile disappeared. Silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, you\u0027re supposed to be the big honesty advocate. If you aren\u0027t going to play that way anymore, then I\u0027m going to kick your ass out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA glint of amusement flickered in his eyes. \"I think I\u0027d like that.\" He paused. Finally: \"No one you know. Her name is Maiwenn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Willow Queen.\" I took satisfaction in seeing his surprise. \"I know more about the gentry than you think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently. When she found out who you were, she wanted to watch you and find out where you stood on your fath - on the Storm King prophecy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI met his questioning look with incredulity. \"Are you seriously asking me? You think I want to see gentry take over the world?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not really. But Maiwenn wanted to be sure on your position. She opposed Storm King before and has no desire to see an invasion. She\u0027d rather put resources into the Otherworld, into staying there and making that home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smart lady,\" I said bitterly. \"I wish they\u0027d all stay there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t knock the Otherworld. It has its appeal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? So, what, you consider yourself one of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I consider myself part of both worlds. It\u0027s who I am. It\u0027s who you are too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m not part of that world.\" I stared past him without really seeing, suddenly feeling tired. \"Sometimes I don\u0027t even feel a part of this world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crossed the distance between us and sat down on the bed. Those dark eyes brimmed with concern. \"Don\u0027t say that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked away so he wouldn\u0027t see my eyes getting wet. \"I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on anymore. Everything...everything\u0027s changed. I can\u0027t turn around without someone trying to rape me. I can\u0027t trust the people I love.\" I turned back to him. \"I can\u0027t trust you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand reached out and touched my cheek. \"Yes, you can. Eugenie, I didn\u0027t sleep with you to get you pregnant. I didn\u0027t even sleep with you just because you\u0027re hot - though that was a definite perk. I liked you. I still like you. I want us to have something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d moved his hand down my neck, to my shoulder, and then to my upper arm. His fingers lazily traced the outline of Hecate\u0027s snake. Goosebumps rose on my flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t look at me like that. I don\u0027t want to get pregnant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Contraceptive technology is a wonderful thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t be involved with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words hurt coming out. \"Because...because of what you are...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hand dropped. \"I\u0027m the same - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, I know. The same as me. Kiyo, you\u0027ve got to understand.... I\u0027ve got a lot to deal with right now. I just...well, I just can\u0027t. Not yet. Maybe...\" I looked at him, at the kind and intelligent face, at the smoldering body so close to mine. \"Maybe some day, we can...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething on my face must have given away my feelings, that no matter how terrified of getting close to him I was, I still liked him and wanted him. The old mischievous smile appeared on his face, and his hand cupped my chin. He pressed his lips against my cheek. \"Then let me be your friend,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes and let his heat envelop me. \"Friends don\u0027t breathe in my ear like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be special friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kiyo - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew back a little, still smiling. \"Seriously, Eugenie. If we can\u0027t be lovers, I still want to be in your life. I want to help you through this. I want to protect you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stiffened, and my old snarkiness reared its head through the emotional miasma. \"I don\u0027t need protection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have any idea how bad it\u0027s going to get for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve handled it so far. I\u0027ll handle it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, you\u0027re amazing.\" His spoke with admiration. \"But you\u0027re also annoyingly difficult. Let someone help you. Let me help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared stonily ahead. His expression darkened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re going to come after you! Do you think I can just sit around when people are trying to hurt and rape you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heat in his voice seared me. He wasn\u0027t angry at me; he was angry for me. He regarded me in a way no one had ever looked at me before, an expression that said I meant so much to him that he would take on hell itself to protect me. That intensity wrapped around me. It thrilled me. It scared me. I didn\u0027t know what to do with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, he read my face. This time, he pulled me over, crushing my body against his. I didn\u0027t fight it. \"Let me help you,\" he repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How? You live an hour and a half away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed his face against my hair. \"I\u0027ll commute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh for God\u0027s - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean it. I know I can\u0027t be with you all the time, but I\u0027ll do what I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to trail me like a bodyguard or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do it as a fox if it makes you feel better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed in spite of myself, tightening my hold on him. I knew we shouldn\u0027t be locked in this kind of embrace, but honestly...after everything that had happened, it was comforting. And a turn-on too. But mostly comforting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that like anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s what like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Being a fox. Is it weird?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve always been that way. It\u0027s the only thing I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but...why not just stay human all the time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m stronger as a fox. Comes in handy in a fight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not too shabby as a human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Women think foxes are cute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that cute,\" I grumbled. I could sense his smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a good way to let your instincts take over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which instincts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn one movement, he had me flipped onto my back. His hands held mine down while his body pressed against the rest of me. Those lips hovered a few breaths from mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All of them,\" he growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy breath was coming out in rapid bursts, and a voice in the back of my head was yelling, Hey! Remember how you don\u0027t want to be involved with Otherworldly people? I knew that voice was right, but it was kind of hard to pay attention when my body was melting against his and one of his hands had slid down to the side of a breast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think friends are supposed to lay like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or bodyguards.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or veterinarians.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That I disagree with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crushed his mouth to mine, and it was powerful and ravenous and furious and wonderful. I couldn\u0027t think or do anything coherent in that moment, only let him keep kissing me and kissing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last he broke away. He sat up, and I could see his body tremble. The look in his eyes was still hungry and yearning, and there was a visible struggle within him, a warring of two halves. One must have won, because he took a deep breath, and that animal need faded - slightly - from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to go,\" he said at last. \"I\u0027ve got to work in two hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stared at each other for a long time. I pulled a sheet up, letting it cover part of me. A grin lit his features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. That helps.\" He stood up and moved toward the door. \"Hey, would you mind meeting Maiwenn? She wants to talk to you in person, see what you\u0027re like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You seem pretty chummy with her,\" I said. The words came out sharper than I\u0027d intended, but he looked unfazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a good friend. And I believe in her philosophies. She wants both our worlds left intact. So do I. She can be a good friend to you too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she strong enough to come over here?\" He nodded. \"If she\u0027ll do it, I\u0027ll meet her. I\u0027m not really keen on going over there anytime soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a few steps out the door, and this time I called to him. \"Hey...Kiyo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All these people and...things are coming after me because they think I\u0027m going to be Damien\u0027s mother or something...but seriously, do you actually think any of it\u0027s true? Do you really believe this prophecy could happen? Roland - my stepdad - says prophecies are a dime a dozen in the Otherworld.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are,\" Kiyo said slowly, a slight wrinkle between his eyes as he thought. \"And most don\u0027t come true. But a lot do, a lot more than you\u0027d think growing up here. The thing about prophecies is...well, people sometimes read the wrong things into them. Or, in trying to avert them, they only make the prophecy come true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shivered, half-wishing he would have just said prophecies were a bunch of crap. \"You mean like Oedipus? How his father got rid of him to beat that prophecy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly. Doing that only ended up making it happen.\" Seeing my dark look, he smiled. \"Hey, don\u0027t worry about it. I told you most don\u0027t come true. And besides, you\u0027re not trying to have kids, so there\u0027s nothing to worry about. Concentrate on the now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him a faltering smile back, hoping he was right. \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held my eyes for a few seconds before stepping out of the room, only to return a moment later with my burnt mirror. He set it on the dresser, regarding it with displeasure. \"Sorry I wasn\u0027t here sooner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I said, mustering some bravado, \"I told you I can take care of myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose dark eyes flashed. \"I know. You\u0027re a dangerous woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t entirely sure if he referred to my fighting abilities or something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he was gone, I lay back in bed with a sigh, thinking I might not move for a week. Things just got weirder and weirder around here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly I felt a faint pressure build in the room. I sat up straight. Red eyes peered at me from a dim corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Volusian? I didn\u0027t summon you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gave us permission to come if we acquired information.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I suppose I did. I didn\u0027t really think any of you would actually listen to me. What\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve come to tell you Otherworldly interest in you has increased.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him stupidly a moment, then pointed to the bloody athame I\u0027d used on the Gray Man. \"Gee, you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"More than these scattered attacks. Before, others were interested in you simply because of your heritage. Now, after seeing you...some are more excited still. They find you...attractive.\" I could tell the concept baffled him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great. Now I\u0027m fertile and hot. So what\u0027s this mean? Should I be expecting daily attacks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More like...organized attacks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Groups?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Worse than a group of guys trying to have sex with me? How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For now, only creatures and gentry who can cross over in physical or elemental form will try. But we are weeks from Beltane, mistress. When the doors open...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus,\" I breathed. \"Everything with a dick is going to come looking for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t bother with a response. But when I said nothing more, he asked, \"What will you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think? The same as I\u0027ve been doing. I\u0027ll fight them off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stayed quiet, but I could feel his disapproval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else do you expect me to do? Submit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I expect you to not sit around and wait for the inevitable. You might as well be from one of the bride-by-capture societies. Always being on the defensive will get you nowhere; eventually someone will overpower you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed without really finding anything funny. \"So, what, I go on the offensive? Head over and just start taking on random gentry and spirits?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You start claiming your heritage. They attack you because you let them, because you kick at one and then wait for the next. You make yourself a victim, yet you are Storm King\u0027s daughter. In his day, his rule stretched farther than any of the current monarchs\u0027. His kingdom may be gone now, but his legacy makes you royalty. If you acted like it, they wouldn\u0027t attack you so brazenly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt they\u0027d give up wanting to father Storm King\u0027s heir just because I started calling myself a queen or a princess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, they\u0027d still want you, but they would go about it differently. They\u0027d approach you with respect. They would try to woo you. Now they only treat you with disdain. They treat you like the victim - the piece of flesh - that you have let yourself become.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t really like the thought of a bunch of gentry bringing me flowers and chocolate, but I liked it better than rape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but joking aside, I can\u0027t just go in there and say, \u0027Hey, I\u0027m Storm King\u0027s daughter, treat me with respect.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" he said dryly, \"it would be a start. However, you will drive home your connection to him most when you stop relying on those.\" He pointed at my weapons. \"They make you human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are half-human. If you want them to respect you as one of the gentry, you need to remind them of who you are. You need to draw on the power within you, on your father\u0027s legacy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about what Roland had said, about how he had purposely buried my power. Faint flickers of the vision came back to me, how I\u0027d reached for power just before it ended. \"No. I won\u0027t use gentry magic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVolusian sighed. He pointed to the burnt mirror. \"Mistress, why did you use that as a weapon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because a Gray Man caught me unarmed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Had you been in full control of your magic, you would have needed no weapons. You could have destroyed him as soon as he crossed your threshold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tugged the sheet up and wrapped my arms around myself. The thought of power like that terrified me...and yet deep down, I saw its appeal. I didn\u0027t like being defenseless at twenty-six any more than I had at twelve. Volusian sensed this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your true nature knows I am right. It longs to be realized.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I give in to this nature, I\u0027ll become gentry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll never be fully gentry or human. That you must accept. You must simply take the best of each.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if I wanted to do this\" - I swallowed, still uncertain if I wanted the kind of power he was talking about - \"I wouldn\u0027t know the first thing about tapping it. Roland can\u0027t teach me about gentry magic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you\u0027ll have to find a gentry teacher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where will I find one who won\u0027t try to rape me first? I don\u0027t really have any friends over there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you?\" He looked at me expectantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean Dorian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of all the rulers in the Otherworld right now, only he has ordered his people to leave you alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seriously? But why? He told me himself he wants to see Storm King\u0027s invasion happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most believe he gave the order simply because he wants you for himself. I, however, suspect he also probably acts out of some ridiculous sense of altruism - and his own pride. Of course, some of his people won\u0027t heed the warning, but you will find less of them attacking you than others. Like Aeson and his followers, for example.\" Apparently Aeson was alive after all. I\u0027d forgotten to ask Kiyo about that in the wake of all the other drama.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still...Dorian made the attempt, huh?\" I thought back to my encounter with him. Of all the gentry, he had been the one I almost felt comfortable with, which was startling, considering how odd he was. And he had helped me. \"But I know he wants to have sex with me too. He didn\u0027t really make that a secret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course he does. Which is why he\u0027ll help you. He\u0027ll help you because he thinks it\u0027ll bring you to his bed. And because being close to you will impress his rivals and allies alike. They\u0027ll think you\u0027re lovers, even if you aren\u0027t. He\u0027ll like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ll return to me. You won\u0027t be able to help yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shivered, and Volusian continued: \"You\u0027ll benefit as well. Go to him as an equal, and he will treat you as one. His attitude will go a long way to influence others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I do this, I\u0027ll have come a long way from being feared by the gentry to cozying up with one for political reasons. That\u0027s quite a leap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really. Not if you consider how far you\u0027ve come since your trip to Aeson\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s an understatement.\" I rubbed my eyes. \"I don\u0027t know, Volusian. I still don\u0027t know if I\u0027m ready to approach Dorian. I need to think about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As my mistress wishes. But I would advise you to think fast. Decide before Beltane. Siding with Dorian will offer both magical and political benefits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Noted. Thanks for the update. And the advice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bowed, and I stood up to send him back. Before I did, I couldn\u0027t help messing with him. I was still naked, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Volusian, you haven\u0027t been checking me out, have you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me his trademark bland stare. \"I assure you, mistress, the only allure your bare flesh has for me is to remind me how easy it will be to slice open.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. If not for the fact he was actually serious, he\u0027d be so much fun. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/storm-born-dark-swan-1/page-13.html","bookId":2038,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:34:10 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:34:10 PM"}
