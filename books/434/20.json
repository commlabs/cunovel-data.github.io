A LOST CLUE.","content":"\u0026nbsp;What would you advise me to do, Mr. Sturgis?” asked Bernard as he was dressing the next morning. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I advise you to leave Professor Puffer. He seems to be a thoroughly bad man. You will be in danger as long as you remain with him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I will take your advice, though this will throw me upon my own resources. I think I can make a living in some way, though I should know better how to go about it in America.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How much money have you got?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “About twenty dollars.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That won’t last you long. I must see what I can think of for you. First of all, you mustn’t stay in Liverpool. Professor Puffer would probably make an effort to get you into his clutches.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Where would you advise me to go?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “To London. I shall leave directly after breakfast and you can go up with me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I shall be glad to go with one who has been there before. But I must keep out of the way of the professor.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I will arrange matters for you. When you are dressed, go at once to the station of the London and Northwestern Railway. You will find a restaurant close by where you can get breakfast. Then go to the waiting room, where I will join you before the next train starts.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Bernard followed the directions of his friend, and Mr. Sturgis went down to breakfast. Professor Puffer was already in the coffee room.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Where is my ward?” he asked abruptly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I can’t tell you, sir,” returned Nelson Sturgis coolly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Didn’t he pass the night with you?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then you should know where he is.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I have already told you that I don’t know.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do you think he has left the hotel?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I think it quite probable.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Did he tell you where he was going?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I believe you are deceiving me,” said Professor Puffer angrily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And I am sure that you are impertinent. I may feel inclined to pull your nose.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nelson Sturgis was a tall, athletic man, and Professor Puffer was persuaded that he could carry out his threat if he was so minded. Accordingly he thought it best to desist.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n After breakfast Mr. Sturgis summoned a hotel attendant.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Here is half a crown,” he said. “Go to the chamber of my young friend, Bernard Brooks, and bring his satchel to my room.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “All right, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This was done without the observation of Puffer, or he would have prevented the removal of Bernard’s luggage.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Sturgis called a hackney coach, had his luggage put on, including Bernard’s satchel, and drove to the railway station.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, Bernard, I have brought your satchel,” he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you, sir. I was wondering what I should do without it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I had no idea of leaving it with the professor. Now I will secure tickets to London.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What will be the price?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Never mind. I will undertake to get you to London free of expense to yourself. Afterwards we will consult about your plans.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Just as the train was starting, Professor Puffer reached the station, and from the platform espied his ward in the act of leaving him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Stop!” he called out, shaking his fist at the receding train.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Good-by, Professor Puffer!” said Bernard with a smile and a wave of the hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Puffer in his anger, ran a few steps, talking violently.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “My ward is running away,” he said to a policeman. “Can’t you stop the train?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No; I can’t.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But I want to get him back.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then you’ll have to go before a magistrate.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Where is that train going?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “To London.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then I’ll go, too. When is the next train?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “At twelve o’clock, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Professor Puffer returned to the hotel at once, packed his trunk, and enrolled himself as a passenger on the noon train.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If that fellow escapes me,” he said with an ugly look, “he’ll have to be pretty smart. I won’t have it said that a boy of his age has got the better of me.” Mr. Sturgis bought first class tickets, and Bernard found himself in a handsomely upholstered compartment only large enough to hold eight passengers.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The doors were locked after they started, which struck Bernard as peculiar.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I like our American cars better,” he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “So do I, but they are not so exclusive. The English like to be exclusive.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was an express train, and deposited them in London in a few hours.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now, Bernard,” said Mr. Sturgis, “I think it will be well for us to go to different hotels. I shall go to the Charing Cross, but this is a prominent hotel, and should you go there you could easily be traced.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Where shall I go?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “There is a comfortable family hotel in Arundel Street, Strand. The charges, including room and board, are only about six shillings per day, or a dollar and a half in American money. At the Charing Cross they are higher.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then I will go to Arundel Street.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very well. When you reach London I will see you started for your hotel.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Shan’t I see you again, sir?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, I will call around in the evening. By the way, I have thought of a way to put Professor Puffer off the track.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How is that, sir?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He will very likely question some of the hackmen. I will therefore take you with me to the Charing Cross. Then we will dismiss the hackman, and you can take a cab from there to Arundel Street.” This precaution was well taken. When Professor Puffer reached London he began to interview the hackmen.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I had two friends arrive by the nine o’clock train,” he said, “a gentleman and a boy of sixteen.” Then he described them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “They neglected to tell me at what hotel they intended to stop. Do any of you remember seeing them?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, sir,” replied one cabby. “I took them to the Charing Cross.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you,” said Puffer, in a tone of satisfaction. “That is just what I wanted to find out. Here’s a shilling.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you, sir. You are a gentleman.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And you may take me to the Charing Cross. I shall probably find them there.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I should make a good detective,” thought the professor complacently, as he rolled through the streets. “Master Bernard Brooks will find that he hasn’t made much in his attempt to outwit me. Indeed I am better off for it, as he has been obliged to pay his own fare to London.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When he reached the hotel, he inquired at the office: “Is there an American gentleman named Sturgis here?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Where is he now?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “In the dining-room, taking dinner.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Professor Puffer smiled maliciously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Doubtless Bernard will be with him,” He reflected. “They will be rather surprised to see me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He walked into the dining-room and looked around.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n His search was partially rewarded.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At a table near the window sat Nelson Sturgis with a substantial dinner before him, but Bernard was not with him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He is somewhere in the hotel,” thought the professor. “Meanwhile I will pay my respects to Mr. Sturgis.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I hope I see you well, Mr. Sturgis,” said the professor, with an ironical smile.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you, I am quite well,” answered Sturgis composedly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You see I have reached London not far behind you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “So I see.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Did you and my ward have a pleasant journey?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very pleasant.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am indebted to you for paying his traveling expenses.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You can reimburse me if you like.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You must excuse me. I only pay the boy’s bills when he is traveling with me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Just as you like.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I will now relieve you of the charge which, without my permission, you have undertaken. Will you be kind enough to notify Bernard that I have come for him?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why do you give me that commission?” asked Sturgis, arching his brows. “Are you under the impression that Bernard is with me?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Certainly. Isn’t he?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Isn’t he stopping at this hotel?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He is not.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Where, then, is he? I have positive information that he came here with you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “From whom did you obtain the information?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “From the hackman who drove you here,” answered Professor Puffer triumphantly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then I can’t deny it,” said Sturgis, with affected chagrin.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Of course you can’t. It wasn’t much trouble to get on your track. I am sharper than you probably anticipated.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very true, Professor Puffer.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now I will thank you to tell me where Bernard is. Of course you know?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I can guess.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “So I supposed.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But I don’t propose to tell.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That is of very little importance. He is in this hotel. I have traced him here.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He is not here now, however. He is in a different part of London.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is this true?” asked Professor Puffer, his jaw dropping.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Quite true, I assure you. By the way, Professor Puffer, you may be sharp, but I think I am a match for you. And now, if you kindly leave me, I will resume my dinner.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2955/81270.html","bookId":434,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:41:49 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:41:49 AM"}
