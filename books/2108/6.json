{"id":91555,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\u003cp\u003eFirst Contact\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly sat in the dim light of the dying campfire, a line of tiny vials on the ground before him, paralleling a line of empty crossbow darts. One by one, he took the vials and very carefully dripped in a few drops from the flask that Kierkan Rufo had delivered to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is he doing?\" Elbereth asked Rufo as they stood on the edge of the firelight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Making darts for his crossbow,\" the tall man explained. His face seeming even more angular, almost inhuman, in the flickering shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbereth studied the diminutive weapon, resting on the ground at Cadderly\u0027s side. The elf\u0027s expression was not complimentary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is a drow device,\" he spat, loudly enough for Cadderly to hear. Cadderly looked up and knew that the elf prince was about to put him on trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you consort with dark elves?\" Elbereth asked bluntly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have never met one,\" Cadderly answered simply, thinking, but not adding, that if Elbereth\u0027s arrogance exemplified the good side of the elven nation, he most certainly would have no desire to meet one of the bad side!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you acquire the crossbow then?\" Elbereth pressed, as though he was just looking for a reason to begin an argument with Cadderly. \"And why would you wish to carry the weapon of such an evil race?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly picked up the crossbow, somehow comforted in the fact that it had brought Elbereth some grief. He understood that Elbereth provoked him now simply out of general frustration, and he certainly sympathized with the elf\u0027s worries for Shilmista. Still, Cadderly had his own concerns and was in no mood for Elbereth\u0027s continued insults. \"Dwarf-made, actually,\" he corrected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nearly as bad,\" the elf snipped without hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly\u0027s gray eyes were not as striking as Elbereth\u0027s silvery orbs, but his glare more than equaled the elf\u0027s in intensity. In a fight of weapons, of course, Elbereth could easily cut him down, but if the elf prince launched more insults Ivan and Pikel\u0027s way, Cadderly had every intention of pummeling him with fists. Cadderly was a fine wrestler, having grown up among the clerics of Oghma, whose principal rituals involved weaponless combat. While Elbereth was nearly as tall as the six-foot-high scholar, Cadderly figured that he outweighed the slender elf by at least seventy pounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently understanding that he had pushed the young scholar as far as he could without starting a fight, Elbereth did not immediately continue, but neither did he blink his silver eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The perimeter is clear,\" said Danica as she came back into camp. She looked from Elbereth to Cadderly and saw the obvious tension. \"What has happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbereth turned to her and smiled warmly, which bothered Cadderly more than the uncompromising glare the elf had given him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A discussion of the crossbow, nothing more,\" Elbereth assured Danica. \"I do not understand the value of such a puny weapon nor the honor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica put a sympathetic look Cadderly\u0027s way. If the young scholar was vulnerable about anything in the world, it was the crossbow and the memories it inevitably conjured. Unexpectedly, Cadderly launched himself in the face of those memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I killed a man with this,\" he growled dangerously. Danica\u0027s look turned to one of horror, and Cadderly realized how stupid that proclamation had been. What a ridiculous and disgusting thing to brag about! He knew he had laid himself open to the elf now, that Elbereth could easily destroy him in this argument, for Cadderly would find no courage to back up his bravado.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the elf, looking from Cadderly to Danica, chose to discontinue the discussion. \"It is my watch,\" he said simply and disappeared into the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly looked to Danica and shrugged apologetically. The young woman just sat across the fire from him, wrapped herself in a heavy blanket, and lay down to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly considered the crossbow, feeling that it had betrayed him once again. He wished he had been more attentive in his combat studies at the library; then, perhaps, he would not need to carry the unconventional weapon. But while the other clerics had practiced with the mace, quarterstaff, or club, Cadderly had concentrated on his spindle-disks twin disks joined by a connecting bar, on which was tied a slender cord a useful enough weapon for felling small game and an enjoyable toy to put through a variety of mesmerizing tricks, but hardly a match for a sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly\u0027s hand went unconsciously to the disks, which were looped on his belt. He had used them in battle a couple of times, had dropped Kierkan Rufo when the angular man, under the chaos curse\u0027s influence, had come after Cadderly with a knife. Even against the tiny blade that Rufo had carried, Cadderly had won only because his opponent had become distracted. A single lucky throw had saved him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly considered his walking stick as well, with its sculpted ram\u0027s-head handle and smooth-bored interior. It was an expensive item and well balanced, and Cadderly had used it, too, in battle. Danica had told him that such a small staff she called it a bo stick was a favorite among monks in her mother\u0027s ancient homeland of Tabot. Cadderly was barely skilled with it. He could twirl it and thrust it, even parry basic attacks, but he wouldn\u0027t want to test his talents against a seasoned fighter like Elbereth, or any monster, for that matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResigned, the young scholar filled another vial and carefully snapped it into place in the hollow of a dart. He slipped the loaded dart into a loop on his bandolier; that made twelve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the first few fights at least, Cadderly might show as well as Elbereth. The young scholar hated that that fact mattered to him, but he couldn\u0027t deny that it did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eastern fringes of Shilmista were not too far from the Edificant Library, and, even crossing the rough mountain trails, the travelers could have seen the forest on their second day out. Shilmista was a long wood, though, running one hundred and fifty miles from north to south, and Elbereth wanted to come out of the mountains nearer the forest\u0027s center, where the elves made their primary homes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor several more days, the four companions walked up, down, and around high peaks and through steep valleys. It was summer, even in the mountains, and the air was warm and the sky blue. Each turn in the trail promised a new majestic view, but even mountain scenery became somewhat dull to Cadderly after several straight days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOften during this quiet time, Cadderly took the Tome of Universal Harmony from his horse\u0027s pack. He did not begin reading it, though, for he was too agitated by the potential trials ahead and Elbereth\u0027s growing relationship with Danica the two got on famously, swapping tales of places Cadderly had never seen to concentrate enough for a proper read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the fifth day, they came at last to the western ridges. Looking down, they could see the dark canopy of Shilmista, a peaceful and quiet cover for the mounting tumult beneath the thick boughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is my home,\" Elbereth announced to Danica. \"There is no place in all the world to match Shilmista\u0027s beauty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly wanted to rebuff him. The young scholar had read of many wondrous lands, magical lands, and by all accounts, Shilmista, though a fitting wood for elven folk, was nothing extraordinary. Cadderly had the foresight, though, to understand how pitiful he would sound in making such a claim, and the common sense to anticipate Elbereth\u0027s angry reaction. He wisely kept his thoughts to himself and resolved to point out Shilmista\u0027s weak points to Danica later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the path had become clear and smooth enough for riding, the steep decline and winding turns forced the party to continue walking the horses. As they came to the lower foothills, mountain stone gave way to earthen ground, and here walking their mounts proved a fortunate thing, for on the back of Temmerisa, his great stallion, Elbereth would not have noticed the tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stooped low to examine them and said nothing for a long while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly and the others could guess from the elf\u0027s grim expression the source of those markings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goblins?\" Danica asked finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some, perhaps,\" Elbereth replied, his gaze drifting back toward his precious forest, \"but most are too big to have been made by goblins.\" The elf took out his longbow and handed the reigns of his horse to Kierkan Rufo. He then motioned for Danica to give her mount over to Cadderly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young scholar wasn\u0027t thrilled with acting the part of a page, but he couldn\u0027t argue against the value of having Danica and Elbereth with their hands free, ready to meet any sudden attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbereth took up the lead, pausing often to study new tracks, and Danica fell into line at the rear of the party, watching all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey came back into the tree line and grew even more cautious, for shadows loomed all about them, possible hiding spots for monsters setting an ambush. For an hour they crossed in and out of the gloom, moving under thick trees one moment and coming suddenly into the open sunlight the next as the trail wound across wide stones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTemmerisa\u0027s thousand bells tinkled suddenly with the steed\u0027s nervous movement. Elbereth immediately went on his guard, crouching low and looking all about. He moved across the trail, slipped into concealment amid a tumble of boulders, and peered down at the mountainsides below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica and Cadderly joined him immediately, but Rufo stayed back with the horses, seeming ready to spring upon his roan mount in an instant and fly away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The trail doubles back on itself down below,\" the elf explained in a whisper. His observations were evident to Cadderly and Danica, for the trees and brush were not thick below them and the looping road was clearly visible. Elbereth seemed intent on one huge maple tree, its thick branches overhanging the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There!\" Danica whispered, pointing to the very same tree. \"On the lowest branch above the road.\" Elbereth nodded gravely, and Danica blew a quiet whistle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly watched them in confusion. He, too, peered intently at the tree, but all he saw were thick, overlapping leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The limb bends under their weight,\" Elbereth remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whose weight?\" Cadderly had to ask. Elbereth scowled, but Danica took pity on Cadderly and continued to point out what she had noticed until he, at last, nodded in recognition. Several dark forms were crouched together on that low branch, high above the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Orcs?\" Danica asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too big for orcs,\" reasoned Elbereth. \"Orogs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica\u0027s delicate features crinkled with confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Orogs are kin to orcs,\" cut in Cadderly, beating the elf to the explanation. Orogs were not a common monster, but one that Cadderly had read about in many books. \"Larger and stronger than their pig-faced cousins. It is believed that they originated - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think they are waiting for?\" Danica interrupted before Cadderly could make a complete fool of himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Us,\" Elbereth said grimly. \"They have heard our horses, perhaps seen us on the open expanses of the higher trails.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there another way around?\" Cadderly knew the question sounded ridiculous even as he asked it. Danica, and especially Elbereth, had no intention of going around the monsters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbereth considered the terrain straight from his position. \"If I pick my way down the mountainside while you continue along the trail,\" he reasoned, \"I may be able to take a few of them down with my bow.\" The elf prince nodded in affirmation of his own plan. \"Come, then,\" he said, \"we must get the horses moving again before the orogs grow suspicious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica turned and started back to Rufo, but Cadderly was struck with an idea. \"Let me go,\" he offered, a smile widening across his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbereth regarded him curiously, and even more so when Cadderly took out his tiny crossbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You believe you can inflict more damage with that than I with my longbow?\" the elf prince asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t you prefer to fight them on the ground?\" Cadderly replied, grinning Danica\u0027s way. Elbereth, too, looked to the woman, and she nodded and smiled, trusting in Cadderly and knowing that playing a role in the fight was important to the young scholar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go along the trail,\" Cadderly told them. \"I shall meet you at the tree.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbereth, still not convinced, turned back to study the young scholar. \"Your hat and cape,\" the elf said, holding out his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly\u0027s pause displayed his confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blue is not a forest color,\" Elbereth explained. \"It shows as clearly as a fire in the dark of night. We will be fortunate if the orogs have not already spotted you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They have not,\" Danica insisted, realizing that Elbereth had made that last statement only to belittle Cadderly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scholar untied his short cape and handed it and the hat to Elbereth. \"I will see you at the tree,\" he said finally, trying to appear confident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis firm jaw weakened as soon as the others moved out of sight. What had he gotten himself into? Even if he managed to get down the steep slope without breaking his neck and causing enough noise for all the orogs in the Snowflake Mountains to hear, what would he do if they noticed him? What defense could Cadderly present against even a single opponent?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook the dark thoughts away and started down, having no other choice, he believed, if he wished to hold any honor at all in Danica\u0027s almond eyes. He stumbled and tripped, stubbed his toes a dozen times, and set several stones skipping down, but somehow managed to get level with the giant maple apparently without disturbing the ambush-intent monsters. He crawled into a crevice between two sharp-edged rocks a short distance from the side of the trail. He could see the orogs clearly then; nearly a dozen crouched side by side on the low branch. They held nets and spears and crude swords, and it wasn\u0027t difficult for Cadderly to discern their tactics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monsters went quiet. At first, Cadderly feared he had been discovered, but he soon realized that the orogs continued looking up the trail. He knew that his friends would arrive soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe loaded the crossbow, taking care to move the small crank slowly and smoothly so that it wouldn\u0027t make any noise. Then he leveled the weapon but where to shoot? He could probably knock an orog out of the tree, maybe even kill one if his aim or his luck was good enough. His earlier boasts seemed so foolish now, with the danger so very close and the responsibility fully on his shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to go with his original plan; Elbereth and Danica were counting on him to get the monsters out of the tree. He took aim, not at any of the monsters, but at where the thick branch joined the trunk. It was not a difficult shot with the accurate crossbow, but would the explosive suffice? Cadderly took out a second dart, just in case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orogs shifted nervously; Cadderly could hear the plodding hoofbeats down the trail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deneir be with me,\" the young scholar mumbled, and he squeezed the crossbow\u0027s trigger. The dart floated in, struck the branch, and collapsed on the vial, and the ensuing explosion shook the tree violently. Orogs grabbed on one tumbled from the branch and Cadderly, to his relief, heard a loud cracking noise. The young scholar sent another dart looping in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe branch blew apart. An orog screamed as its ankle got hooked on the jagged break, the skin tearing off the side of its leg as it fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica and Elbereth, upon their horses, were barely thirty feet from the tree when the orogs tumbled out. Elbereth, concerned, glanced sidelong at the young woman, for only one of the monsters seemed injured and the others were well armed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are only ten of them!\" Danica cried, reaching down to pull a crystalline-bladed dagger from a boot sheath. She laughed wildly and spurred her horse ahead. Temmerisa, bearing the elf, charged right behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica came in hard and fast on the closest three monsters. Just before she reached them, she rolled off the side of her horse, caught a handhold on the saddle\u0027s cinch, and pulled herself under the horse, straight through the beast\u0027s legs. The horse blasted through the stunned orogs, all of them expecting Danica on the wrong side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica hit the ground running, used her momentum to leap into a spin, and connected on the closest orog with a circle kick that snapped the creature\u0027s neck and sent it tumbling away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer wrist flicked as soon as she got her bearings, launching the dagger, point over hilt. It spun several times, a glittering sliver in the sunlight, before burying itself hilt-deep in the second orog\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third monster heaved its spear and drew out a crude sword. Its aim had been perfect, but Danica was too quick to be taken by such a clumsy weapon. She sidestepped and threw out a forearm parry that sent the spear flying harmlessly wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orog came in unconcerned, and Danica nearly laughed at how defenseless she must have appeared to the six-and-a-half-foot, two-hundred-pound monster. Slender and pretty, she barely topped five feet, with unkempt locks flying wildly about her shoulders and eyes that sparkled, to the unknowing observer, with childish innocence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood quickly replaced drool on the orog\u0027s hungry lips. It stepped in and reached for Danica with its free hand. She caught it with a lightning-quick jab that took out two of its front teeth. Danica jumped back, bouncing on the balls of her feet and feeling good about the beginning of this battle. It had taken just a few seconds, but two monsters lay dead or dying and the third stood teetering and trying to shake the stars out of its vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbereth\u0027s charge was even more straightforward and more brutal. He led with a single bow shot, catching a monster in the shoulder. Then, drawing his sword and slipping his arm through the leather straps of his shield, the elf trusted in his disciplined steed and crashed right into the main group of orogs. His magical blade glowed a bluish flame as he hacked at the monstrous throng. He took several quick hits from the monsters\u0027 crude weapons, but his fine shield and finer armor deflected the blows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore deadly were Elbereth\u0027s thrusts; the unarmored orogs simply couldn\u0027t afford to swap blows with the elf, as the closest monster, the one with the arrow in its shoulder, learned when Elbereth responded to its spear thrust by lopping off its head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTemmerisa reared and danced about, keeping in perfect balance and harmony with its familiar rider. One orog slipped behind the shining white horse, its spear held high for a throw that would have taken Elbereth squarely in the back. Temmerisa kicked with both hind feet, connecting on the orog\u0027s chest and launching it many yards away. The broken monster crumpled to the ground, gasping futilely with lungs that had collapsed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbereth\u0027s battle would have been a rout then, for only two monsters remained (and one of these could barely stand, leaning against the huge tree with one of its legs torn apart). But when the limb had broken, a single orog had managed to keep a handhold in the tree. Grasping a net in its free hand, the monster swung out on the higher branch and timed its leap perfectly, coming down on the slender elf\u0027s back and bearing Elbereth to the ground under it and under the net.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA deceptively swift sword cut forced Danica to hop and throw her head backward. She knew that a monster as powerful as an orog could not be taken lightly, but she found herself distracted, for off to the side, Elbereth had gone down, and Kierkan Rufo had not yet entered the fray. Just as unnerving to the young woman, two of the orogs had fled toward Cadderly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother slice made Danica drop almost to the ground; a third sent her rolling to the side. The orog, confident again, advanced steadily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt swung again, but this time Danica, instead of backing away, charged straight ahead. She caught the orog\u0027s sword hand in her own and stepped toward it, hooking her free forearm so forcefully around the orog\u0027s extended arm that she heard the monster\u0027s elbow snap. Fierce Danica barely gave the monster time to cry in pain. Still holding fast to its sword hand, she whipped her other arm back, free of the monster\u0027s, and threw her elbow up and out, slamming the creature in the nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica\u0027s elbow came back tight to her side and her backhand went snapping out, scoring another solid hit. When the arm recoiled, still before the orog had time to react, Danica straightened her hand tightly and chopped across the orog\u0027s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dipped under the monster\u0027s trapped arm. Her grip turned the muscled limb half a circuit as she passed under it, and Danica turned about to face the creature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orog reached for her weakly, but Danica paid the lame attempt no heed. Her foot shot up under the orog\u0027s reach and slammed the monster in the chin, then again, and a third time, in rapid succession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cadderly,\" the monk breathed, looking down the trail, for the two fleeing monsters were close to her beloved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly, acting on pure instinct, didn\u0027t hesitate to consider the moral consequences in the least as the first orog bore down on him, pointedly shifting its course when it noticed him lying between the stones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn exploding dart abruptly halted its charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monster\u0027s surprised roar came out as a wheeze, for the dart had put a hole cleanly through one lung. Stubbornly the monster came on, and Cadderly shot it again, this time in the belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orog doubled over, growling in agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Die, damn you,\" Cadderly moaned when it straightened and came on again. This time his shot blew off the top of the orog\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly himself was having trouble finding his breath, and his revulsion turned to stark horror when he looked up to see the second orog towering over him, straddling the stones with its very big sword angled to split Cadderly in half. There was no time for another dart, the young scholar knew, so he grabbed his walking stick and tossed it up toward the monster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orog\u0027s face contorted in confusion as it batted the walking stick aside, but Cadderly\u0027s ruse was not without purpose. In the split second the orog\u0027s attention was stolen, Cadderly turned himself about and rolled to his back, looking up to the orog\u0027s backside. He curled up in a ball, hooking his calves behind the orog\u0027s knees and then straightened and pulled with all his might.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a long moment, nothing happened, and Cadderly thought that he must look ridiculous indeed, as though he were straining against an immovable object. Then the orog did fall forward, but not heavily, and with no damage done. Cadderly scrambled forward, over the orog\u0027s back, and he hooked one arm about the orog\u0027s thick neck and pulled for all his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUndaunted, the creature stood back up, taking Cadderly with it. It casually looked around for its sword, dropped in the fall, then spotted the weapon and made for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadderly realized that the monster could easily jab the weapon behind it, right into his vulnerable torso. Frantic now, the young scholar considered letting go and making a run for cover. He knew that he would never get out of the monster\u0027s reach in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fall, damn you!\" Cadderly growled, tightening and twisting his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orog, to Cadderly\u0027s astonishment, dropped its sword back to the ground. As though it had noticed the choke hold for the first time, the monster\u0027s thick hands came up to grab at Cadderly\u0027s arm, but by that time, there remained little strength in them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes closed, Cadderly desperately held on, still pulling with all his might.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the orog tumbled facedown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last orog, near the tree, could not put its right foot on the ground. It wanted to go with its two companions, one lying atop the netted elf and the other waving a sword menacingly and looking for an opening, but the creature winced whenever its toe came near the ground. The beast looked up and saw the flesh from its leg hanging grotesquely from the jag on the broken tree branch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCursing its luck and ignoring the burning agony, the stubborn creature hopped on its good foot out from the maple\u0027s wide trunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight in Kierkan Rufo\u0027s path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRufo rode one horse and held the other beside it, and his charge came powerfully, if a bit late. The angular man hadn\u0027t meant to run the orog down with his own horse he had purposely placed the riderless steed closer to the tree but the orog\u0027s unexpected movement had put it right between both horses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monster got tangled in the worst possible way and was stepped on several times, but when the horses passed, it was still alive, lying helplessly on its back. Its spine was crushed, leaving it staring straight up at the dripping meat of its own ripped leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe riderless horse crossed the broken branch without trouble, but Rufo\u0027s horse, stumbling from the tangled orog, flipped headlong, sending the angular man on a long, bouncing roll. Rufo spat dirt, shifted about, and sat looking back on the battle. His attack did much to aid Elbereth\u0027s cause, for one of the three orogs moving to engage the elf was down and a second had broken away from the fray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was little comfort to poor Rufo, though, for the orog had only run because it had spotted an easier target Rufo. It charged down the trail, its huge sword waving and its tongue hanging hungrily between broken yellow teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRufo saw Danica, over to the side, react. She snapped off one more kick, which sent her orog\u0027s head jerking backward, then broke free of the monster. She hesitated, glanced at Elbereth, but apparently figured that the elf had the situation under control, and ran after the orog approaching Rufo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbereth squirmed around to face the heavy orog. He worked his hand to his belt, using his other arm to keep the ugly monster\u0027s snapping mouth from biting at his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElbereth\u0027s arm moved in three rapid jolts, the orog heaving with each. The fourth time, Elbereth held his arm tight against the monster and began twisting his wrist back and forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monster rolled off the elf\u0027s slender stiletto and thrashed in the road, trying to hold its entrails inside its opened belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a single movement, the agile Elbereth slipped out from under the crude net and came up to his knees. Merciless and grim-faced, he whipped his dagger into the squirming orog\u0027s leg so that it couldn\u0027t run while he retrieved his sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanica was swift, as fast as anyone Rufo had ever seen, but the orog\u0027s lead was too great. Reluctantly, the angular man pulled his mace from his belt and tried to stand. He was less skilled with weapons than even Cadderly and could not hope to hold out for long. Even worse, Rufo\u0027s ankle, twisted in the fall, would not support him, and he fell back to the seat of his pants. The orog was almost upon him; he knew he was about to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orog\u0027s head jerked suddenly to the side, then half of its face blew off, showering Rufo and Danica, as she rushed in, with blood and gore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRufo and Danica stared at each other in disbelief for a moment, then turned in unison to the side, to see Cadderly standing between the rocks, crossbow in hand and a horrified expression splayed across his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-cleric-quintet-in-sylvan-shadows-the-cleric-quintet-2/page-6.html","bookId":2108,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:51:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:51:36 PM"}
