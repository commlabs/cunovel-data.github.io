{"id":46502,"no":1185,"title":"Chapter 1183: I Passed?","content":"\u003cp\u003e“What do I do, what do I do!?” Days passed, and Bai Xiaochun was still sitting in the main square on the damaged fan, looking anxiously at the spot to enter the hundredth level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespair ate at his heart, despair at the fact that he had no chance at passing the hundredth level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is ridiculous! How are you supposed to pass the hundredth level when it\u0027s so hard!? You definitely have to be an archaean…. But then again, even an archaean would probably be killed…. And yet, here I am….” He tugged at his hair, his eyes bloodshot and growing increasingly crimson. Eventually, he slapped his bag of holding to summon a few jugs of alcohol, and began to drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drank for three days straight….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hemmed and hawed, occasionally pacing back and forth, occasionally sitting there dejectedly. At a certain point, the spirit automaton showed up, sat down in front of him, and joined him in sighing. Whenever he stood up as if to make another attempt at a challenge, the spirit automaton would say something along the lines of, “Even I’m not sure why the exalted sovereign did things this way. I\u0027ve been wanting a new master for a long time, you know. You have no idea what it\u0027s been like to see so many people die in such horrific and painful fashion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes he would tell stories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I remember one time when someone came along with an incredible fleshly body, and terrifying powers of regeneration. I definitely thought that he would become my new master. But guess what happened? \u003cem\u003eBam!\u003c/em\u003e The sovereign smashed him into a bloody pulp. Oh, the humanity!”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more Bai Xiaochun heard such stories, the jumpier he got.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was truly horrific. Blood was splashing everywhere, and then there was this sort of popping sound as his head exploded….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spirit automaton’s sighs echoed about constantly as he gave very serious advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know, Bai Xiaochun, I was really hoping that we might end up becoming friends after all of the squabbling. But from the bottom of my heart, I urge you not to throw your life away. That would be meaningless…. I’m actually starting to get the feeling that the sovereign doesn’t want me to have a new master. The old fart!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, whatever. The most important thing is that you stay alive. You might not be able to pass the hundredth level, but at least you have some authority with the fan. We can work together! Don’t worry, I’ll help you do whatever you need.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter three days, Bai Xiaochun was fairly drunk, and the spirit automaton was jabbering about how terrifying the hundredth level was. Suddenly, Bai Xiaochun put his alcohol jug down and looked over at the spirit automaton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since when did you become so considerate?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve always been this way!” the spirit automaton replied in dead earnest. Sounding like the epitome of righteousness, he said, “You think I was doing all that just to make things hard for you? Wrong! I was trying to save you! I don’t want the old fart to get his way and kill you! I want you to live! That way I’ll have someone to chat with…. You have no idea what it\u0027s like to be me. I\u0027ve been here for so many tens of thousands of years that I\u0027ve already lost track of time. It’s so lonely….” He sighed again, a bitter look in his eyes as he stared off into the distance, but at the same time, peered cautiously at Bai Xiaochun out of the corner of his eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun, tipsy, looked over at the spirit automaton, and realized that something definitely seemed suspicious. Suddenly, he shot to his feet, and then pretended to let out a stream of uproarious laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re trying to pull a fast one!” he said. “You don’t want me to go into the hundredth level, do you?!”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartled, the spirit automaton leapt to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m not lying! You absolutely, positively must not go into that level! I don\u0027t want you to die!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon seeing the spirit automaton’s reaction, Bai Xiaochun’s eyes glittered, more suspicious than ever. Snorting coldly, he began to walk toward the fan rib.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see through your little scheme!” he said loudly, picking up his pace as he headed forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spirit automaton was so nervous that he was about to cry. Scrambling after Bai Xiaochun, he bitterly said, “You have to believe me! Don’t do this! I don\u0027t want to lose you…. Arrghhh! Why won’t you trust me!? I have your best interests at heart!”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more the spirit automaton babbled, the more suspicious Bai Xiaochun got. He also kept moving faster until he was right outside of the hundredth level. There, he lifted up his foot as if to step into the level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning, he glared and said, “Tell me the truth, you little automaton. The level\u0027s fake, isn’t it!?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spirit automaton’s heart seized momentarily, and he stood there blankly, looking as if he might start crying at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Bai Xiaochun saw how he was standing there seemingly at a loss for words, his mood instantly improved. Stepping down, he vanished, to reappear within the hundredth level. Everything happened exactly the same as before, with shocking energy filling the area, as well as a destructive, murderous aura.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sudden pressure sobered him up significantly, whereupon he shivered in fear and began to wail inwardly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was the spirit automaton really comforting me? Or is he actually trying to get me killed? Dammit! I\u0027m not really going to be stymied by the last level, am I?” Feeling like he was going crazy, he watched as the projection of the sovereign approached, causing the entire world to tremble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Challenger, are you ready?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the world trembled, Bai Xiaochun’s eyes turned completely bloodshot. He knew that if he chickened out again, not only would it be much harder for him to reach the Archaean Realm, but it would also be highly unlikely that anyone would become the rightful owner of the fan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had worked very hard to reach this point. And all the while, the cultivators from the Heavenspan Realm were suffering. Thinking back to what had happened in the imperial palace, he suddenly threw caution to the wind and shouted, “Bring it on!!”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePulling out the turtle-wok, which had returned to him of its own accord after the previous level, he put it on his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m ready, fool!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sovereign’s eyes flickered as he looked at Bai Xiaochun, and then extended his hand. Bai Xiaochun immediately unleashed the full power of his cultivation base and fleshly body, and prepared to fight back against the sovereign. However, it was in completely unexpected fashion that the sovereign merely reached out and bopped the turtle-wok.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then… there was no tempest. There was no surge of energy. There were no fluctuations. After bopping the turtle wok, a very serious expression overtook the sovereign’s face, and he nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, since you’re ready, then you pass. Congratulations! You are my successor. Many years have passed since the war of the starry sky, and this projection of mine is already growing very weak. The time has come to leave. Treat Xiao Chi well. I hope that, as my successor, you can tread the path that I never walked to the end. Remember my name…. I was a sovereign of the Immortal World. Zhou Chen!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe projection of the sovereign smiled faintly at him, then turned, floated up into the sky, and faded away into nothing….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun stood there in a bit of a daze, the turtle-wok still perched on his head. The sovereign was gone, but for some reason, he felt like he was in a dream. It seemed completely unreal. He even looked around a bit, and then down at himself to make sure he was real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter confirming that he was in fact standing there, he felt even more confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh? I passed, just like that? I won?” Feeling very uncertain about the whole thing, he cautiously left the level and returned to the fan rib. As he did, countless fluctuating streams of bright light shot up from the fan and flowed directly toward him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they fused with him, his fluctuations of control over the fan erupted out in all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two sets of fluctuations instantly formed some sort of resonance, causing all of the levels in the fan ribs to unlock, and filling him with the sensation that a single thought on his part could control the entire fan!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChest heaving, he finally came to the realization that… he really had passed the hundredth level!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he wanted, he could change the direction the fan flew in! It was under his complete control! His heart surged with nearly uncontrollable excitement at all of the powers of the fan that he now had at his disposal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The little automaton really was trying to pull a fast one!”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of a sudden, he shouted in a loud voice, “Alright, little automaton, get the hell out here! Lord Bai wants to talk!!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1182\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1184\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1183","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:11 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:11 AM"}
