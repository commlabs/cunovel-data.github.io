Ron responded by maintaining an unnaturally somber demeanor in her presence as an outward sign of continuing remorse. In fact, when all three of them were together Harry felt like the only non-mourner at a poorly attended funeral. During those few moments he spent alone with Harry, however (collecting water and searching the undergrowth for mushrooms). Ron became shamelessly cheery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone helped us,\" he kept saying, \"Someone sent that doe, Someone\u0027s on our side, One Horcrux down, mate!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBolstered by the destruction of the locket they set to debating the possible locations of the other Horcruxes and even though they had discussed the matter so often before. Harry felt optimistic, certain that more breakthroughs would succeed the first. Hermione\u0027s sulkiness could not mar his buoyant spirits; The sudden upswing in their fortunes, the appearance of the mysterious due, the recovery of Gryffindor\u0027s sword, and above all, Ron\u0027s return made Harry so happy that it was quite difficult to maintain a straight face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLate in the afternoon he and Ron escaped Hermione\u0027s baleful presence again and under the pretense of scouring the bare hedges for nonexistent blackberries, they continued their ongoing exchange of news. Harry had finally managed to tell Ron the whole story of his and Hermione\u0027s various wanderings, right up to the full story of what had happened at Godric\u0027s Hollow; Ron was now filling Harry in on everything he had discovered about the wider Wizarding world during his weeks away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... and how did you find out about the Taboo?\" he asked Harry after explaining the many desperate attempts of Muggle-borns to evade the Ministry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and Hermione have stopped saying You-Know-Who\u0027s name!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah, Well, it\u0027s just a bad habit we\u0027ve slipped into,\" said Harry. \"But I haven\u0027t got a problem calling him V ¨C\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"NO!\" roared Ron, causing Harry to jump into the hedge and Hermione (nose buried in a book at the tent entrance) to scowl over at them. \"Sorry,\" said Ron, wrenching Harry back out of the brambles, \"but the name\u0027s been jinxed, Harry, that\u0027s how they track people! Using his name breaks protective enchantments, it causes some kind of magical disturbance ¨C it\u0027s how they found us in Tottenham Court Road!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because we used his *name*?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly! You\u0027ve got to give them credit, it makes sense. It was only people who were serious about standing up to him, like Dumbledore, who even dared use it. Now they\u0027ve put a Taboo on it, anyone who says it is trackable ¨C quick-and-easy way to find Order members! They nearly got Kingsley ¨C\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re kidding?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, a bunch of Death Eaters cornered him, Bill said but he fought his way out. He\u0027s on the run now just like us.\" Ron scratched his chin thoughtfully with the end of his wand. \"You don\u0027t reckon Kingsley could have sent that doe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His Patronus is a lynx, we saw it at the wedding, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey moved farther along the hedge, away from the tent and Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry... you don\u0027t reckon it could\u0027ve been Dumbledore?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dumbledore what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon looked a little embarrassed, but said in a low voice, \"Dumbledore... the doe? I mean,\" Ron was watching Harry out of the corners of his eyes, \"he had the real sword last, didn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry did not laugh at Ron, because he understood too well the longing behind the question. The idea that Dumbledore had managed to come back to them, that he was watching over them, would have inexpressibly comforting. He shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dumbledore\u0027s dead,\" he said. \"I saw it happen, I saw the body. He\u0027s definitely gone. Anyway his Patronus was a phoenix, not a doe\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Patronuses can change, though can\u0027t they?\" said Ron, \"Tonks\u0027s changed didn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but if Dumbledore was alive, why wouldn\u0027t he show himself? Why wouldn\u0027t he just hand us the sword?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Search me,\" said Ron. \"Same reason he didn\u0027t give it to you while he was alive? Same reason he left you an old Snitch and Hermione a book of kid\u0027s stories?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is what?\" asked Harry, turning to look Ron full in the face desperate for the answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dunno,\" said Ron. \"Sometimes I\u0027ve thought, when I\u0027ve been a bit hacked off, he was having a laugh or ¨C or he just wanted to make it more difficult, But I don\u0027t think so, not anymore. He knew what he was doing when he gave me the Deluminator, didn\u0027t he? He ¨C well,\" Ron\u0027s ears turned bright red and he became engrossed in a tuft of grass at his feet, which he prodded with his toe, \"he must\u0027ve known I\u0027d run out on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Harry corrected him. \"He must\u0027ve known you\u0027d always want to come back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon looked grateful, but still awkward. Partly to change the subject, Harry said, \"Speaking of Dumbledore, have you heard what Skeeter wrote about him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah,\" said Ron at once, \"people are talking about it quite a lot. \u0027Course, if things were different it\u0027d be huge news, Dumbledore being pals with Grindelwald, but now it\u0027s just something to laugh about for people who didn\u0027t like Dumbledore, and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone who thought he was such a good bloke. I don\u0027t know that it\u0027s such a big deal, though. He was really young when they ¨C\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our age,\" said Harry, just as he had retorted to Hermione, and something in his face seemed to decide Ron against pursuing the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA large spider sat in the middle of a frosted web in the brambles. Harry took aim at it with the wand Ron had given him the previous night, which Hermione had since condescended to examine, and had decided was made of blackthorn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"*Engorgio*\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spider gave a little shiver, bouncing slightly in the web. Harry tried again. This time the spider grew slightly larger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop that,\" said Ron sharply, \" I\u0027m sorry I said Dumbledore was young, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry had forgotten Ron\u0027s hatred of spiders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry ¨C *Reducio*\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spider did not shrink. Harry looked down at the blackthorn wand. Every minor spell he had cast with it so far that day had seemed less powerful than those he had produced with his phoenix wand. The new one felt intrusively unfamiliar, like having somebody else\u0027s hand sewn to the end of his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just need to practice,\" said Hermione, who had approached them noiselessly from behind and had stood watching anxiously as Harry tried to enlarge and reduce the spider. \"It\u0027s all a matter of confidence Harry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew why she wanted it to be all right; She still felt guilty about breaking his wand. He bit back the retort that sprung to his lips, that she could take the blackthorn wand if she thought it made no difference, and he would have hers instead. Keen for them all to be friends again, however, he agreed; but when Ron gave Hermione a tentative smile, she stalked off and vanished behind her book once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll three of them returned to the tent when darkness fell, and Harry took first watch. Sitting in the entrance, he tried to make the blackthorn wand levitate small stones at his feet; but his magic still seemed clumsier and less powerful than it had done before. Hermione was lying on her bunk reading, while Ron, after many nervous glances up at her, had taken a small wooden wireless out of his rucksack and started to try to tune it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s this one program,\" he told Harry in a low voice, \"that tells the news like it really is. All the others are on You-Know-Who\u0027s side and are following the Ministry line, but this one... you wait till you hear it, it\u0027s great. Only they can\u0027t do it every night, they have to keep changing locations in case they\u0027re raided and you need a password to tune in... Trouble is, I missed the last one...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drummed lightly on the top of the radio with his wand muttering random words under his breath. He threw Hermione many covert glances, plainly fearing an angry outburst, but for all the notice she took of him he might not have been there. For ten minutes or so Ron tapped and muttered, Hermione turned the pages of her book, and Harry continued to practice with the blackthorn wand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally Hermione climbed down from her bunk. Ron ceased his tapping at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it\u0027s annoying you, I\u0027ll stop!\" he told Hermione nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione did not deign to respond, but approached Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to talk,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at the book still clutched in her hand. It was * The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore.*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" he said apprehensively. It flew through his mind that there was a chapter on him in there; he was not sure he felt up to hearing Rita\u0027s version of his relationship with Dumbledore. Hermione\u0027s answer however, was completely unexpected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Xenophilius Lovegood, Luna\u0027s father. I want to go and talk to him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er ¨C why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath, as though bracing herself, and said, \"It\u0027s that mark, the mark in Beedle the Bard. Look at this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thrust The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore under Harry\u0027s unwilling eyes and saw a photograph of the original letter that Dumbledore had written Grindelwald, with Dumbledore\u0027s familiar thin, slanting handwriting. He hated seeing absolute proof that Dumbledore really had written those words, that they had not been Rita\u0027s invention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The signature,\" said Hermione. \"Look at the signature, Harry!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe obeyed. For a moment he had no idea what she was talking about, but, looking more closely with the aid of his lit wand, he saw that Dumbledore had replaced the A of Albus with a tiny version of the same triangular mark inscribed upon The Tales of Beedle the Bard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er ¨C what are you ¨C?\" said Ron tentatively, but Hermione quelled him with a look and turned back to Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It keeps cropping up, doesn\u0027t it?\" she said. \"I know Viktor said it was Grindelwald\u0027s mark, but it was definitely on that old grave in Godric\u0027s Hollow, and the dates on the headstone were long before Grindelwald came along! And now this! Well, we can\u0027t ask Dumbledore or Grindelwald what it means ¨C I don\u0027t even know whether Grindelwald\u0027s still alive ¨C but we can ask Mr. Lovegood. He was wearing the symbol at the wedding. I\u0027m sure this is important, Harry!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry did not answer immediately. He looked into her intense, eager face and then out into the surrounding darkness, thinking. After a long pause he said, \"Hermione, we don\u0027t need another Godric\u0027s Hollow. We talked ourselves into going there, and ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it keeps appearing, Harry! Dumbledore left me The Tales of Beedle the Bard, how do you know we\u0027re not supposed to find out about the sign?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here we go again!\" Harry felt slightly exasperated. \"We keep trying to convince ourselves Dumbledore left us secret signs and clues ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Deluminator turned out to be pretty useful,\" piped up Ron. \"I think Hermione\u0027s right, I think we ought to go and see Lovegood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry threw him a dark look. He was quite sure that Ron\u0027s support of Hermione had little to do with a desire to know the meaning of the triangular rune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It won\u0027t be like Godric\u0027s Hollow,\" Ron added, \"Lovegood\u0027s on your side, Harry, The Quibbler\u0027s been for you all along, it keeps telling everyone they\u0027ve got to help you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure this is important!\" said Hermione earnestly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But don\u0027t you think if it was, Dumbledore would have told me about it before he died?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe... maybe it\u0027s something you need to find out for yourself,\" said Hermione with a faint air of clutching at straws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" said Ron sycophantically, \"that makes sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it doesn\u0027t,\" snapped Hermione, \"but I still think we ought to talk to Mr. Lovegood. A symbol that links Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Godric\u0027s Hollow? Harry, I\u0027m sure we ought to know about this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we should vote on it,\" said Ron. \"Those in favor of going to see Love good ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand flew into the air before Hermione\u0027s. Her lips quivered suspiciously as she raised her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Outvoted, Harry, sorry,\" said Ron, clapping him on the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" said Harry, half amused, half irritated. \"Only, once we\u0027ve seen Lovegood, let\u0027s try and look for some more Horcruxes, shall we? Where do the Lovegood\u0027s live, anyway? Do either of you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, they\u0027re not far from my place,\" said Ron. \"I dunno exactly where, but Mum and Dad always point toward the hills whenever they mention them. Shouldn\u0027t be hard to find.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Hermione had returned to her bunk, Harry lowered his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You only agreed to try and get back in her good books.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All\u0027s fair in love and war,\" said Ron brightly, \"and this is a bit of both. Cheer up, it\u0027s the Christmas holidays, Luna\u0027ll be home!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had an excellent view of the village of Ottery St. Catchopole from the breezy hillside to which they Disapparated next morning. From their high vantage point the village looked like a collection of toy houses in the great slanting shafts of sunlight stretching to earth in the breaks between clouds. They stood for a minute or two looking toward the Burrow, their hands shadowing their eyes, but all they could make out were the high hedges and trees of the orchard, which afforded the crooked little house protection from Muggle eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s weird, being this near, but not going to visit,\" said Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s not like you haven\u0027t just seen them. You were there for Christmas,\" said Hermione coldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t at the Burrow!\" said Ron with an incredulous laugh. \"Do you think I was going to go back there and tell them all I\u0027d walked out on you? Yeah, Fred and George would\u0027ve been great about it. And Ginny, she\u0027d have been really understanding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But where have you been, then?\" asked Hermione, surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bill and Fleur\u0027s new place. Shell cottage. Bill\u0027s always been decent to me. He ¨C he wasn\u0027t impressed when he heard what I\u0027d done, but he didn\u0027t go on about it. He knew I was really sorry. None of the rest of the family know I was there. Bill told Mum he and Fleur weren\u0027t going home for Christmas because they wanted to spend it alone. You know, first holiday after they were married. I don\u0027t think Fleur minded. You know how much she hates Celestina Warbeck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon turned his back on the Burrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s try up here,\" he said, leading the way over the top of the hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked for a few hours, Harry, at Hermione\u0027s insistence, hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak. The cluster of low hills appeared to be uninhabited apart from one small cottage, which seemed deserted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think it\u0027s theirs, and they\u0027ve gone away for Christmas?\" said Hermione, peering through the window at a neat little kitchen with geraniums on the windowsill. Ron snorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, I\u0027ve got a feeling you\u0027d be able to tell who lived there if you looked through the Lovegoods\u0027 window. Let\u0027s try the next lot of hills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo they Disapparated a few miles farther north.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aha!\" shouted Ron, as the wind whipped their hair and clothes. Ron was pointing upward, toward the top of the hill on which they had appeared, where a most strange-looking house rose vertically against the sky, a great black cylinder with a ghostly moon hanging behind it in the afternoon sky. \"That\u0027s got to be Luna\u0027s house, who else would live in a place like that? It looks like a giant rook!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s nothing like a bird,\" said Hermione, frowning at the tower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was talking about a chess rook,\" said Ron. \"A castle to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon\u0027s legs were the longest and he reached the top of the hill first. When Harry and Hermione caught up with him, panting and clutching stitches in their sides, they found him grinning broadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s theirs,\" said Ron. \"Look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree hand-painted signs had been tacked to a broke-down gate. The first read,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE QUIBBLER. EDITOR, X.

The zigzagging path leading to the front door was overgrown with a variety of odd plants, including a bush covered in orange radishlike fruit Luna sometimes wore as earrings. Harry thought he recognized a Snargaluff and gave the wizened stump a wide berth. Two aged crab apple trees, bent with the wind, stripped of leaves but still heavy with berry-sized red fruits and bushy crowns of white beaded mistletoe, stood sentinel on either side of the front door. A little owl with a slightly flattened hawklike head peered down at them from one of the branches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d better take off the Invisibility Cloak, Harry,\" said Hermione. \"It\u0027s you Mr. Lovegood wants to help, not us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did as she suggested, handing her the Cloak to stow in the beaded bag. She then rapped three times on the thick black door, which was studded with iron nails and bore a knocker shaped like an eagle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarely ten seconds passed, then the door was flung open and there stood Xenophilius Lovegood, barefoot and wearing what appeared to be a stained nightshirt. His long white candyfloss hair was dirty and unkempt. Xenophilius had been positively dapper at Bill and Fleur\u0027s wedding by comparison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? What is it? Who are you? What do you want?\" he cried in a high-pitched, querulous voice, looking first at Hermione, then at Ron, and finally at Harry, upon which his mouth fell open in a perfect, comical O.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Mr. Lovegood,\" said Harry, holding out his hand, \"I\u0027m Harry, Harry Potter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXenophilius did not take Harry\u0027s hand, although the eye that was not pointing inward at his nose slid straight to the scar on Harry\u0027s forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would it be okay if we came in?\" asked Harry. \"There\u0027s something we\u0027d like to ask you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... I\u0027m not sure that\u0027s advisable,\" whispered Xenophilius, He swallowed and cast a quick look around the garden. \"Rather a shock... My word... I... I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t really think I ought to ¨C\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wont take long\" said Harry, slightly disappointed by this less-than-warm welcome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ¨C oh, all right then. Come in, quickly, Quickly!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were barely over the threshold when Xenophilius slammed the door shut behind them, They were standing in the most peculiar kitchen Harry had ever seen. The room was perfectly circular, so that he felt like being inside a giant pepper pot. Everything was curved to fit the walls ¨C the stove, the sink, and the cupboards ¨C and all of it had been painted with flowers, insects, and birds in bright primary colors. Harry thought he recognized Luna\u0027s styles. The effect in such and enclosed space, was slightly overwhelming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the middle of the floor, a wrought-iron spiral staircase led to the upper levels. There was a great deal of clattering and banging coming from overhead: Harry wondered what Luna could be doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d better come up.\" said Xenophilius, still looking extremely uncomfortable, and he led the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room above seemed to be a combination of living room and workplace, and as such, was even more cluttered than the kitchen. Though much smaller and entirely round, the room somewhat resembled the Room of Requirement on the unforgettable occasion that it had transformed itself into a gigantic labyrinth comprised of centuries of hidden objects. There were piles upon piles of books and papers on every surface. Delicately made models of creatures Harry did not recognize, all flapping wings or snapping jaws, hung from the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuna was not there: The thing that was making such a racket was a wooden object covered in magically turning cogs and wheels, It looked like the bizarre offspring of a workbench and a set of shelves, but after a moment Harry deduced that it was an old-fashioned printing press, due to the fact that it was churning out Quibblers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me,\" said Xenophilius, and he strode over to the machine, seized grubbily tablecloth from beneath an immense number of books and papers, which all tumbled onto the floor, and threw it over the press, somewhat muffling the loud bangs and clatters. He then faced Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why have you come here?\" Before Harry could speak, however, Hermione let out a small cry of shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Lovegood ¨C what\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee was pointing at an enormous, gray spiral horn, not unlike that of a unicorn, which had been mounted on the wall, protruding several feet into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is the horn of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack,\" said Xenophilius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No it isn\u0027t!\" said Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hermione,\" muttered Harry, embarrassed, \"now\u0027s not the moment ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Harry, it\u0027s an Erumpent horn! It\u0027s a Class B Tradeable Material and it\u0027s an extraordinary dangerous thing to have in a house!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d you know it\u0027s an Erumpent horn?\" asked Ron, edging away from the horn as fast as he could, given the extreme clutter of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a description in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them! Mr. Lovegood, you need to get rid of it straightaway, don\u0027t you know it can explode at the slightest touch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Crumple Horned Snorkack\" said Xenophilius very clearly, a mulish look upon his face, \"is a shy and highly magical creature, and it\u0027s horn ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Lovegood. I recognize the grooved markings around the base, that\u0027s an Erumpent horn and it\u0027s incredibly dangerous ¨C I don\u0027t know where you got it-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bought it,\" said Xenophilius dogmatically. \"Two weeks ago, from a delightful young wizard who knew my interest in the exquisite Snorkack. A Christmas surprise for my Luna. Now,\" he said, turning to Harry, \"why exactly have you come here, Mr. Potter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need some help,\" said Harry, before Hermione could start again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah,\" said Xenophilius, \"Help, Hmm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis good eye moved again to Harry\u0027s scar. He seemed simultaneously terrified and mesmerized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. The thing is... helping Harry Potter... rather dangerous...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you the one who keeps telling everyone it\u0027s their first duty to help Harry?\" said Ron. \"In that magazine of yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXenophilius glanced behind him at the concealed printing press, still banging and clattering beneath the tablecloth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er ¨C yes, I have expressed that view. however ¨C \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s for everyone else to do, not you personally?\" said Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXenophilius did not answer. He kept swallowing, his eyes darting between the three of them. Harry had the impression that he was undergoing some painful internal struggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Luna?\" asked Hermione. \"Let\u0027s see what she thinks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXenophilius gulped. He seemed to be steeling himself. Finally he said in a shaky voice difficult to hear over the noise of the printing press, \"Luna is down at the stream, fishing for Freshwater Plimpies. She...she will like to see you. I\u0027ll go and call her and then ¨C yes, very well. I shall try to help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe disappeared down the spiral staircase and they heard the front open and close. They looked at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cowardly old wart,\" said Ron. \"Luna\u0027s got ten times his guts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s probably worried about what\u0027ll happen to them if the Death Eaters find out I was here\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I agree with Ron,\" said Hermione, \"Awful old hypocrite, telling everyone else to help you and trying to worm our of it himself. And for heaven\u0027s sake keep away from that horn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry crossed to the window on the far side of the room. He could see a stream, a thin, glittering ribbon lying far below them at the base of the hill. They were very high up; a bird fluttered past the window as he stared in the direction of the Burrow, now invisible beyond another line of hills. Ginny was over there somewhere. They were closer to each other today than they had been since Bill and Fleur\u0027s wedding, but she could have no idea he was gazing toward her now, thinking of her. He suppose he ought to be glad of it; anyone he came into contact with was in danger, Xenophilius\u0027s attitude proved that. he turned away from the windows and his gaze fell upon another peculiar object standing upon the cluttered, curved slide board; a stone but of a beautiful but austere-looking witch wearing a most bizarre-looking headdress. Two objects that resembled golden ear trumpets curved out from the sides. A tiny pair of glittering blue wing was stuck to a leather strap that ran over the top of her head, while one of the orange radishes had been stuck to a second strap around her forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at this,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fetching,\" said Ron. \"Surprised he didn\u0027t wear that to the wedding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey heard the front door close, and a moment later Xenophilius climbed back up the spiral staircase into the room, his thin legs now encase in Wellington boots, bearing a tray of ill-assorted teacups and a steaming teapot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, you have spotted my pet invention,\" he said, shoving the tray into Hermione\u0027s arms and joining Harry at the statue\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Modeled, fittingly enough, upon the head of the beautiful Rowens Ravenclaw, \u0027Wit beyond measure is a man\u0027s greatest treasure!\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe indicated the objects like ear trumpets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These are the Wrackpurt siphons ¨C to remove all sources of distraction from the thinker\u0027s immediate area. Here,\" he pointed out the tiny wings, \"a billywig propeller, to induce an elevated frame of mind. Finally,\" he pointed to the orange radish, \"the dirigible Plum, so as to enhance the ability to accept the extraordinary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXenophilius strode back to the tea tray, which Hermione had managed to balance precariously on one of the cluttered side tables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots?\" said Xenophilius. \"We make it ourselves.\" As he started to pour out the drink, which was as deeply purple as beetroot juice, he added, \"Luna is down beyond Bottom Bridge, she is most excited that you are here She ought not to be too long, she has caught nearly enough Plumpies to make soup for all of us. Do sit down and help yourselves to sugar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now,\" he remove a tottering pile of papers from an armchair and sat down, his Wellingtoned legs crossed, \"how may I help you, Mr. Potter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" said Harry, glancing at Hermione, who nodded encouragingly, \"it\u0027s about that symbol you were wearing around your neck at Bill and Fleur\u0027s wedding, Mr. Lovegood. We wondered what it meant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXenophilius raised his eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-harry-potter-7/page-20.html","bookId":1567,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:44:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:44:12 PM"}
