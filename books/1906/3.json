{"id":87347,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"\u003cp\u003eA man stood below her tree, watching her with intent brown eyes, like the creatures of the forest. No wet black nose, but his lips were definitely twitching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren yelped in surprise. Instinct had her arms flying up into bat position to cover her breasts.\"How long have you been standing there?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Awhile,\" he lifted a shoulder, studying her in a manner that was indeed animal-like. Humans didn\u0027t have such disconcertingly intent focus in their gazes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you say something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to mull that over. The unexpected silence stretched out between them. \"I didn\u0027t have anything to say,\" he said at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis had to be Josh. Since he was gay, he wasn\u0027t about to turn into a rutting beast and grapple up the tree to ravish her. Oh, screw it. He was a grown man and she was sure he had seen someone\u0027s breasts before hers. She hated the pathetic picture she imagined she made, so she forced herself to settle back against her natural backrest and readjust her arms to an akimbo position, so she wasn\u0027t flaunting herself, but she wasn\u0027t cowering either. His glance seemed to follow the movement of every muscle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you intend to be around awhile?\" she said, exasperated when he said nothing further, just continued to study her. His hair was a variety of rich browns streaked with blonde. It fell in uneven lengths to his shoulders, just grazing the top of his tanned shoulder blades. He wore just a pair of jeans, so a great deal of that tan was exposed, as well as some intricate and stunning tattoos. Celtic designs manacled his biceps and wrists, and there was a dragon pattern on his flat belly just above his navel. It was beautiful work, and yet it did not quite fit him, which was a strange thought, since she had just met him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you\u0027re safe, I\u0027ll leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe simple and sincere statement shut down her ire and replaced it with embarrassment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll be okay,\" she assured him, though she felt no real assurance of that herself at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What makes you think I didn\u0027t climb out here intentionally?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze dropped to her bare upper torso, then slid over to the deck where the hot tub still gurgled and the closed sliding glass door reflected the last light of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" she said crossly, as if he\u0027d called her an idiot outright. \"Just...look somewhere else if you could. I mean, it\u0027s not like this - \" she glanced down, \"really does anything for you, but it\u0027s easier to concentrate on getting down if you\u0027re not staring at me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt embarrassed. Josh wished she could see herself as he was seeing her. She was perfect. She sat on the limb with her upper body straight, no attempt to hide the slope of her bare breasts, now that she was over her surprise. The towel knotted at her hip gave him an unimpeded view of one leg from hipbone to ankle. With her hair piled onto her head, tendrils of it wisping around her neck, she was both delicate and powerful, inciting a strong dual desire to protect her, and serve her every wish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was likely his prolonged isolation that made her so potent. If he saw her on a street corner, amid a bunch of other people, wearing jeans and a sweater, buying a paper, he\u0027d give her no more than a passing appreciative glance. Maybe. Regardless, thinking that didn\u0027t change his primitive reaction to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no props like that here to protect the senses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe politely shifted his gaze a couple inches, and his position a couple feet, as she began to attempt descent again. He wanted her in his peripheral vision if she began to fall. He wondered why she thought so little of her body that she thought he wouldn\u0027t be affected by it. This woman\u0027s figure was worth days of perusal. She had built up her strength while making sure her body stayed stylishly trim. He could see and appreciate that in the flex of her biceps and shifting long thigh muscles. He was obligated to wonder what it would feel like to have those muscles flexing against his hips. He could appreciate the curve of buttock her movement along the branch revealed. But Josh was first and foremost a breast man, and it was that which anchored his peripheral vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHers were firm and heavy, the delicate shadows of blue veins offering the tongue a path that he wouldn\u0027t mind tracing. He also wouldn\u0027t mind heating up the nipple in his mouth, feeling it go from the tight wrinkled point caused by the friction of the bark, to full hardness. He could imagine his lips and tongue soothing each red abrasion on the sensitive skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer bare foot reached the crotch of the tree and Josh gave her another moment or two to figure out the obvious, that her only choice was a fifteen-foot drop. The trunk of the ancient tree was far too large to shinny down unless she was part monkey, and the angle too steep, though she\u0027d done admirably well so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved back to the base and looked up. He was rewarded with an unencumbered view up the towel, her legs open as she braced one foot in the joining point of the tree and positioned the other foot higher, on the branch she had just traversed. The vision jolted him, the pink lips of her sex exposed by a neat shave. It was easy to imagine what those lips would look like, glistening with arousal, inviting him inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jerked his gaze up and made himself focus on the tendrils of blonde hair, tickling bare shoulders he\u0027d love to mark with a light swipe of his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a handy man,\" she said. \"A fix-it guy. Don\u0027t you have a ladder or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he nodded. \"My ladder is a mile away. If I go get it, you\u0027ll get impatient and try to come down by yourself. I\u0027ll find your body,\" his gaze shifted below them thoughtfully, \"in that ravine, and Lisette will be angry that I went to get my ladder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer chest started to heave with a touch of ire, distracting him. He raised his gaze back to her face and held it there, though the effort was making his eyes water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if I promised not to move?\" she said impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe liked the way she spoke, softness over steel, like she could order a man off of a cliff and make him want to do it. Realizing she was waiting for an answer, he lifted a shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know you,\" he said. \"So I don\u0027t know how good your word is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren stared down at him. Her entire escape to this island, at the moment, was taking on the appearance of an episode of Keystone Cops Go to Hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had envisioned herself having a flawless weekend of solitude, getting in touch with the inner Lauren, finding that calm, capable woman she knew was still in there somewhere. In short, she had imagined herself taking long contemplative walks on the beach, staring out at the waves, the heroine of a New Age self-discovery memoir. The woodland animals, feeling her amazing tranquility and strength, would approach her without fear and seek her touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was her vacation, dammit, and she was going to get on the ground, get into the house with a cup of hot chocolate, and read one of her books. She wouldn\u0027t start with a romance, one of those books where women ended up in ludicrous positions half-naked in front of strange, handsome men. Like that ever really happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, hell, if he wasn\u0027t used to the proper social niceties, pretending everything was okay when it wasn\u0027t, then she needn\u0027t work at it. Her legs folded up to her chest and Lauren sank into the crevice of the tree, the bark scraping yet another area of exposed skin, adding to the list of abrasions she would have to address later. She turned her back on him and leaned her head up against the branch. She shut her eyes tightly, but the bitter tears fought free anyway, a knot of them jamming up her throat. Resolve number one, not to cry a single tear while she was on this island, was in shambles for the second time in less than two hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe massaged her temples and jerked around as a warm hand touched her shoulder. She would have knocked him off her perch if he hadn\u0027t been prepared for her startled reaction to his climbing ability. He had one hand braced on the branch she had descended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren had a momentary impression of wide shoulders and penetrating gray eyes studying her tear-streaked face, then she was brought into his arms, his hands pressed against her bare back, his arms gathering her close and holding her surrounded by the shelter of chest and knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t an embrace that said, \"I\u0027m the big, strong man holding the feeble female\". It was a gentle, firm hold that offered her comfort, offered himself up as the tree she could lean upon for a moment or forever, however long it took.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stiffened at the absurd thought and he brought her closer, like she was a child curled in a fetal position. His careful, tender hands stroked her back, her hair, as he muttered soothingly to her. Lauren\u0027s head fell forward, her forehead coming into contact with his chest. He put his head over hers, accepting her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn\u0027t Jonathan. This was a total stranger, someone she didn\u0027t know, couldn\u0027t possibly trust...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren\u0027s arms shot out and she grabbed his lean, muscular bare back in both hands, dug in her fingers and held.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh was very conscious of her bare body pressed against his, the gentle pressure of her breasts, the nipples sliding against his chest as she hitched with those careful, silent sobs, but he wasn\u0027t a total cad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, not completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tipped up her chin with one finger and settled his lips over hers. Warmth, wet and friction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped in mid-sob, made a surprised noise, did that quick little panic jerk, then literally melted into it, her arms sliding down to his waist, her body settling against his, her side pressed against his tightening groin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t say what made him do it. He didn\u0027t know her, she was upset, she should react by screaming and tossing him out of the tree. Marcus said he was losing his ability to live in civilized society, that he was just starting to react in whatever manner his animal instincts dictated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he was right. Something about her said the kiss would be welcome, that it was essential he communicate how much he wanted her, right from the beginning. If they were on the level ground, he might have displayed it in an altogether more reverent fashion. A gentle kiss laid on the knuckles of her bare toes. He would brush his hair against her calf, an intentional caress as he raised his head for a brief look into her blue eyes, showing her his desire to please, and protect, and cherish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a strange thought, the type of thought he had never had before, but one that felt right as he thought of her again, sitting proudly in the tree gazing down at him, like a tribal goddess. His hands slid up to smooth shoulders and into her hair. He discovered spun silk, delicate ears, and a neck so fragile he could snap it with one hand. Good God, he wanted her, here and now, forever, and he didn\u0027t even know her name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren\u0027s first thought was that he was the best kisser, gay or straight; she\u0027d ever had the pleasure to experience. Her second thought was a revelation that uncoiled in her stomach and sent tendrils out to tug at her vitals. Just as homosexuals often knew another homosexual just from picking up vibes, so a Dominant could pick up the scent of a submissive. She felt it in Josh, but there was an oddness to it, almost as if it had been brought into consciousness and then buried again. He had powerful hands, but they were hesitant. Not hesitant as in awkward, but as if he paused at the door, waiting for the invitation because he couldn\u0027t enter without it. That was normal for a sub, but there was a wounded quality to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormally, that would send Lauren in full retreat. D/s, consensual as it was, involved a far more deeply emotional level of sexual interplay than most people engaged in, even those who had been partners for many years. Getting into it with someone excessively damaged could be dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweet baby, what happened to you, she wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this a private party, or can anyone join?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren jerked back, and Josh kept her from overbalancing with a sure grip on her shoulders. \"Marcus,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe explained to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren looked down at the man standing negligently at the base of the trunk, his face reflecting amusement. Her jaw dropped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer high school art teacher had told her class that Michelangelo\u0027s David was considered one of the most perfect depictions of the male form. Her high school art teacher had never seen Marcus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus was six foot even, his body layered in smooth muscle as if it had in fact been sculpted by an artist\u0027s fine touch. He displayed himself well in the same outfit as Josh, just a pair of jeans. She assumed they had both spent a sweaty day working on one of the houses. His dark hair was fine and flowing as her own, falling carelessly over a high forehead and to his shoulders. His sensual lips, curved in that mysterious smile, made her imagine all the places they might have been, and his green eyes were full of secret thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was more than riveting, he was familiar. She was in the middle of the Caribbean for the first time in her life. No one should look familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you use a hand? In the getting down department, that is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Can you see if Lisette has some rope in her workroom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"White knight, here to serve. Be right back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh nodded and looked down into Lauren\u0027s face. \"Think you can climb down a rope if I get you started?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren was trying to keep up with all the shifts and nodded dumbly to this latest suggestion. Josh touched her chin with a light fingertip, a trace of a shy smile flirting about his lips. \"Er... he\u0027s the one that wouldn\u0027t get anything out of looking at your body.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren swallowed. \"Lisette also told me... you weren\u0027t house-trained.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her a knowing look, but said only, \"She had one out of two things right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus emerged from Lisette\u0027s basement workroom and tossed up the end of a generous coil of rope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh tied it to the branch and then set his hands at Lauren\u0027s waist, his palms hot on her skin. The knot of her towel had tightened during her climb, so now the terry cloth rode low on her hips. His long fingers lay inside the circle of it, grazing her hip bones. She was sure he meant his touch to be a steadying thing, to help her take a firm grasp of the rope without having to worry about her balance. Unfortunately the effect of that warm, intimate touch had the exact opposite result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonathan\u0027s face flashed through her head, along with the memory of him sitting on the top stair to their second floor, dressed for work. It had been shortly before their breakup. She knelt between his knees, desperate for just a simple hug, the desire to be held. He had put his lips against her ear. \"You are so fucked up, Lauren.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had said it soothingly, reinforcing what she had come to believe about herself. Rather than feeling insulted, she had felt vindicated. Like having a doctor diagnose her illness, she felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude at having it acknowledged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren\u0027s skin crawled with the memory and her chin tightened. She knew how to climb down a damn rope. She was one of three women at the gym that could do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seized the rope and swung herself carefully into a descent position, blocking out for a moment that she was giving the man below, gay or not, a great view of her ass, and the one above quite a display of tits. Well, happiness and joy to them both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Focus,\" her personal trainer at the gym had told her. \"That\u0027s the key to getting to the top, and back down again. Never think that getting down is easier. That\u0027s when most accidents happen in climbing, because it\u0027s harder to control your descent. Psychologically your mind thinks it\u0027s made it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer current surroundings and situation were nothing like the gym, so perhaps it was understandable that the reminder of that lecture came after she lost her grip on the rope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren had time for a short shriek before she was falling, flailing through the air and then landing against another warm body. Marcus was knocked off balance by the weight of her hurtling body hitting him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey thudded to the ground in a twisted tangle of limbs and muttered curses and rolled several yards down the steep incline before he managed to catch onto a protruding root and bring them to a halt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLauren attempted to extricate her limbs from Marcus enough to turn and find out if he was all right. She found he was trying to do the same, but they managed it. Josh was coming down quickly, no hesitation, she noted sourly. She comforted herself with appreciation for the ripple of tense power across the shoulders and down his back, the way the jeans rode lower with his arms above his head and stomach muscles contracted tight. That\u0027s the way they\u0027d be if his arms were tied at the wrists to a suspension bar, pulled just high enough to keep him on the balls of his feet, so his buttock muscles would be firm and clenched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoa, where had that thought come from? A silly grin twisted her lips. It was a tasty image, though. She shifted her focus to the one who had broken her fall. Marcus had pushed himself up on his elbows, and his lip was cut where her elbow had landed. \"Are you all right?\" she reached out to it, at the same time he offered a solicitous hand to that same offending elbow and said, \"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe managed a crooked grin. \"We must be, if we\u0027re both more concerned about each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said, smiling back. \"You\u0027re male, and so you can\u0027t admit you\u0027re in terrible pain, and I\u0027m female and so naturally would always ask about the well-being of others before my own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another woman with an overabundance of therapy,\" he observed, turning his hand into a position to offer a courteous handshake, despite her current lack of clothing. \"I\u0027m Marcus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lauren,\" she shook his hand and then cocked a brow at Josh. \"And I think we met in the tree.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which explains why you flung yourself out of it,\" Marcus noted dryly. \"Perfectly understandable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh shot him a deprecating look, then turned his attention back to Lauren. She noted with some amusement his determination to keep his gaze fixed on her face. \"Are you sure you\u0027re all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so.\" Lauren found her knees a bit unsteady as she rolled to them. She put her hand to the forest floor to push herself up. A pair of male hands supported her at either elbow, and she gazed down at her half-naked torso, stained with dirt and leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, this has been an adventurous day,\" she murmured to no one in particular, though she thought she heard Marcus chuckle. She was going to adjust that towel, as soon as she could discreetly turn away from the two men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her weight down on her right foot and gasped, grabbing at Josh\u0027s arm to keep her balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSprain. Probably not a bad one, but just one more delightful thing to add to the day\u0027s charm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus squatted and ran his hand along the back of her calf, down to the injured member. \"Already swelling,\" he confirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had been sucked into some parallel dimension, where every tawdry cliche from a cheap romance novel was going to be played out. If everything went true to form, one of the men, probably the one she found most irritating yet mysteriously irresistible, would swing her easily up into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, then,\" Josh nodded, hooked her arms around his neck, bent and scooped her up. \"We\u0027ll take you back upstairs and get that wrapped.\" He lifted a brow at her snort of laughter. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" Lauren shook her head. \"Nothing at all.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/holding-the-cards-nature-of-desire-1/page-3.html","bookId":1906,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:21:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:21:08 PM"}
