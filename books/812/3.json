I wanted to talk to you about father—no, please don\u0027t go,\" to Verneede, who had[Pg 13] made a little movement as if to say \"Am I de trop?\" \"You are both so clever I\u0027m sure you will be able to give me good advice.

So it is with brains. Mr Leavesley for a moment sat contemplating the crazy plan propounded by Mr Verneede. Then he broke into a laugh. His imagination pictured the interview between Miss Lambert and his uncle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, go ahead,\" he said. \"Perhaps you\u0027re right; I don\u0027t know much about the law, but, anyhow, it\u0027s not a hanging matter.

Come.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They left the studio.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The prospect of having Miss Lambert all alone to himself in a cab made the heart of Mr Leavesley palpitate, mixed emotions filled his soul. Blue funk was the basis of these emotions. He was going to propose, so he told himself, immediately, the instant they were in the cab and the horse had started. That was all very well as a statement made to himself: it did not conceal the fact that Miss Lambert was a terribly difficult girl to propose to. One of those jolly girls who treat one as a brother are generally the most difficult to deal with when one approaches them as a lover. But Miss Lambert, besides the fact of her[Pg 19] jollity and her treatment of Mr Leavesley as a brother, had a personality all her own. She seemed to him a combination of the practical and the unpractical in about equal proportions, one could never tell how she would take things.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They walked down the King\u0027s Road looking for a cab, Miss Lambert and Verneede engaged in vivacious conversation, Leavesley silent, engaged in troubled attempts to think.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I give a few links from the chain of his thoughts just as a specimen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Fanny, I love you—no, I can\u0027t say that, it\u0027s too bald and brutal. Miss Lambert, I have long wanted to—oh, rubbish! How would it do to take her hand—I daren\u0027t—bother!—does she care a button about me? Perhaps it would be better to put it off till the next time—I\u0027m not going to funk it—may I call you Fanny?—or Fanny—may I call you Fanny? or Miss Lambert may I call you Fanny? How would it be to write? No, I\u0027ll do it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They stopped, Mr Verneede had hailed a cab, and Leavesley came out of his reverie to find a four-wheeler drawing up at the pavement.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 20]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hullo,\" he said to Verneede, \"what did you call that thing for?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To drive in,\" replied Fanny, whilst Verneede opened the door. \"Get in, I\u0027m in a horrible fright.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But,\" said Leavesley, \"a four-wheeler—why not a hansom?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, no,\" said Miss Lambert, getting into the vehicle, \"I hate hansoms, I was thrown out of one once. Besides, this is more respectable. Do get in quick, and tell the man to drive fast; I want to get the agony over.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Corner of Southampton Row,\" cried Leavesley to the driver. He got in, Verneede shut the door and stood on the pavement, bowing and smiling in an antiquated way as they drove off.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a four-wheeler with pretensions in the form of maroon velveteen cushions and rubber tyres, a would-be imitation brougham, but the old growler blood came out in its voice, every window rattled. Driving in it, one could hear oneself speak, but conversation with a companion to be intelligible had to be conducted in a mild shout.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t in the least know what I\u0027m going to say to him,\" cried Miss Lambert, leaning[Pg 21] forward towards her companion—he was seated opposite to her on the front seat. \"I\u0027m so nervous, I can\u0027t think.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t go to him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I must, now we\u0027ve taken the cab.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Let\u0027s go somewhere else.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Anywhere—Madame Tussaud\u0027s.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, no, I\u0027m going. Don\u0027t let\u0027s talk of it, let\u0027s talk of something pleasant.\" She opened her purse, turned its meagre contents into her lap, and examined some bills that were stuffed into a side compartment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s two-and-six, and three shillings, and eighteen pence?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Eight shillings, I think,\" answered Leavesley after a moment\u0027s thought.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then I\u0027ve lost a shilling,\" pouted Miss Lambert, counting her money, replacing it, and closing the purse with a snap. \"No matter, let\u0027s think of something pleasant. Isn\u0027t old Mr Verneede sweet?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Fanny,\" said Leavesley, ignoring the saccharine possibilities of Mr Verneede—\"may I call you Fanny?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course, every one does. I say, is this cabman taking us right?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 22]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, quite.

Some day next week—only father is going away next week, and a picnic would be nothing without him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Suppose you and I and Verneede went for a picnic next week?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That would be fun,\" said the girl; \"we can make tea—oh, don\u0027t let us talk of picnics, I feel miserable.

At the corner of Southampton Row it stopped. They got out, and Leavesley paid and dismissed the driver.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s the house down there,\" said he, \"No. —.

Now I\u0027m going.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She tripped off, and Leavesley watched her flitting by the grim, business-like houses. She turned for a second, glanced back, and then No. — engulfed her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Leavesley waited, trying to picture to himself[Pg 24] the interview that was in progress. Trying to fancy what Miss Lambert was saying to Mr James Hancock, and what Mr James Hancock was saying to Miss Lambert.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Surely no one in London could have suggested such a proceeding except Verneede, a proceeding so hopelessly insane from a business point of view.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To call on your adversary\u0027s solicitor, and tell him to cease because he was worrying your father to death!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Besides, Lambert was the man who ought to cease, because it was Lambert who was the plaintiff.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Punching a man\u0027s head, and then telling him to cease!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr Leavesley burst into a laugh that caused a passing old lady to hurry on her way.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He waited. Five minutes passed, ten, fifteen; what was happening?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was nearly closing time at the office. Twenty minutes passed. Could James Hancock really have devoured Fanny in a fit of gout and irritation?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He saw Bridgewater, the old chief clerk, come out and make off down Southampton Row with a bag in his hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 25]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Three-quarters of an hour had gone, and Leavesley had taken his watch out for the twentieth time, when from the doorway of No. — Fanny appeared, a glimmer of blue like a butterfly just broken from its chrysalis.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Leavesley made two steps towards her, then he paused. Immediately after Fanny came James Hancock, umbrella in hand, and hat on the back of his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was accompanying her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fanny glanced in Leavesley\u0027s direction, and then she and her companion walked away down Southampton Row, Hancock walking with his long stride; Fanny trotting beside him, neither, apparently, speaking one to the other.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Leavesley followed full of amazement.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He could tell from his uncle\u0027s manner of walking, and from the way he wore his hat, that he was either irritated or perplexed. He walked hurriedly, and, viewed from behind, he had the appearance of a physician who was going to an urgent case.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Much marvelling, the artist followed. He saw Hancock hail a passing four-wheeler, and open the door.
