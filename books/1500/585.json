In her left hand was a letter that she was slowly reading, in her right a dagger that cut at the roasted meat on the plate in front of her before sending pieces into her mouth with the dagger’s tip. There were only a few lines of words on the letter, yet Li stared at it for close to twenty minutes. Across from her, Li Gaolei sat with his legs crossed, his spacious back leaning against the chair’s support, his eyes currently closed in rest. His face was quite a bit thinner, his skin also a bit more tanned, but the wide and thick body wrapped under the leather jacket gave one a sense of security. Compared to his past self a year ago, he seemed to have gone through quite a bit, to the extent where there was even a bit of white hair. However, he was just as imposing, as if there wasn’t much that could move him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWith a\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003epa\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;sound, Li finally ended the long letter reading process, throwing the letter at Li Gaolei. Li Gaolei accepted the letter, opened his eyes to give it a look, and after scanning it two times, already read the contents. In reality, the paper only had three or four sentences in total, so no matter how one looked at it, it wouldn’t take more than half a minute to read through it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Fuck! What is this?! Left without saying anything again!” Li cursed angrily a few times, and then forcefully stabbed at the roasted meat with her dagger. However, contrary to what she expected, the dagger didn’t stab anything, instead striking on the steel military meal plate, releasing a\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eding\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;sound. The roasted meat in the plate had long been finished, and Li’s strike was unexpectedly fierce, the dagger directly stabbing through the steel meal plate.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLi breathed heavily a few times, and then under Li Gaolei’s calm gaze, finally said with some difficulty, “Alright, at least he left a letter for me this time. But it’s just a few lines, and then he left without even saying anything to us!

Miss Madeline possesses inconceivable combat strength, and the Cirvanas leader brought back this time possesses similarly astonishing potential. The two of them will be able to help leader, while me and you are only normal people. If we follow leader, we will likely only become leader’s burden.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“But!...” Li scratched at her hair in a distressed manner, almost tearing her hair off. She knew that what Li Gaolei said was correct, but it was hard for her to accept Su’s action of leaving her behind, disappearing off into who knew where. However, she couldn’t find any reason to retort, and as such, her anger was forced to remain pent-up in her chest.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Also, it isn’t like leader didn’t contact us at all. The letter clearly states that Kelan City, Midnight City, and Steel Gate were all left in the hands of the two of us. My understanding is that before leader returns, we have to properly manage this territory in his place. In reality, with our current abilities, holding onto such a large amount of territory is extremely difficult. This is definitely not an easy task.” Li Gaolei spoke in a calm and even-tempered manner.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Take care of it in his place?

We’re rich!” Li said through clenched teeth. She grabbed the letter from Li Gaolei’s hands and then tore it into pieces with a few movements. She then grabbed at the bottle of alcohol next to her, directly smashed apart the bottleneck, and with a few gulps, emptied a large half of the strong alcohol into her stomach. She then smashed the bottle of alcohol heavily on the ground!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLi was quite good at drinking, but she drank too much too fast, so her face immediately flushed with a layer of redness. A thick alcohol smell began to emanate from her fine skin. Li suddenly smiled, laughing while saying, “Three cities!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHaha,\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;you men, all of you think you know what I want!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLi suddenly removed her jacket, stared directly at Li Gaolei, and then while pausing between each word, said, “Do you want women?
