There were two men in the governor,—the courteous gentleman, and the implacable soldier.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Canolles returned to take supper with Nanon; but the supper was put ahead two hours, as he had determined not to leave the ramparts from dusk till dawn. He found Nanon running through a pile of letters.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You can defend the place with confidence, dear Canolles,\" said she, \"for it won\u0027t be long before you are re-enforced.

Have you thought about it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes,\" replied Nanon, smiling back at him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very good! have your boxes ready. A boatman will be waiting at a certain spot; if you have to take to the water, four of my people who are good swimmers will be at hand, with orders not to leave you, and they will take you ashore.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"All precautions are useless, Canolles; if you are killed I shall need nothing.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Supper was announced. Ten times, while they sat at table, Canolles rose and went to the window, which looked upon the river, and before the end of the repast he left the table altogether; night was beginning to fall.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nanon would have followed him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Nanon,\" said he, \"go to your room, and give me your word that you will not leave it. If I knew that you were outside, exposed to the slightest danger, I would not answer for myself. Nanon, my honor is at stake; do not trifle with my honor.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nanon offered Canolles her carmine lips, more brilliant in hue from the pallor of her cheeks, and went to her room, saying:—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I obey you, Canolles; I choose that enemies and friends alike should know the man I love; go!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Canolles left the room. He could not withhold his admiration from this strong nature, so quick to comply with his wishes, so responsive to his will. He had hardly reached his post ere the night came down, threatening and awe-inspiring, as it always is when it conceals in its dark depths a bloody secret.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Canolles took up his position at the end of the esplanade, which overlooked the course of the stream and both its banks. There was no moon; a veil of dark clouds overhung the earth. There was no danger of being seen, but it was almost impossible to see.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e About midnight, however, it seemed to him that he could distinguish dark masses moving upon the left bank, and gigantic shapes gliding along the surface of the stream. But there was no other noise than the moaning of the night wind among the branches.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The masses ceased to move, the shapes became stationary at some distance. Canolles thought that he must have been mistaken, but he redoubled his watchfulness; his eager eyes pierced the darkness, his ear was awake to the slightest sound.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The clock on the fortress struck three, and the slow, mournful reverberation died away in the darkness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Canolles was beginning to think that the warning he had received was a hoax, and he was on the point of retiring, when Lieutenant de Vibrac, who stood beside him, suddenly placed one hand upon his shoulder and pointed with the other toward the river.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, yes,\" said Canolles, \"there they are; we have no time to lose. Go and wake the men who are off duty, and station them behind the wall. You told them, didn\u0027t you, that I would kill the first man who fired?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, tell them again.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e By the first streaks of dawn long boats laden with men, who were laughing and talking in low tones, could be seen approaching the island, and there was a very pronounced eminence on the bank, which did not exist the night before. It was a battery of six guns which Monsieur de La Rochefoucauld had set up during the night, and the men in the boats had delayed their arrival because the battery was not ready to begin operations.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Canolles asked if the weapons were loaded, and upon being answered in the affirmative, bade the troops reserve their fire.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The boats came nearer and nearer, and there was soon light enough for Canolles to distinguish the cross-belts and peculiar hats worn by the Navailles regiment, to which, as we know, he formerly belonged. In the prow of one of the foremost boats was Baron de Ravailly, who had succeeded him in command of his company, and at the stern the lieutenant, who was his foster brother, a great favorite among his comrades because of his joyous nature, and his inexhaustible store of jokes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You will see,\" said he, \"that they won\u0027t stir, and Monsieur de La Rochefoucauld will have to wake them up with his cannon. Peste! how they sleep at Saint-Georges; I\u0027ll surely come here when I\u0027m ill.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Dear old Canolles plays his r?le of governor like a paterfamilias,\" said Ravailly; \"he\u0027s afraid his men will take cold if he makes them mount guard at night.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Upon my soul,\" said another, \"there\u0027s not a sentinel to be seen!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Holà!\" cried the lieutenant, stepping ashore, \"wake up, up there, and lend us a hand to come up.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Shouts of laughter arose along the whole line at this last pleasantry, and while three or four boats pulled toward the harbor, the rest of the force disembarked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I see how it is,\" said Ravailly; \"Canolles prefers to have it appear that he was taken by surprise in order not to get into trouble at court. Let us return him courtesy for courtesy, messieurs, and kill no one. Once in the fort, mercy for all, except for the women, who may not ask it, sarpejeu! Don\u0027t forget that this is a war between friends, boys; I \u002711 run through the first man who unsheathes his sword.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The merriment broke out afresh at this command, which was given with true French gayety, and the soldiers joined in with the officers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ah! my friends,\" said the lieutenant, \"it does one good to laugh, but we mustn\u0027t let it interfere with what we have to do. Ladders and grappling-hooks!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The soldiers thereupon drew forth long ladders from the boats, and advanced toward the wall.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At that, Canolles rose with his cane in his hand, and his hat on his head, like a man who was taking the fresh morning air for pleasure, and approached the parapet, which reached only to his waist.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was light enough for him to be recognized.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ah! good-morning, Navailles,\" he said to the regiment; \"good-morning, Ravailly; good-morning, Remonenq.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Look, it\u0027s Canolles!\" exclaimed the young officers; \"are you awake at last, baron?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why, yes! what would you have? we live like the King of Yvetot here,—early to bed, and late to rise; but what the devil are you doing at this time of night?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Pardieu!\" said Ravailly, \"I should think that you might see. We are here to besiege you, that\u0027s all.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, why are you here to besiege me?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To take your old fort.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Canolles began to laugh.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Come,\" said Ravailly, \"you surrender, don\u0027t you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But I must know first to whom I am surrendering. How happens it that Navailles is serving against the king?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Faith, my dear fellow, because we have turned rebels. On thinking it over we concluded that Mazarin was a downright rascal, unworthy to be served by gallant gentlemen; so we went over to the princes. And you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My dear fellow, I am an enthusiastic épernonist.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Pshaw! leave your people there and come with us.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Impossible—Ho! hands off the drawbridge chains down there! You know that those things are to be looked at from a distance, and it brings bad luck to touch them. Ravailly, bid them not touch the chains, or I\u0027ll fire on them,\" continued Canolles, frowning; \"and I warn you, Ravailly, that I have some excellent marksmen.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Bah! you are joking!\" rejoined the captain. \"Let yourself be taken; you are not in force.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am not joking. Down with the ladders! Ravailly, beware, I beg you, for it\u0027s the king\u0027s house you are besieging!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Saint-Georges the king\u0027s house!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Pardieu! look up and you will see the flag on the crown of the embankment. Come, push your boats off into the water, and put the ladders aboard, or I fire. If you want to talk, come alone or with Remonenq, and we will breakfast together, and talk as we eat. I have an excellent cook at ?le Saint-Georges.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ravailly began to laugh, and encouraged his men with a glance. Meanwhile another company was preparing to land.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Canolles saw that the decisive moment had arrived; and, assuming the firm attitude and serious demeanor befitting a man burdened with so heavy a responsibility as his, he cried:—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Halt there, Ravailly! A truce to jesting, Remonenq! not another word or step, or I fire, as truly as the king\u0027s flag is above, and as your arms are raised against the lilies of France.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Suiting the action to the threat, he overturned with his strong arm the first ladder that showed its head over the stones of the rampart.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Five or six men, more eager than their fellows, were already on the ladder, and were overturned with it. They fell, and a great shout of laughter arose from besiegers and besieged alike; one would have said they were schoolboys at play.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At that moment a signal was given to indicate that the besiegers had passed the chains drawn across the mouth of the harbor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ravailly and Remonenq at once seized a ladder and prepared to go down into the moat, shouting:—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This way, Navailles! Escalade! escalade! up! up!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My poor Ravailly,\" cried Canolles, \"I beseech you to stop where you are.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But at the same instant the shore battery, which had kept silent hitherto, flashed and roared, and a cannon-ball ploughed up the dirt all around Canolles.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Go to!\" said Canolles, extending his cane, \"if you will have it so! Fire, my lads, fire all along the line!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thereupon, although not a man could be seen, a row of muskets appeared, pointing down at the parapet, a girdle of flame enveloped the crown of the wall, while the detonation of two huge pieces of artillery answered Monsieur de La Rochefoucauld\u0027s battery.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Half a score of men fell; but their fall, instead of discouraging their comrades, inspired them with fresh ardor. The shore battery replied to the battery on the rampart; a cannon-ball struck down the royal standard, and another killed one of Canolles\u0027 lieutenants, named D\u0027Elboin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Canolles looked around and saw that his men had reloaded their weapons.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Fire!\" he cried, and the order was executed as promptly as before.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ten minutes later not a single pane of glass was left on the island. The stones trembled and burst in pieces; the cannon-balls knocked holes in the walls, and were flattened on the great flags; a dense smoke overhung the fort, and the air was filled with shrieks and threats and groans.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Canolles saw that Monsieur de La Rochefoucauld\u0027s artillery was doing the greatest amount of damage. \"Vibrac,\" said he, \"do you look out for Ravailly, and see that he doesn\u0027t gain an inch of ground in my absence. I am going to our battery.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He ran to the two pieces which were returning Monsieur de La Rochefoucauld\u0027s fire, and himself attended to loading and sighting them; in an instant three of the six guns on shore were dismounted, and fifty men were stretched on the ground. The others, who were not anticipating such a resistance, began to scatter and fly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Monsieur de La Rochefoucauld, trying to rally them, was struck by a fragment of stone, which knocked his sword out of his hands.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Canolles, content with this result, left the captain of the battery to do the rest, and ran back to repel the assault, which was continued by the Navailles regiment, supported by Espagnet\u0027s men.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Vibrac had maintained his ground, but had received a bullet in his shoulder.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Canolles, by his mere presence, redoubled the courage of his troops, who welcomed him with joyful shouts.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Pray pardon me,\" he cried to Ravailly, \"for leaving you for a moment, my dear friend; I did it, as you may see, to dismount Monsieur de La Rochefoucauld\u0027s guns; but be of good cheer, here I am again.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As the captain, who was too excited to reply to the jest,—indeed, it may be that he failed to hear it amid the terrific uproar of artillery and musketry,—led his men to the assault for the third time, Canolles drew a pistol from his belt, and taking aim at his former comrade, now his enemy, fired.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The ball was guided by a firm hand and sure eye; it broke Ravailly\u0027s arm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thanks, Canolles!\" he cried, for he saw who fired the shot. \"Thanks, I will pay you for that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Notwithstanding his force of will, the young captain was forced to halt, and his sword fell from his hands. Remonenq ran to him and caught him in his arms.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Will you come into the fort and have your wound dressed, Ravailly?\" cried Canolles. \"I have a surgeon who\u0027s as skilful in his line as my cook in his.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No; I return to Bordeaux. But expect me again at any moment, for I will come, I promise you. The next time, however, I will select my own hour.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Retreat! retreat!\" cried Remonenq. \"They are running over yonder. Au revoir, Canolles; you have the first game.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Remonenq spoke the truth; the artillery had done tremendous execution among the forces on shore, which had lost a hundred men or more. The naval contingent had fared little better. The greatest loss was sustained by the Navailles regiment, which, in order to uphold the honor of the uniform, had insisted upon marching ahead of D\u0027Espagnet\u0027s citizen soldiers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Canolles raised his pistol.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Cease firing!\" said he; \"we will let them retreat unmolested; we have no ammunition to waste.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Indeed, it would have been a waste of powder to continue the fire. The assailants retired in hot haste, taking their wounded with them, but leaving the dead behind.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Canolles mustered his men and found that he had four killed and sixteen wounded. Personally he had not received a scratch.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Dame!\" he exclaimed, as he was receiving Nanon\u0027s joyful caresses ten minutes later, \"they were not slow, my dear, to make me earn my governor\u0027s commission. What absurd butchery! I have killed a hundred and fifty men at least, and broken the arm of one of my best friends, to prevent his being killed outright.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes,\" said Nanon, \"but you are safe and sound, aren\u0027t you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank God! surely you brought me luck, Nanon. But look out for the second bout! The Bordelais are obstinate; and, more than that, Ravailly and Remonenq promised to come again.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, well,\" said Nanon, \"the same man will be in command at Saint-Georges, with the same troops to sustain him. Let them come, and the second time they will have a warmer reception than before, for between now and then you will have time to strengthen your defences, won\u0027t you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My dear,\" said Canolles, confidentially, \"one doesn\u0027t get to know a place all at once. Mine is not impregnable, I have discovered that already; and if my name were La Rochefoucauld, I would have ?le Saint-Georges to-morrow morning. By the way, D\u0027Elboin will not breakfast with us.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why not?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Because he was cut in two by a cannon-ball.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1647/48666.html","bookId":1205,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 10:56:02 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 10:56:02 AM"}
