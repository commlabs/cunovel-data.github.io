I’m not a follower. Not a joiner. I’m not even on Facebook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo whenever Herr Silverman brings up symbols, I can watch the others squirm and defend without feeling like a damn hypocrite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I’ve transcended my age, so to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy classmates are all repressed monkeys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my funeral suit, on the train, pretending to be a workaday Tom, I always pick out a target—the saddest-looking person I can find—and then I’ll get off at whatever stop the target does and follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNinety-nine percent of the time the target’s so comatose the target doesn’t even notice me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll trail the target, hanging five or so feet behind, and the target will always walk really quickly because the target is forever late and in a rush to get to a job the target inevitably hates, which I just don’t get.19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole time I pretend I have mental telepathy. And with my mind only, I’ll say—or think?—to the target, “Don’t do it. Don’t go to that job you hate. Do something you love today. Ride a roller coaster. Swim in the ocean naked. Go to the airport and get on the next flight to anywhere just for the fun of it. Maybe stop a spinning globe with your finger and then plan a trip to that very spot; even if it’s in the middle of the ocean you can go by boat. Eat some type of ethnic food you’ve never even heard of. Stop a stranger and ask her to explain her greatest fears and her secret hopes and aspirations in detail and then tell her you care because she is a human being. Sit down on the sidewalk and make pictures with colorful chalk. Close your eyes and try to see the world with your nose—allow smells to be your vision. Catch up on your sleep. Call an old friend you haven’t seen in years. Roll up your pant legs and walk into the sea. See a foreign film. Feed squirrels. Do anything! Something! Because you start a revolution one decision at a time, with each breath you take. Just don’t go back to that miserable place you go every day. Show me it’s possible to be an adult and also be happy. Please. This is a free country. You don’t have to keep doing this if you don’t want to. You can do anything you want. Be anyone you want. That’s what they tell us at school, but if you keep getting on that train and going to the place you hate I’m going to start thinking the people at school are liars like the Nazis who told the Jews they were just being relocated to work factories. Don’t do that to us. Tell us the truth. If adulthood is working some death-camp job you hate for the rest of your life, divorcing your secretly criminal husband, being disappointed in your son, being stressed and miserable, and dating a poser20 and pretending he’s a hero when he’s really a lousy person and anyone can tell that just by shaking his slimy hand21—if it doesn’t get any better, I need to know right now. Just tell me. Spare me from some awful fucking fate. Please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll do the mental telepathy bit for about ten minutes or so as the target climbs out of the subway stop and navigates skyscraper shadows and finally disappears inside a building that usually has a security guard to keep crazy people like me out.22\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo then I just go to the nearest park, sit with the pigeons, and stare at clouds until my workday is over and it’s time to ride home with all the other weary workaday Toms and Jennys, who look even more miserable on the p.m. return trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rides home always deepen my depression, because these people are free—off work, headed back to families they chose and made themselves—and yet they still don’t look happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI always wonder if that’s what Linda looks like riding home from New York City in a car—so utterly miserable, zombie-faced, cheated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes she look like the mother of a monster?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve taken dozens of practice-adulthood days, followed so many suits, but only once did anyone notice me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was this beautiful woman wearing huge 1970s sunglasses on the train, even though most of the ride is underground. I could see her mascara running down her cheek, but she was really beautiful otherwise. Like, I was sort of attracted to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong, bright blond hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed lipstick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack stockings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray pinstriped skirt suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou could tell that she was an authority figure just by the way she sat and dared anyone to say anything about the runny mascara. The vibe she sent out was menacing and it definitely said, “Don’t fuck with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless, on that day, this woman was by far the most miserable person on the train. You could tell she was upset, but it also looked like she’d rip your face off if you said anything to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the other adults pretended not to notice, which seemed cowardly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she was the obvious target for the day, I got off at her stop and followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember the sound of her high heels clicking on the concrete like cap guns firing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked up the escalator; I did too, trying hard to keep up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we cleared the turnstile I started the mental telepathy, saying (or thinking?), “Don’t do it. Don’t go to that job you hate. Go skydiving. Buy a star on the Internet. Adopt a cat.” And I continued with my routine for a city block or so. She turned into a back alley, and when we were halfway down it, she spun around tornadolike and pointed a can of mace at my nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are you and why are you following me?” she said. “I will destroy your day. This is top-grade stuff too. Illegal in the United States. I squeeze this trigger and you won’t be able to see for months. You might go blind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t know what to say, so I put my hands up in the air, like I’d seen criminals do in the movies whenever they want to surrender, when some tough Bogart-type guy points a gun and says, “Reach for the sky.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt surprised her, and she took a step back, but she didn’t spray me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How old are you?” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, “I’m seventeen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s your name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leonard Peacock.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s a fake name if I ever heard one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, “I can show you my school ID.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, “Let’s see it, but real slow. If you try anything funny, I’ll shoot you in the cornea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lowered my hands super slo-mo and said, “It’s in my pocket. May I reach into my jacket?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, so I produced my school ID.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took it, glanced at my name, and said, “Well, I’ll be damned. You really are Leonard Peacock. What a stupid name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, “Why are you crying?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw her trigger finger twitch and I thought I was about to get maced, but instead she put my school ID into her purse and said, “Why are you following me, really? Did someone pay you? What do they want?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. It’s nothing like that at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved the mace a few inches closer to my face, pointed at my left eye, and said, “Don’t fuck with me, Leonard Peacock. Did Brian put you up to this? Huh? Tell me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hands up again and said, “I don’t know any Brian. I’m just a dumb kid. I dress up like an adult and skip school every once in a while to see what being an adult is like. Okay? I just want to know if growing up’s worth it. That’s all. And so I follow the most miserable-looking adult to work, because I just know that’s going to be me someday—the most miserable adult on the train. I need to know if I can take it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, “Take what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, “Being a miserable adult.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lowered her mace. “Really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, “You’re absolutely crazy, aren’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But not dangerous, right? You’re a lamb.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head no, because I wasn’t a threat back then. And then I nodded, because I wasn’t a wolf or a lion or anything predatory at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, “Okay. Do you drink coffee?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eELEVEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took me to this coffee place close to the alley where she stole my school ID. It was mostly old people eating bagels and slurping joe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started talking about how stressed out she was and how there was this guy at her work named Brian whom she had screwed once and he was now using that against her because they were up for the same promotion. Her mother was dying in some hospice center in New Jersey, which was where she had spent the previous night. She had really wanted to stay with her mother because her mom was close to the end of her life, but this woman knew that—while no one would tell her she couldn’t be there for her mother’s passing—Brian would use her absence from work as a way to beat her out for the position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr at least that’s what I understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was rambling and slurring words like she was drunk and she kept waving her hands and she wouldn’t take off her sunglasses even inside the coffee shop. She talked for an hour or so, and I was beginning to think she was a great big liar because if she left her dying mom to get ahead at work, why the hell would she waste her time with me at the coffee shop? Wouldn’t Brian use missing work—for any reason at all—against her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was thinking about all of this when she said, “So what have you learned following around adults? Spying on us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, “I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t lie to me. You owe me an explanation, Leonard Peacock.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so I swallowed and said, “I’m not finished researching, which is why I followed you today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What have you learned today from me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Truthfully?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I said, “You seem really unhappy. And most of the people I follow are the same. It seems like they don’t like their jobs and yet they also don’t like going home either. It’s like they hate every aspect of their lives.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed and said, “You need to follow people on the train to figure that out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I said, “I was hoping that I had it wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she said, “Don’t all the kids in your high school seem miserable too? I hated high school. HATED it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I said, “Yeah, most of them do seem miserable. Although they try to fake it the best they can. Kids fake it better than adults, right? My theory is that we lose the ability to be happy as we age.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. “So if you’ve got it all figured out, why follow adults like me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like I said before, I was hoping that I’m wrong, that life gets better for some people when they get older, and even the most miserable people—such as you and me—might be able to enjoy at least some aspect of adulthood. Like those ads where gay guys talk about being picked on in high school but then they grew up and discovered that adult life is like heaven. They say it gets better. I want to believe that happiness might at least be possible later on in life for people prone to sadness.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swatted my words out of the air with her hand and said, “All ads are lies. Life doesn’t get better at all. Adulthood is hell. And everything I told you about myself was a lie too. I made everything up just to see who you were because I thought they paid you to be a spy. But the joke’s on me because you really are just a crazy, sad, underfed high school student who follows random people. That’s sick. Perverted. I’m keeping your ID and if I ever see you again I’m pressing charges and getting a restraining order.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forgive-me-leonard-peacock/page-5.html","bookId":2705,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:33 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:33 AM"}
