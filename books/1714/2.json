{"id":67061,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s midnight now. The house is dark. I am not sure how this will turn out. The kids are all desperately sick, throwing up. I can hear my son and daughter retching in separate bathrooms. I went in to check on them a few minutes ago, to see what was coming up. I\u0027m worried about the baby, but I had to make her sick, too. It was her only hope. I think I\u0027m okay, at least for the moment. But of course the odds aren\u0027t good: most of the people involved in this business are already dead. And there are so many things I can\u0027t know for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe facility is destroyed, but I don\u0027t know if we did it in time. I\u0027m waiting for Mae. She went to the lab in Palo Alto twelve hours ago. I hope she succeeded. I hope she made them understand how desperate the situation is. I expected to hear from the lab but so far there has been no word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have ringing in my ears, which is a bad sign. And I feel a vibrating in my chest and abdomen. The baby is spitting up, not really vomiting. I am feeling dizzy. I hope I don\u0027t lose consciousness. The kids need me, especially the little one. They\u0027re frightened. I don\u0027t blame them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting here in the dark, it\u0027s hard to believe that a week ago my biggest problem was finding a job. It seems almost laughable now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, things never turn out the way you think they will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDAY 1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e10:04 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings never turn out the way you think they will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never intended to become a househusband. Stay-at-home husband. Full-time dad, whatever you want to call it-there is no good term for it. But that\u0027s what I had become in the last six months. Now I was in Crate \u0026amp; Barrel in downtown San Jose, picking up some extra glasses, and while I was there I noticed they had a good selection of placemats. We needed more placemats; the woven oval ones that Julia had bought a year ago were getting pretty worn, and the weave was crusted with baby food. The trouble was, they were woven, so you couldn\u0027t wash them. So I stopped at the display to see if they had any placemats that might be good, and I found some pale blue ones that were nice, and I got some white napkins. And then some yellow placemats caught my eye, because they looked really bright and appealing, so I got those, too. They didn\u0027t have six on the shelf, and I thought we\u0027d better have six, so I asked the salesgirl to look in the back and see if they had more. While she was gone I put the placemat on the table, and put a white dish on it, and then I put a yellow napkin next to it. The setting looked very cheerful, and I began to think maybe I should get eight instead of six. That was when my cell phone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Julia. \"Hi, hon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Julia. How\u0027s it going?\" I said. I could hear machinery in the background, a steady chugging. Probably the vacuum pump for the electron microscope. They had several scanning electron microscopes at her laboratory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"What\u0027re you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buying placemats, actually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crate and Barrel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. \"You the only guy there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, well, that\u0027s good,\" she said. I could tell Julia was completely uninterested in this conversation. Something else was on her mind. \"Listen, I wanted to tell you, Jack, I\u0027m really sorry, but it\u0027s going to be a late night again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh ...\" The salesgirl came back, carrying more yellow mats. Still holding the phone to my ear, I beckoned her over. I held up three fingers, and she put down three more mats. To Julia, I said, \"Is everything all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, it\u0027s just crazy like normal. We\u0027re broadcasting a demo by satellite today to the VCs in Asia and Europe, and we\u0027re having trouble with the satellite hookup at this end because the video truck they sent-oh, you don\u0027t want to know ... anyway, we\u0027re going to be delayed two hours, hon. Maybe more. I won\u0027t get back until eight at the earliest. Can you feed the kids and put them to bed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem,\" I said. And it wasn\u0027t. I was used to it. Lately, Julia had been working very long hours. Most nights she didn\u0027t get home until the children were asleep. Xymos Technology, the company she worked for, was trying to raise another round of venture capital-twenty million dollars-and there was a lot of pressure. Especially since Xymos was developing technology in what the company called \"molecular manufacturing,\" but which most people called nanotechnology. Nano wasn\u0027t popular with the VCs-the venture capitalists-these days. Too many VCs had been burned in the last ten years with products that were supposedly just around the corner, but then never made it out of the lab. The VCs considered nano to be all promise, no products.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that Julia needed to be told that; she\u0027d worked for two VC firms herself. Originally trained as a child psychologist, she ended up as someone who specialized in \"technology incubation,\" helping fledgling technology companies get started. (She used to joke she was still doing child psychology.) Eventually, she\u0027d stopped advising firms and joined one of them full-time. She was now a vice president at Xymos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia said Xymos had made several breakthroughs, and was far ahead of others in the field. She said they were just days away from a prototype commercial product. But I took what she said with a grain of salt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, Jack, I want to warn you,\" she said, in a guilty voice, \"that Eric is going to be upset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well ... I told him I would come to the game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Julia, why? We talked about making promises like this. There\u0027s no way you can make that game. It\u0027s at three o\u0027clock. Why\u0027d you tell him you would?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought I could make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. It was, I told myself, a sign of her caring. \"Okay. Don\u0027t worry, honey. I\u0027ll handle it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. Oh, and Jack? The placemats? Whatever you do, just don\u0027t get yellow, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made spaghetti for dinner because there was never an argument about spaghetti. By eight o\u0027clock, the two little ones were asleep, and Nicole was finishing her homework. She was twelve, and had to be in bed by ten o\u0027clock, though she didn\u0027t like any of her friends to know that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe littlest one, Amanda, was just nine months. She was starting to crawl everywhere, and to stand up holding on to things. Eric was eight; he was a soccer kid, and liked to play all the time, when he wasn\u0027t dressing up as a knight and chasing his older sister around the house with his plastic sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicole was in a modest phase of her life; Eric liked nothing better than to grab her bra and go running around the house, shouting, \"Nicky wears a bra-a! Nicky wears a bra-a!\" while Nicole, too dignified to pursue him, gritted her teeth and yelled, \"Dad? He\u0027s doing it again! Dad!\" And I would have to go chase Eric and tell him not to touch his sister\u0027s things. This was what my life had become. At first, after I lost the job at MediaTronics, it was interesting to deal with sibling rivalry. And often, it seemed, not that different from what my job had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt MediaTronics I had run a program division, riding herd over a group of talented young computer programmers. At forty, I was too old to work as a programmer myself anymore; writing code is a young person\u0027s job. So I managed the team, and it was a full-time job; like most Silicon Valley programmers, my team seemed to live in a perpetual crisis of crashed Porsches, infidelities, bad love affairs, parental hassles, and drug reactions, all superimposed on a forced-march work schedule with all-night marathons fueled by cases of Diet Coke and Sun chips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the work was exciting, in a cutting-edge field. We wrote what are called distributed parallel processing or agent-based programs. These programs model biological processes by creating virtual agents inside the computer and then letting the agents interact to solve real-world problems. It sounds strange, but it works fine. For example, one of our programs imitated ant foraging-how ants find the shortest path to food-to route traffic through a big telephone network. Other programs mimicked the behavior of termites, swarming bees, and stalking lions. It was fun, and I would probably still be there if I hadn\u0027t taken on some additional responsibilities. In my last few months there, I\u0027d been put in charge of security, replacing an outside tech consultant who\u0027d had the job for two years but had failed to detect the theft of company source code, until it turned up in a program being marketed out of Taiwan. Actually, it was my division\u0027s source code-software for distributed processing. That was the code that had been stolen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe knew it was the same code, because the Easter eggs hadn\u0027t been touched. Programmers always insert Easter eggs into their code, little nuggets that don\u0027t serve any useful purpose and are just put there for fun. The Taiwanese company hadn\u0027t changed any of them; they used our code wholesale. So the keystrokes Alt-Shift-M-9 would open up a window giving the date of one of our programmers\u0027 marriage. Clear theft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course we sued, but Don Gross, the head of the company, wanted to make sure it didn\u0027t happen again. So he put me in charge of security, and I was angry enough about the theft to take the job. It was only part-time; I still ran the division. The first thing I did as security officer was to monitor workstation use. It was pretty straightforward; these days, eighty percent of companies monitor what their workers do at terminals. They do it by video, or they do it by recording keystrokes, or by scanning email for certain keywords ... all sorts of procedures out there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon Gross was a tough guy, an ex-Marine who had never lost his military manner. When I told him about the new system, he said, \"But you\u0027re not monitoring my terminal, right?\" Of course not, I said. In fact, I\u0027d set up the programs to monitor every computer in the company, his included. And that was how I discovered, two weeks later, that Don was having an affair with a girl in accounting, and had authorized her to have a company car. I went to him and said that based on emails relating to Jean in accounting, it appeared that someone unknown was having an affair with her, and that she might be getting perks she wasn\u0027t entitled to. I said I didn\u0027t know who the person was, but if they kept using email, I\u0027d soon find out. I figured Don would take the hint, and he did. But now he just sent incriminating email from his home, never realizing that everything went through the company server and I was getting it all. That\u0027s how I learned he was \"discounting\" software to foreign distributors, and taking large \"consultant fees\" into an account in the Cayman Islands. This was clearly illegal, and I couldn\u0027t overlook it. I consulted my attorney, Gary Marder, who advised me to quit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quit?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who cares why? You got a better offer elsewhere. You\u0027ve got some health problems. Or some family issues. Trouble at home. Just get out of there. Quit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute,\" I said. \"You think I should quit because he\u0027s breaking the law? Is that your advice to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Gary said. \"As your attorney, my advice is that if you are aware of any illegal activity you have a duty to report it. But as your friend, my advice is to keep your mouth shut and get out of there fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seems kind of cowardly. I think I have to notify the investors.\" Gary sighed. He put his hand on my shoulder. \"Jack,\" he said, \"the investors can look out for themselves. You get the fuck out of there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t think that was right. I had been annoyed when my code had been stolen. Now I found myself wondering if it actually had been stolen. Maybe it had been sold. We were a privately held company, and I told one of the board members.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt turned out he was in on it. I was fired the next day for gross negligence and misconduct. Litigation was threatened; I had to sign a raft of NDAs in order to get my severance package. My attorney handled the paperwork for me, sighing with every new document.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end, we went outside into the milky sunshine. I said, \"Well, at least that\u0027s over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and looked at me. \"Why do you say that?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of course it wasn\u0027t over. In some mysterious way, I had become a marked man. My qualifications were excellent and I worked in a hot field. But when I went on job interviews I could tell they weren\u0027t interested. Worse, they were uncomfortable. Silicon Valley covers a big area, but it\u0027s a small place. Word gets out. Eventually I found myself talking to an interviewer I knew slightly, Ted Landow. I\u0027d coached his kid in Little League baseball the year before. When the interview was over, I said to him, \"What have you heard about me?\" He shook his head. \"Nothing, Jack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Ted, I\u0027ve been on ten interviews in ten days. Tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing to tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shuffled through his papers, looking down at them, not at me. He sighed. \"Jack Forman. Troublemaker. Not cooperative. Belligerent. Hot-headed. Not a team player.\" He hesitated, then said, \"And supposedly you were involved in some kind of dealings. They won\u0027t say what, but some kind of shady dealings. You were on the take.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was on the take?\" I said. I felt a flood of anger, and started to say more, until I realized I was probably looking hotheaded and belligerent. So I shut up, and thanked him. As I was leaving, he said, \"Jack, do yourself a favor. Give it a while. Things change fast in the Valley. Your resume is strong and your skill set is outstanding. Wait until ...\" He shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A couple of months?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d say four. Maybe five.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow I knew he was right. After that, I stopped trying so hard. I began to hear rumors that MediaTronics was going belly up, and there might be indictments. I smelled vindication ahead, but in the meantime there was nothing to do but wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strangeness of not going to work in the morning slowly faded. Julia was working longer hours at her job, and the kids were demanding; if I was in the house they turned to me, instead of our housekeeper, Maria. I started taking them to school, picking them up, driving them to the doctor, the orthodontist, soccer practice. The first few dinners I cooked were disastrous, but I got better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd before I knew it, I was buying placemats and looking at table settings in Crate \u0026amp; Barrel. And it all seemed perfectly normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia got home around nine-thirty. I was watching the Giants game on TV, not really paying attention. She came in and kissed me on the back of my neck. She said, \"They all asleep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except Nicole. She\u0027s still doing homework.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeez, isn\u0027t it late for her to be up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, hon,\" I said. \"We agreed. This year she gets to stay up until ten, remember?\" Julia shrugged, as if she didn\u0027t remember. And maybe she didn\u0027t. We had undergone a sort of inversion of roles; she had always been more knowledgeable about the kids, but now I was. Sometimes Julia felt uncomfortable with that, experiencing it somehow as a loss of power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s the little one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her cold is better. Just sniffles. She\u0027s eating more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked with Julia to the bedrooms. She went into the baby\u0027s room, bent over the crib, and kissed the sleeping child tenderly. Watching her, I thought there was something about a mother\u0027s caring that a father could never match. Julia had some connection to the kids that I never would. Or at least a different connection. She listened to the baby\u0027s soft breathing, and said, \"Yes, she\u0027s better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she went into Eric\u0027s room, took the Game Boy off the bed covers, gave me a frown. I shrugged, faintly irritated; I knew Eric played with his Game Boy when he was supposed to be going to sleep, but I was busy getting the baby down at that time, and I overlooked it. I thought Julia should be more understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she went into Nicole\u0027s room. Nicole was on her laptop, but shut the lid when her mother walked in. \"Hi, Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re up late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Mom ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re supposed to be doing homework.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why aren\u0027t you in bed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want you spending all night talking to your friends on the computer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom ...\" she said, in a pained voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see them every day at school, that should be enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t look at your father. We already know he\u0027ll do whatever you want. I\u0027m talking to you, now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. \"I know, Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis kind of interaction was increasingly common between Nicole and Julia. I guess it was normal at this age, but I thought I\u0027d step in. Julia was tired, and when she was tired she got rigid and controlling. I put my arm around her shoulder and said, \"It\u0027s late for everybody. Want a cup of tea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack, don\u0027t interfere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not, I just-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you are. I\u0027m talking to Nicole and you\u0027re interfering, the way you always do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey, we all agreed she could stay up until ten, I don\u0027t know what this-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if she\u0027s finished her homework, she should go to bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That wasn\u0027t the deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want her spending all day and night on the computer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not, Julia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that point, Nicole burst into tears, and jumped to her feet crying, \"You always criticize me! I hate you!\" She ran into the bathroom and slammed the door. That woke the baby, who started to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia turned to me and said, \"If you would please just let me handle this myself, Jack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I said, \"You\u0027re right. I\u0027m sorry. You\u0027re right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth, that wasn\u0027t what I thought at all. More and more, I regarded this as my house, and my kids. She was barging into my house, late at night, when I\u0027d gotten everything quiet, the way I liked it, the way it should be. And she was raising a fuss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t think she was right at all. I thought she was wrong. And in the last few weeks I\u0027d noticed that incidents like this had become more frequent. At first, I thought Julia felt guilty about being away so much. Then I thought she was reasserting her authority, trying to regain control of a household that had fallen into my hands. Then I thought it was because she was tired, or under so much pressure at work. But lately I felt I was making excuses for her behavior. I started to have the feeling Julia had changed. She was different, somehow, tenser, tougher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe baby was howling. I picked her up from the crib, hugged her, cooed at her, and simultaneously stuck a finger down the back of the diaper to see if it was wet. It was. I put her down on her back on top of the dresser, and she howled again until I shook her favorite rattle, and put it in her hand. She was silent then, allowing me to change her without much kicking. \"I\u0027ll do that,\" Julia said, coming in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I woke her up, it\u0027s only right I do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really honey, it\u0027s fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia put her hand on my shoulder, kissed the back of my neck. \"I\u0027m sorry I\u0027m such a jerk. I\u0027m really tired. I don\u0027t know what came over me. Let me change the baby, I never get to see her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said. I stepped aside, and she moved in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Poopsie-doopsie,\" she said, chucking the baby under the chin. \"How\u0027s my little Winkie-dinkie?\" All this attention made the baby drop the rattle, and then she started to cry, and to twist away on the table. Julia didn\u0027t notice the missing rattle caused the crying; instead she made soothing sounds and struggled to put on the new diaper, but the baby\u0027s twisting and kicking made it hard. \"Amanda, stop it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"She does that now.\" And it was true, Amanda was in the stage where she actively resisted a diaper change. And she could kick pretty hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, she should stop. Stop!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe baby cried louder, tried to turn away. One of the adhesive tabs pulled off. The diaper slid down. Amanda was now rolling toward the edge of the dresser. Julia pulled her back roughly. Amanda never stopped kicking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God damn it, I said stop!\" Julia said, and smacked the baby on the leg. The baby just cried harder, kicked harder. \"Amanda! Stop it! Stop it!\" She slapped her again. \"Stop it! Stop it!\" For a moment I didn\u0027t react. I was stunned. I didn\u0027t know what to do. The baby\u0027s legs were bright red. Julia was still hitting her. \"Honey ...\" I said, leaning in, \"let\u0027s not-\" Julia exploded. \"Why do you always fucking interfere?\" she yelled, slamming her hand down on the dresser. \"What is your fucking problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she stomped off, leaving the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let out a long breath, and picked the baby up. Amanda howled inconsolably, as much in confusion as in pain. I figured I would need to give her a bottle to get her to sleep again. I stroked her back until she settled down a little. Then I got her diaper on, and brought her into the kitchen while I heated a bottle. The lights were low, just the fluorescents over the counter. Julia was sitting at the table, drinking beer out of a bottle, staring into space. \"When are you going to get a job?\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really? I don\u0027t think you\u0027re trying at all. When was your last interview?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last week,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grunted. \"I wish you\u0027d hurry up and get one,\" she said, \"because this is driving me crazy.\" I swallowed anger. \"I know. It\u0027s hard for everybody,\" I said. It was late at night, and I didn\u0027t want to argue anymore. But I was watching her out of the corner of my eye. At thirty-six, Julia was a strikingly pretty woman, petite, with dark hair and dark eyes, upturned nose, and the kind of personality that people called bubbly or sparkling. Unlike many tech executives, she was attractive and approachable. She made friends easily, and had a good sense of humor. Years back, when we first had Nicole, Julia would come home with hilarious accounts of the foibles of her VC partners. We used to sit at this same kitchen table and laugh until I felt physically sick, while little Nicole would tug at her arm and say, \"What\u0027s the funny, Mom? What\u0027s the funny?\" because she wanted to be in on the joke. Of course we could never explain it to her, but Julia always seemed to have a new \"Knock knock\" joke for Nicole, so she could join in the laughter, too. Julia had a real gift for seeing the humorous side of life. She was famous for her equanimity; she almost never lost her temper. Right now, of course, she was furious. Not even willing to look at me. Sitting in the dark at the round kitchen table, one leg crossed over the other, kicking impatiently while she stared into space. As I looked at her, I had the feeling that her appearance had changed, somehow. Of course she had lost weight recently, part of the strain of the job. A certain softness in her face was gone; her cheekbones protruded more; her chin seemed sharper. It made her look harder, but in a way more glamorous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer clothes were different, too. Julia was wearing a dark skirt and a white blouse, sort of standard business attire. But the skirt was tighter than usual. And her kicking foot made me notice she was wearing slingback high heels. What she used to call fuck-me shoes. The kind of shoes she would never wear to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I realized that everything about her was different-her manner, her appearance, her mood, everything-and in a flash of insight I knew why: my wife was having an affair. The water on the stove began to steam, and I pulled out the bottle, tested it on my forearm. It had gotten too hot, and I would have to wait a minute for it to cool. The baby started to cry, and I bounced her a little on my shoulder, while I walked her around the room. Julia never looked at me. She just kept swinging her foot, and staring into space. I had read somewhere that this was a syndrome. The husband\u0027s out of work, his masculine appeal declines, his wife no longer respects him, and she wanders. I had read that in Glamour or Redbook or one of those magazines around the house that I glanced through while waiting for the washing machine to finish its cycle, or the microwave to thaw the hamburger. But now I was flooded with confused feelings. Was it really true? Was I just tired, making up bad stories in my mind? After all, what difference did it make if she was wearing tighter skirts and different shoes? Fashions changed. People felt different on different days. And just because she was sometimes angry, did that really mean she was having an affair? Of course it didn\u0027t. I was probably just feeling inadequate, unattractive. These were probably my insecurities coming out. My thoughts went on in this vein for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for some reason, I couldn\u0027t talk myself out of it. I was sure it was true. I had lived with this woman for more than twelve years. I knew she was different, and I knew why. I could sense the presence of someone else, an outside person, some intruder in our relationship. I felt it with a conviction that surprised me. I felt it in my bones, like an ache. I had to turn away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe baby took the bottle, gurgling happily. In the darkened kitchen, she stared up at my face with that peculiar fixed stare that babies have. It was sort of soothing, watching her. After a while she closed her eyes, and then her mouth went slack. I put her on my shoulder and burped her as I carried her back into her bedroom. Most parents pat their babies too hard, trying to get a burp. It\u0027s better to just rub the flat of your hand up their back, and sometimes just along the spine with two fingers. She gave a soft belch, and relaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set her down in the crib, and I turned out the night-light. Now the only light in the room came from the aquarium, bubbling green-blue in the corner. A plastic diver trudged along the bottom, trailing bubbles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I turned to go, I saw Julia silhouetted in the doorway, dark hair backlit. She had been watching me. I couldn\u0027t read her expression. She stalked forward. I tensed. She put her arms around me and rested her head on my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please forgive me,\" she said. \"I\u0027m a real jerk. You\u0027re doing a wonderful job. I\u0027m just jealous, that\u0027s all.\" My shoulder was wet with her tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" I said, holding her. \"It\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited to see if my body relaxed, but it didn\u0027t. I was suspicious and alert. I had a bad feeling about her, and it wasn\u0027t going away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came out of the shower into the bedroom, toweling her short hair dry. I was sitting on the bed, trying to watch the rest of the game. It occurred to me that she never used to take showers at night. Julia always took a shower in the morning before work. Now, I realized, she often came home and went straight to the shower before coming out to say hello to the kids. My body was still tense. I flicked the TV off. I said, \"How was the demo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The demo. Didn\u0027t you have a demo today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" she said. \"Oh, yes. We did. It went fine, when we finally got it going. The VCs in Germany couldn\u0027t stay for all of it because of the time change, but-listen, do you want to see it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a dub of it. Want to see it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was surprised. I shrugged. \"Okay, sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d really like to know what you think, Jack.\" I detected a patronizing tone. My wife was including me in her work. Making me feel a part of her life. I watched as she opened her briefcase and took out a DVD. She stuck it in the player, and came back to sit with me on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were you demoing?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The new medical imaging technology,\" she said. \"It\u0027s really slick, if I say so myself.\" She snuggled up, tucking herself into my shoulder. All very cozy, just like old times. I still felt uneasy, but I put my arm around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By the way,\" I said, \"how come you take showers at night now, instead of in the morning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" she said. \"Do I? I guess I do. It just seems easier, honey. Mornings are so rushed, and I\u0027ve been getting those conference calls from Europe, they take so much time-okay, here we go,\" she said, pointing to the screen. I saw black-and-white scramble, and then the image resolved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tape showed Julia in a large laboratory that was fitted out like an operating room. A man lay on his back on the gurney, an IV in his arm, an anesthesiologist standing by. Above the table was a round flat metal plate about six feet in diameter, which could be raised and lowered, but was now raised. There were video monitors all around. And in the foreground, peering at a monitor, was Julia. There was a video technician by her side. \"This is terrible,\" she was saying, pointing to the monitor. \"What\u0027s all the interference?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We think it\u0027s the air purifiers. They\u0027re causing it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, this is unacceptable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want us to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to fix it,\" Julia said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we have to boost power, and you have-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care,\" she said. \"I can\u0027t show the VCs an image of this quality. They\u0027ve seen better pictures from Mars. Fix it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside me on the bed, Julia said, \"I didn\u0027t know they recorded all this. This is before the demo. You can fast forward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed the remote. The picture scrambled. I waited a few seconds, and played it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSame scene. Julia still in the foreground. Carol, her assistant, whispering to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, but then what do I tell him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell him no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he wants to get started.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand. But the transmission isn\u0027t for an hour. Tell him no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the bed, Julia said to me, \"Mad Dog was our experimental subject. He was very restless. Impatient to get started.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the screen, the assistant lowered her voice. \"I think he\u0027s nervous, Julia. I would be, too, with a couple of million of those things crawling around inside my body-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not a couple of million, and they\u0027re not crawling,\" Julia said. \"Anyway, they\u0027re his invention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t that an anesthesiologist over there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, just a cardiologist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, maybe the cardiologist can give him something for his nervousness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They already did. An injection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the bed beside me, Julia said, \"Fast forward, Jack.\" I did. The picture jumped ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw Julia standing at the monitor again, with the technician beside her. \"That\u0027s acceptable,\" onscreen Julia was saying, pointing to the image. \"Not great, but acceptable. Now, show me the STM.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The STM. The electron microscope. Show me the image from that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe technician looked confused. \"Uh ... Nobody told us about any electron microscope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For God\u0027s sake, read the damn storyboards!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe technician blinked. \"It\u0027s on the storyboards?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you look at the storyboards?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, I guess I must have missed it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no time now to be sorry. Fix it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to shout.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes I do! I have to shout, because I\u0027m surrounded by idiots!\" She waved her hands in the air. \"I\u0027m about to go online and talk to eleven billion dollars of venture capital in five countries and show them submicroscopic technology, except I don\u0027t have a microscope feed, so they can\u0027t see the technology!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the bed, Julia said, \"I kind of lost it with this guy. It was so frustrating. We had a clock counting down to the satellite time, which was booked and locked. We couldn\u0027t change it. We had to make the time, and this guy was a dimbus. But eventually we got it working. Fast forward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screen showed a static card, which read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Private Demonstration of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdvanced Medical Imaging\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXymos Technology\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMountain View, CA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorld Leader in Molecular Manufacturing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, on the screen, Julia appeared, standing in front of the gurney and the medical apparatus. She\u0027d brushed her hair and tucked in her blouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello to all of you,\" she said, smiling at the camera. \"I\u0027m Julia Forman of Xymos Technology, and we\u0027re about to demonstrate a revolutionary medical imaging procedure just developed here. Our subject, Peter Morris, is lying behind me on the table. In a few moments, we\u0027re going to look inside his heart and blood vessels with an ease and accuracy never before possible.\" She began walking around the table, talking as she went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unlike cardiac catheterization, our procedure is one hundred percent safe. And unlike catheterization, we can look everywhere in the body, at every sort of vessel, no matter how large or small. We\u0027ll see inside his aorta, the largest artery of the body. But we\u0027ll also look inside the alveoli of his lungs, and the tiny capillaries of his fingertips. We can do all this because the camera we put inside his vessels is smaller than a red blood cell. Quite a bit smaller, actually. \"Xymos microfabrication technology can now produce these miniaturized cameras, and produce them in quantity-cheaply, quickly. It would take a thousand of them just to make a dot the size of a pencil point. We can fabricate a kilogram of these cameras in an hour. \"I\u0027m sure you are all skeptical. We\u0027re well aware that nanotechnology has made promises it couldn\u0027t deliver. As you know, the problem has been that scientists could design molecular-scale devices, but they couldn\u0027t manufacture them. But Xymos has solved that problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt suddenly hit me, what she was saying. \"What?\" I said, sitting up in bed. \"Are you kidding?\" If it was true, it was an extraordinary development, a genuine technological breakthrough, and it meant-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true,\" Julia said quietly. \"We\u0027re manufacturing in Nevada.\" She smiled, enjoying my astonishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnscreen, Julia was saying, \"I have one of our Xymos cameras under the electron microscope, here\"-she pointed to the screen-\"so you can see it in comparison to the red blood cell alongside it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe image changed to black-and-white. I saw a fine probe push what looked like a tiny squid into position on a titanium field. It was a bullet-nosed lump with streaming filaments at the rear. It was a tenth of the size of the red blood cell, which in the vacuum of the scanning electron microscope was a wrinkled oval, like a gray raisin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our camera is one ten-billionth of an inch in length. As you see, it is shaped like a squid,\" Julia said. \"Imaging takes place in the nose. Microtubules in the tail provide stabilization, like the tail of a kite. But they can also lash actively, and provide locomotion. Jerry, if we can turn the camera to see the nose ... Okay, there. Thank you. Now, from the front, you see that indentation in the center? That is the miniature gallium arsenide photon detector, acting as a retina, and the surrounding banded area-sort of like a radial tire-is bioluminescent, and lights the area ahead. Within the nose itself you may be able to just make out a rather complex series of twisted molecules. That is our patented ATP cascade. You can think of it as a primitive brain, which controls the behavior of the camera-very limited behavior, true, but enough for our purposes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard a hiss of static, and a cough. The screen image opened a small window in the corner, and now showed Fritz Leidermeyer, in Germany. The investor shifted his enormous bulk. \"I\u0027m sorry, Ms. Forman. Tell me please where is the lens?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no lens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you have a camera with no lens?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll explain that as we go,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching, I said, \"It must be a camera obscura.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" she said, nodding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCamera obscura-Latin for \"dark room\"-was the oldest imaging device known. The Romans had found that if you made a small hole in the wall of a dark room, an upside-down image of the exterior appeared on the opposite wall. That was because light coming through any small aperture was focused, as if by a lens. It was the same principle as a kid\u0027s pinhole camera. It was why ever since Roman times, image-recording devices were called cameras. But in this case-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What makes the aperture?\" I said. \"Is there a pinhole?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you knew,\" she said. \"You\u0027re responsible for that part.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.
