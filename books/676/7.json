Over thirty! And some of you probably have doors at home too. Maybe more than one. All those doors. Think about it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, Mr, Kidswatter has certainly given us something to think about this morning,\" said Mrs, Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So remember,\" said Mr. Kidswatter. \"And please be careful! Always check to see if a door is open before going through it. And if it\u0027s not open, open it. If you can\u0027t open it yourself, ask someone to open it for you. This may not make a lot of sense to you now, but someday you\u0027ll thank me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls looked around the class. \"That\u0027s good advice,\" she said. \"I think most of you already knew it, but at least it\u0027s nice to know we have a principal who cares.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I hate doors!\" shouted Mr. Kidswatter. \"It\u0027s a dumb word. Door. Door. Door.

You know what word I mean-but don\u0027t say it! Instead, I have made up a new word for you: \u0027Goozack.\u0027 Open the goozack. Shut the goozack. Lock the goozack. Don\u0027t you think that\u0027s a better word? I do. From now on, that other word is a bad word. I have made my decision.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Everyone turned around and looked at the goozack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Suddenly it opened.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Todd entered. \"I\u0027m sorry I\u0027m late,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s okay,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I\u0027m just glad you\u0027re not sick or hurt.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My dad locked his keys in the car,\" Todd explained. \"We had to use a coat hanger to unlock the door.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Everyone gasped.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls made Todd write his name on the blackboard under the word DISCIPLINE.\n\u003cbr\u003e 39\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Twas the last day of school Before winter vacation,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And the children were having A small celebration.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1990/56925.html","bookId":676,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 2:24:18 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 2:24:18 PM"}
