To his surprise, she actually obeyed and swallowed back the sharp words. She reached out for Leo\u0027s coat. \"I\u0027ll take that,\" she said in a subdued tone. \"Thank you.\" Both avoided looking at each other. \"We\u0027ve just finished supper,\" Amelia muttered. \"The stew is still hot. Will you have some?\" Leo shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeatrix, missing the seething undercurrents in the air, launched herself at Leo and wrapped her arms around his thick waist. \"You were gone so long! So many things have happened—Merripen is ill, and I helped make a potion for him, and? She stopped, making a face. \"You smell bad. What?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me how you made the potion,\" Leo said gruffly, making his way to the stairs. Beatrix chattered without stopping as she accompanied him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam looked over Amelia carefully, not missing a detail. She was disheveled, her hair cascading down her back, her eyes tired. She needed to rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for finding him,\" she said. \"Where was he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At a private home with some friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drew closer to him, sniffing gingerly. \"That smell... it\u0027s on both of you ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Opium smoke. Your brother\u0027s taken up an expensive new habit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We couldn\u0027t afford the old ones.\" Amelia scowled, her foot beginning a restless staccato beneath her skirts. She was so small and fierce and adorable that Cam could barely restrain himself from snatching her up and kissing her senseless. \"The only reason I didn\u0027t murder him just now,\" Amelia continued, \"is because he looked too numb to feel it. But when he sobers I\u0027m going to?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is Merripen?\" Cam interrupted, running a gentle hand from her shoulder to her elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tapping stopped. \"Still feverish, but better. Win\u0027s with him. We changed his poultice... the wound looks a bit less disgusting than before. Is that a good sign?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a good sign.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer concerned gaze chased over him. \"Shall I get you something to eat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling, Cam shook his head. \"Not before I have a good, thorough wash.\" There were many things they needed to discuss, but it could all wait. \"Go to bed, monisha—you look weary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do you,\" Amelia said, standing on her toes. Cam held very still as she pressed her lips to his cheek. A long hesitation, and then she asked tentatively, \"Will you come to me tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shy invitation nearly undid him. Here was an opening—a sign of acceptance—but he cared too much about her to take advantage when she was obviously tired. \"No.\" He took her into his arms. \"You need to sleep more than you need my groping and fondling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flushed a little, and leaned harder against him. \"I don\u0027t mind your groping and fondling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam laughed. \"What a testament to my lovemaking skills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come to me,\" she whispered. \"Hold me while we sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hummingbird,\" he returned, his lips brushing her brow, \"if I hold you, I don\u0027t trust myself not to make love to you. So we\u0027ll sleep in separate beds.\" He looked down at her with a smile. \"Just for tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took three soapings and rinsings for Cam to remove the taint of opium from his skin and hair. After toweling his hair dry, he donned a black silk robe and walked through the darkened hallway to his room. It was storming outside, the rain and thunder sweeping in on an easterly, battering the windows and roof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hearth in his room had been replenished, the blaze shedding warmth and light. Cam\u0027s eyes narrowed in curiosity as he saw a small shape beneath the covers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia\u0027s head lifted from the pillow. \"I\u0027m cold,\" she said, as if that were a perfectly reasonable explanation for her presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My bed is no warmer than yours.\" Cam approached her slowly, trying not to feel like a predator, trying to ignore the heat that had ignited in his blood. His body had gone hard beneath the black silk, all his muscles tightening in anticipation. He knew what she wanted from him... and he would be more than happy to provide it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would be warmer if you were in it,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hair fell over her shoulders in dark ripples down to her hips. Sitting close beside her, Cam touched one of the shining locks, following it over her chest, the tip of her breast, down to the end. Amelia drew in a quick breath. He wondered if the blush on her face had spread to the skin he couldn\u0027t see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRestraining his urgent need, Cam held still as she reached out to him with hesitant fingers, stroking the black silk that covered his shoulders. She rose to her knees and impulsively kissed his ear, the one with the diamond stud, and touched the damp, slightly curling locks of his hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not like any man I\u0027ve ever known,\" she said. \"You\u0027re not even someone I could have dreamed. You\u0027re like someone from a fairy story written in a language I don\u0027t even know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The prince, I hope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you\u0027re the dragon, a beautiful wicked dragon.\" Her voice turned wistful. \"How could anyone have a normal everyday life with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam took her in a safe, firm grip and lowered her to the mattress. \"Maybe you\u0027ll be a civilizing influence on me.\" He bent over the slope of her breast, kissing it through the muslin veil of her gown. \"Or maybe you\u0027ll get a taste for the dragon.\" He found the bud of her nipple, wet the cotton with his mouth, until the tender flesh pricked up against his tongue. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine-till-midnight-the-hathaways-1/page-83.html","bookId":1788,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:07:20 PM"}
