{"id":107781,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\u003cp\u003eI FELT ABSOLUTELY HIDEOUS IN THE MORNING. I HADN\u0027T slept well; my arm burned and my head ached. It didn\u0027t help my outlook that Edward\u0027s face was smooth and remote as he kissed my forehead quickly and ducked out my window. I was afraid of the time I\u0027d spent unconscious, afraid that he might have been thinking about right and wrong again while he watched me sleep. The anxiety seemed to ratchet up the intensity of the pounding in my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward was waiting for me at school, as usual, but his face was still wrong. There was something buried in his eyes that I couldn\u0027t be sure of��and it scared me. I didn\u0027t want to bring up last night, but I wasn\u0027t sure if avoiding the subject would be worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened my door for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you feel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perfect,\" I lied, cringing as the sound of the slamming door echoed in my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked in silence, he shortening his stride to match mine. There were so many questions I wanted to ask, but most of those questions would have to wait, because chey were for Alice: How was Jasper this morning? What had they said when I was gone? What had Rosalie said? And most importantly, what could she see happening now in her strange, imperfect visions of the future? Could she guess what Edward was thinking, why he was so gloomy? Was there a foundation for the tenuous, instinctive fears that I couldn\u0027t seem to shake?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe morning passed slowly. I was impatient to see Alice, though I wouldn\u0027t be able to really talk to her with Edward there. Edward remained aloof. Occasionally he would ask about my arm, and I would lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice usually beat us to lunch; she didn\u0027t have to keep pace with a sloth like me. But she wasn\u0027t at the table, waiting with a tray of food she wouldn\u0027t eat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward didn\u0027t say anything about her absence. I wondered to myself if her class was running late��until I saw Conner and Ben, who were in her fourth hour French class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Alice?\" I asked Edward anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at the granola bar he was slowly pulverizing between his fingertips while he answered. \"She\u0027s with Jasper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s gone away for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward shrugged. \"Nowhere in particular.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Alice, too,\" I said with quiet desperation. Of course, if Jasper needed her, she would go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. She\u0027ll be gone for a while. She was trying to convince him to go to Denali.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenali was where the one other band of unique vampires��good ones like the Cullens��lived. Tanya and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher family. I\u0027d heard of them now and again. Edward had run to them last winter when my arrival had made Forks difficult for him. Laurent, the most civilized member of James\u0027s little coven, had gone there rather than siding with James against the Cullens. It made sense for Alice to encourage Jasper to go there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed, trying to dislodge the sudden lump in my throat. The guilt made my head bow and my shoulders slump. I\u0027d run them out of their home, just like Rosalie and Emmett. I was a plague.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is your arm bothering you?\" he asked solicitously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who cares about my stupid arm?\" I muttered in disgust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer, and I put my head down on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the end of the day, the silence was becoming ridiculous. I didn\u0027t want to be the one to break it, but apparently that was my only choice if I ever wanted him to talk to me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll come over later tonight?\" I asked as he walked me��silently��to my truck. He always came over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Later?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt pleased me that he seemed surprised. \"I have to work. I had to trade with Mrs. Newton to get yesterday off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027ll come over when I\u0027m home, though, right?\" I hated that I felt suddenly unsure about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you want me to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I always want you,\" I reminded him, with perhaps a little more intensity than the conversation required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI expected he would laugh, or smile, or react somehow to my words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, then,\" he said indifferently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed my forehead again before he shut the door on me. Then he turned his back and loped gracefully toward his car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was able to drive out of the parking lot before the panic really hit, but I was hyperventilating by the time I got to Newton\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just needed time, I told myself. He would get over this. Maybe he was sad because his family was disappearing. But Alice and Jasper would come back soon, and Rosalie and Emmett, too. If it would help, I would stay away from the big white house on the river��I\u0027d never set foot there again. That didn\u0027t matter. I\u0027d still see Alice at school. She would have to come back for school, right? And she was at my place all the time anyway. She wouldn\u0027t want to hurt Charlie\u0027s feelings by staying away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo doubt I would also run into Carlisle with regularity��in the emergency room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, what had happened last night was nothing. Nothing had happened. So I fell down��that was the story of my life. Compared to last spring, it seemed especially unimportant. James had left me broken and nearly dead from loss of blood��and yet Edward had handled the interminable weeks in the hospital much better than this. Was it because, this time, it wasn\u0027t an enemy he\u0027d had to protect me from? Because it was his brother?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it would be better if he took me away, rather than his family being scattered. I grew slightly less depressed as I considered all the uninterrupted alone time. If he could just last through the school year, Charlie wouldn\u0027t be able to object. We could go away to college, or pretend that\u0027s what we were doing, like Rosalie and Emmett this year. Surely Edward could wait a year. What was a year to an immortal? It didn\u0027t even seem like that much to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was able to talk myself into enough composure to handle getting out of the truck and walking to the store. Mike Newton had beaten me here today, and he smiled and waved when I came in. I grabbed my vest, nodding vaguely in his direction. I was still imagining pleasant scenarios that consisted of me running away with Edward to various exotic locales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike interrupted my fantasy. \"How was your birthday?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ugh,\" I mumbled. \"I\u0027m glad it\u0027s over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike looked at me from the corners of his eyes like I was crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWork dragged. I wanted to see Edward again, praying that he would be past the worst of this, whatever it was exactly, by the time I saw him again. It\u0027s nothing, I told myself over and over again. Everything will go back to normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe relief I felt when I turned onto my street and saw Edward\u0027s silver car parked in front of my house was an overwhelming, heady thing. And it bothered me deeply that it should be that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hurried through the front door, calling out before I was completely inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad? Edward?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I spoke, I could hear the distinctive theme music from ESPN\u0027s SportsCenter coming from the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In here,\" Charlie called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hung my raincoat on its peg and hurried around the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward was in the armchair, my father on the sofa. Both had their eyes trained on the TV. The focus was normal for my father. Not so much for Edward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" I said weakly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Bella,\" my father answered, eyes never moving. \"We just had cold pizza. I think it\u0027s still on the table.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited in the doorway. Finally, Edward looked over at me with a polite smile. \"I\u0027ll be right behind you,\" he promised. His eyes strayed back to the TV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared for another minute, shocked. Neither one seemed to notice. I could feel something, panic maybe, building up in my chest. I escaped to the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pizza held no interest for me. I sat in my chair, pulled my knees up, and wrapped my arms around them. Something was very wrong, maybe more wrong than I\u0027d realized. The sounds of male bonding and banter continued from the TV set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to get control of myself, to reason with myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0027s the worst that can happen? I flinched. That was definitely the wrong question to ask. I was having a hard time breathing right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, I thought again, what\u0027s the worst I can live through? I didn\u0027t like that question so much, either. But I thought through the possibilities I\u0027d considered today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaying away from Edward\u0027s family. Of course, he wouldn\u0027t expect Alice to be part of that. But if Jasper was off limits, that would lessen the time I could have with her. I nodded to myself��I could live with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr going away. Maybe he wouldn\u0027t want to wait till the end of the school year, maybe it would have to be now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn front of me, on the table, my presents from Charlie and Renee were where I had left them, the camera I hadn\u0027t had the chance to use at the Cullens\u0027 sitting beside the album. I touched the pretty cover of the scrapbook my mother had given me, and sighed, thinking of Renee. Somehow, living without her for as long as I had did not make the idea of a more permanent separation easier. And Charlie would be left all alone here, abandoned. They would both be so hurt��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we\u0027d come back, right? We\u0027d visit, of course, wouldn\u0027t we?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t be certain about the answer to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned my cheek against my knee, staring at the physical tokens of my parents\u0027 love. I\u0027d known this path I\u0027d chosen was going to be hard. And, after all, I was thinking about the worst-case scenario��the very worst I could live through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI touched the scrapbook again, flipping the front cover over. Little metal corners were already in place to hold the first picture. It wasn\u0027t a half-bad idea, to make some record of my life here. I felt a strange urge to get started. Maybe I didn\u0027t have that long left in Forks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI toyed with the wrist strap on the camera, wondering about the first picture on the roll. Could it possibly turn out anything close to the original? I doubted it. But he didn\u0027t seem worried that it would be blank. I chuckled to myself, thinking of his carefree laughter last night. The chuckle died away. So much had changed, and so abruptly. It made me feel a little bit dizzy, like I was standing on an edge, a precipice somewhere much too high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to think about that anymore. I grabbed the camera and headed up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy room hadn\u0027t really changed all that much in the seventeen years since my mother had been here. The walls were still light blue, the same yellowed lace curtains hung in front of the window. There was a bed, rather than a crib, but she would recognize the quilt draped untidily over the top��it had been a gift ROM Gran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless, I snapped a picture of my room. There wasn\u0027t much else I could do tonight��it was too dark outside��and the feeling was growing stronger, it was almost a compulsion now. I would record everything about Forks before I had to leave it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChange was coming. I could feel it. It wasn\u0027t a pleasant prospect, not when life was perfect the way it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took my time coming back down the stairs, camera in hand, trying to ignore the butterflies in my\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estomach as I thought of the strange distance I didn\u0027t want to see in Edward\u0027s eyes. He would get over this. Probably he was worried that I would be upset when he asked me to leave. I would let him work through it without meddling. And I would be prepared when he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had the camera ready as I leaned around the corner, being sneaky. I was sure there was no chance that I had caught Edward by surprise, but he didn\u0027t look up. I felt a brief shiver as something icy twisted in my stomach; I ignored that and took the picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both looked at me then. Charlie frowned. Edward\u0027s face was empty, expressionless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing, Bella?\" Charlie complained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on.\" I pretended to smile as I went to sit on the floor in front of the sofa where Charlie lounged. \"You know Mom will be calling soon to ask if I\u0027m using my presents. I have to get to work before she can get her feelings hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you taking pictures of me, though?\" he grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you\u0027re so handsome,\" I replied, keeping it light. \"And because, since you bought the camera, you\u0027re obligated to be one of my subjects.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe mumbled something unintelligible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Edward,\" I said with admirable indifference. \"Take one of me and my dad together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI threw the camera toward him, carefully avoiding his eyes, and knelt beside the arm of the sofa where Charlie\u0027s face was. Charlie sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to smile, Bella,\" Edward murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did my best, and the camera flashed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me take one of you kids,\" Charlie suggested. I knew he was just trying to shift the camera\u0027s focus fromhimself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward stood and lightly tossed him the camera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to stand beside Edward, and the arrangement felt formal and strange to me. He put one hand lightly on my shoulder, and I wrapped my arm more securely around his waist. I wanted to look at his face, but I was afraid to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smile, Bella,\" Charlie reminded me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath and smiled. The flash blinded me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough pictures for tonight,\" Charlie said then, shoving the camera into a crevice of the sofa cushions and rolling over it. \"You don\u0027t have to use the whole roll now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward dropped his hand from my shoulder and twisted casually out of my arm. He sat back down in the armchair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated, and then went to sit against the sofa again. I was suddenly so frightened that my hands were shaking. I pressed them into my stomach to hide them, put my chin on my knees and stared at the TV screen in front of me, seeing nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the show ended, I hadn\u0027t moved an inch. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Edward stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d better get home,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie didn\u0027t look up from the commercial. \"See ya.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got awkwardly to my feet��I was stiff from sitting so still��and followed Edward out the front door. He went straight to his car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you stay?\" I asked, no hope in my voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI expected his answer, so it didn\u0027t hurt as much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t ask for a reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got in his car and drove away while I stood there, unmoving. I barely noticed that it was raining. I waited, without knowing what I waited for, until the door opened behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella, what are you doing?\" Charlie asked, surprised to see me standing there alone and dripping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\" I turned and trudged back to the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a long night, with little in the way of rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up as soon as there was a faint light outside my window. I dressed for school mechanically, waiting for the clouds to brighten. When I had eaten a bowl of cereal, I decided that it was light enough for pictures. I took one of my truck, and then the front of the house. I turned and snapped a few of the forest by Charlie\u0027s house. Funny how it didn\u0027t seem sinister like it used to. I realized I would miss this��the green, the timelessness, the mystery of the woods. All of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put the camera in my school bag before I left. I tried to concentrate on my new project rather than the fact that Edward apparently hadn\u0027t gotten over things during the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong with the fear, I was beginning to feel impatience. How long could this last?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt lasted through the morning. He walked silently beside me, never seeming to actually look at me. I tried to concentrate on my classes, but not even English could hold my attention. Mr. Berty had to repeat his question about Lady Capulet twice before I realized he was talking to me. Edward whispered the correct answer under his breath and then went back to ignoring me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt lunch, the silence continued. I felt like I was going to start screaming at any moment, so, to distract myself, I leaned across the table\u0027s invisible line and spoke to Jessica.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Jess?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s up, Bella?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you do me a favor?\" I asked, reaching into my bag. \"My mom wants me to get some pictures of my friends for a scrapbook. So, take some pictures of everybody, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI handed her the camera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" she said, grinning, and turned to snap a candid shot of Mike with his mouth full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA predictable picture war ensued. I watched them hand the camera around the table, giggling and flirting and complaining about being on film. It seemed strangely childish. Maybe I just wasn\u0027t in the mood for normal human behavior today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-oh,\" Jessica said apologetically as she returned the camera. \"I think we used all your film.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s okay. I think I already got pictures of everything else I needed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter school, Edward walked me back to the parking lot in silence. I had to work again, and for once, I was glad. Time with me obviously wasn\u0027t helping things. Maybe time alone would be better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dropped my film off at the Thriftway on my way to Newton\u0027s, and then picked up the developed pictures after work. At home, I said a brief hi to Charlie, grabbed a granola bar from the kitchen, and hurried up to my room with the envelope of photographs tucked under my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat in the middle of my bed and opened the envelope with wary curiosity. Ridiculously, I still half expected the first print to be a blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I pulled it out, I gasped aloud. Edward looked just as beautiful as he did in real life, staring at me out of the picture with the warm eyes I\u0027d missed for the past few days. It was almost uncanny that anyone could look so�� so�� beyond description. No thousand words could equal this picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flipped through the rest of the stack quickly once, and then laid three of them out on the bed side by side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first was the picture of Edward in the kitchen, his warm eyes touched with tolerant amusement. The second was Edward and Charlie, watching ESPN. The difference in Edward\u0027s expression was severe. His eyes were careful here, reserved. Still breathtakingly beautiful, but his face was colder, more like a sculpture, less alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last was the picture of Edward and me standing awkwardly side by side. Edward\u0027s face was the same as the last, cold and statue-like. But that wasn\u0027t the most troubling part of this photograph. The contrast between the two of us was painful. He looked like a god. I looked very average, even for a human, almost shamefully plain. I flipped the picture over with a feeling of disgust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of doing my homework, I stayed up to put my pictures into the album. With a ballpoint pen I scrawled captions under all the pictures, the names and the dates. I got to the picture of Edward and me, and, without looking at it too long, I folded it in half and stuck it under the metal tab, Edward-side up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was done, I stuffed the second set of prints in a fresh envelope and penned a long thank-you letter to Renee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward still hadn\u0027t come over. I didn\u0027t want to admit that he was the reason I\u0027d stayed up so late, but of course he was. I tried to remember the last time he\u0027d stayed away like this, without an excuse, a phone call�� He never had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, I didn\u0027t sleep well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchool followed the silent, frustrating, terrifying pattern of the last two days. I felt relief when I saw Edward waiting for me in the parking lot, but it faded quickly. He was no different, unless maybe more remote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard to even remember the reason for all this mess. My birthday already felt like the distant past. If only Alice would come back. Soon. Before this got any more out of hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I couldn\u0027t count on that. I decided that, if I couldn\u0027t talk to him today, really talk, then I was going to see Carlisle tomorrow. I had to do something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter school, Edward and I were going to talk it out, I promised myself. I wasn\u0027t accepting any excuses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked me to my truck, and I steeled myself to make my demands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you mind if I come over today?\" he asked before we got to the truck, beating me to the punch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now?\" he asked again, opening my door for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" I kept my voice even, though I didn\u0027t like the urgency in his tone. \"I was just going to drop a letter for Renee in the mailbox on the way. I\u0027ll meet you there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at the fat envelope on the passenger seat. Suddenly, he reached over me and snagged it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do it,\" he said quietly. \"And I\u0027ll still beat you there.\" He smiled my favorite crooked smile, but it was wrong. It didn\u0027t reach his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I agreed, unable to smile back. He shut the door, and headed toward his car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did beat me home. He was parked in Charlie\u0027s spot when I pulled up in front of the house. That was a bad sign. He didn\u0027t plan to stay, then. I shook my head and took a deep breath, trying to locate some courage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got out of his car when I stepped out of the truck, and came to meet me. He reached to take my book bag from me. That was normal. But he shoved it back onto the seat. That was not normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come for a walk with me,\" he suggested in an unemotional voice, taking my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t answer. I couldn\u0027t think of a way to protest, but I instantly knew that I wanted to. I didn\u0027t like this. This is bad, this is very bad, the voice in my head repeated again and again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn\u0027t wait for an answer. He pulled me along toward the east side of the yard, where the forest encroached. I followed unwillingly, trying to think through the panic. It was what I wanted, I reminded myself. The chance to talk it all through. So why was the panic choking me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027d gone only a few steps into the trees when he stopped. We were barely on the trail��I could still see the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward leaned against a tree and stared at me, his expression unreadable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, let\u0027s talk,\" I said. It sounded braver than it felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella, we\u0027re leaving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath, too. This was an acceptable option. I thought I was prepared. But I still had to ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why now? Another year��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella, it\u0027s time. How much longer could we stay in Forks, after all? Carlisle can barely pass for thirty, and he\u0027s claiming thirty-three now. We\u0027d have to start over soon regardless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis answer confused me. I thought the point of leaving was to let his family live in peace. Why did we have to leave if they were going? I stared at him, trying to understand what he meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared back coldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a roll of nausea, I realized I\u0027d misunderstood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you say we��,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean my family and myself.\" Each word separate and distinct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head back and forth mechanically, trying to clear it. He waited without any sign of impatience. It took a few minutes before I could speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll come with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t, Bella. Where we\u0027re going�� It\u0027s not the right place for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where you are is the right place for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m no good for you, Bella.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be ridiculous.\" I wanted to sound angry, but it just sounded like I was begging. \"You\u0027re the very best part of my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My world is not for you,\" he said grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened with Jasper��that was nothing, Edward! Nothing!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right,\" he agreed. \"It was exactly what was to be expected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You promised! In Phoenix, you promised that you would stay��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As long as that was best for you,\" he interrupted to correct me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! This is about my soul, isn\u0027t it?\" I shouted, furious, the words exploding out of me��somehow it still sounded like a plea. \"Carlisle told me about that, and I don\u0027t care, Edward. I don\u0027t care! You can have my soul. I don\u0027t want it without you��it\u0027s yours already!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath and stared, unseeingly, at the ground for a long moment. His mouth twisted the tiniest bit. When he finally looked up, his eyes were different, harder��like the liquid gold had frozen solid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella, I don\u0027t want you to come with me.\" He spoke the words slowly and precisely, his cold eyes on my face, watching as I absorbed what he was really saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause as I repeated the words in my head a few times, sifting through them for their real intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You�� don\u0027t�� want me?\" I tried out the words, confused by the way they sounded, placed in that order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared, uncomprehending, into his eyes. He stared back without apology. His eyes were like topaz��hard and clear and very deep. I felt like I could see into them for miles and miles, yet nowhere in rheir bottomless depths could I see a contradiction to the word he\u0027d spoken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that changes things.\" I was surprised by how calm and reasonable my voice sounded. It must be because I was so numb. I couldn\u0027t realize what he was telling me. It still didn\u0027t make any sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked away into the trees as he spoke again. \"Of course, I\u0027ll always love you�� in a way. But what happened the other night made me realize that it\u0027s time for a change. Because I\u0027m�� tired of pretending to be something I\u0027m not, Bella. I am not human.\" He looked back, and the icy planes of his perfect face were not human. \"I\u0027ve let this go on much too long, and I\u0027m sorry for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t.\" My voice was just a whisper now; awareness was beginning to seep through me, trickling like acid through my veins. \"Don\u0027t do this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just stared at me, and I could see from his eyes that my words were far too late. He already had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not good for me, Bella.\" He turned his earlier words around, and so I had no argument. How well I knew that I wasn\u0027t good enough for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth to say something, and then closed it again. He waited patiently, his face wiped clean of all emotion. I tried again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If�� that\u0027s what you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy whole body went numb. I couldn\u0027t feel anything below the neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would like to ask one favor, though, if that\u0027s not too much,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder what he saw on my face, because something flickered across his own face in response. But, before I could identify it, he\u0027d composed his features into the same serene mask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything,\" I vowed, my voice faintly stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I watched, his frozen eyes melted. The gold became liquid again, molten, burning down into mine with an intensity that was overwhelming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t do anything reckless or stupid,\" he ordered, no longer detached. \"Do you understand what I\u0027m saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded helplessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes cooled, the distance returned. \"I\u0027m thinking of Charlie, of course. He needs you. Take care of yourself��for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded again. \"I will,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to relax just a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027ll make you a promise in return,\" he said. \"I promise that this will be the last time you\u0027ll see me. I won\u0027t come back. I won\u0027t put you through anything like this again. You can go on with your life without any more interference from me. It will be as if I\u0027d never existed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy knees must have started to shake, because the trees were suddenly wobbling. I could hear the blood pounding faster than normal behind my ears. His voice sounded farther away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled gently. \"Don\u0027t worry. You\u0027re human��your memory is no more than a sieve. Time heals all wounds for your kind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And your memories?\" I asked. It sounded like there was something stuck in my throat, like I was choking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well\"��he hesitated for a short second��\"I won\u0027t forget. But my kind�� we\u0027re very easily distracted.\" He smiled; the smile was tranquil and it did not touch his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a step away from me. \"That\u0027s everything, I suppose. We won\u0027t bother you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plural caught my attention. That surprised me; I would have thought I was beyond noticing anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alice isn\u0027t coming back,\" I realized. I don\u0027t know how he heard me��the words made no sound��but he seemed to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head slowly, always watching my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. They\u0027re all gone. I staved behind to tell you goodbye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alice is gone?\" My voice was blank with disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She wanted to say goodbye, but I convinced her that a clean break would be better for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was dizzy; it was hard to concentrate. His words swirled around in my head, and I heard the doctor at the hospital in Phoenix, last spring, as he showed me the X-rays. You can see it\u0027s a clean break, his finger traced along the picture of my severed bone. That\u0027s good. It will heal more easily, more quickly .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to breathe normally. I needed to concentrate, to find a way out of this nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goodbye, Bella,\" he said in the same quiet, peaceful voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait!\" I choked out the word, reaching for him, willing my deadened legs to carry me forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought he was reaching for me, too. But his cold hands locked around my wrists and pinned them to my sides. He leaned down, and pressed his lips very lightly to my forehead for the briefest instant. My eyes closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take care of yourself,\" he breathed, cool against my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a light, unnatural breeze. My eyes flashed open. The leaves on a small vine maple shuddered with the gentle wind of his passage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith shaky legs, ignoring the fact that my action was useless, I followed him into the forest. The evidence of his path had disappeared instantly. There were no footprints, the leaves were still again, but I walked forward without thinking. I could not do anything else. I had to keep moving. If I stopped looking for him, it was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLove, life, meaning�� over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked and walked. Time made no sense as I pushed slowly through the thick undergrowth. It was hours passing, but also only seconds. Maybe it felt like time had frozen because the forest looked the same no matter how far I went. I started to worry that I was traveling in a circle, a very small circle at that, but I kept going. I stumbled often, and, as it grew darker and darker, I fell often, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I tripped over something��it was black now, I had no idea what caught my foot��and I stayed down. I rolled onto my side, so that I could breathe, and curled up on the wet bracken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I lay there, I had a feeling that more time was passing than I realized. I couldn\u0027t remember how long it had been since nightfall. Was it always so dark here at night? Surely, as a rule, some little bit of moonlight would filter down through the clouds, through the chinks in the canopy of trees, and find the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot tonight. Tonight the sky was utterly black. Perhaps there was no moon tonight��a lunar eclipse, a new moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new moon. I shivered, though I wasn\u0027t cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was black for a long time before I heard them calling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone was shouting my name. It was muted, muffled by the wet growth that surrounded me, but it was definitely my name. I didn\u0027t recognize the voice. I thought about answering, but I was dazed, and it took a long time to come to the conclusion that I should answer. By then, the calling had stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometime later, the rain woke me up. I don\u0027t think I\u0027d really fallen asleep; I was just lost in an unthinking stupor, holding with all my strength to the numbness that kept me from realizing what I didn\u0027t want to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rain bothered me a little. It was cold. I unwrapped my arms from around my legs to cover my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was then that I heard the calling again. It was farther away this time, and sometimes it sounded like several voices were calling at once. I tried to breathe deeply. I remembered that I should answer, but I didn\u0027t think they would be able to hear me. Would I be able to shout loud enough?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, there was another sound, startlingly close. A kind of snuffling, an animal sound. It sounded big. I wondered if I should feel afraid. I didn\u0027t��just numb. It didn\u0027t matter. The snuffling went away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rain continued, and I could feel the water pooling up against my cheek. I was trying to gather the strength to turn my head when I saw the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first it was just a dim glow reflecting off the bushes in the distance. It grew brighter and brighter, illuminating a large space unlike the focused beam of a flashlight. The light broke through the closest brush, and I could see that it was a propane lantern, but that was all I could see��the brightness blinded me for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice was deep and unfamiliar, but full of recognition. He wasn\u0027t calling my name to search, he was acknowledging that I was found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared up��impossibly high it seemed��at the dark face that I could now see above me. I was vaguely aware that the stranger probably only looked so tall because my head was still on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you been hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew the words meant something, but I could only stare, bewildered. How could the meaning matter at this point?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella, my name is Sam Uley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing familiar about his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlie sent me to look for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie? That struck a chord, and I tried to pay more attention to what he was saying. Charlie mattered, if nothing else did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tall man held out a hand. I gazed at it, not sure what I was supposed to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis black eyes appraised me for a second, and then he shrugged. In a quick and supple notion, he pulled me up from the ground and into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hung there, limp, as he loped swiftly through the wet forest. Some part of me knew this should upset me��being carried away by a stranger. But there was nothing left in me to upset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t seem like too much time passed before there were lights and the deep babble of many male voices. Sam Uley slowed as he approached the commotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got her!\" he called in a booming voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe babble ceased, and then picked up again with more intensity. A confusing swirl of faces moved over me. Sam\u0027s voice was the only one that made sense in the chaos, perhaps because my ear was against his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t think she\u0027s hurt,\" he told someone. \"She just keeps saying \u0027He\u0027s gone.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas I saying that out loud? I bit down on my lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella, honey, are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was one voice I would know anywhere��even distorted, as it was now, with worry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlie?\" My voice sounded strange and small.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m right here, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a shifting under me, followed by the leathery smell of my dad\u0027s sheriff jacket. Charlie staggered under my weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I should hold on to her,\" Sam Uley suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got her,\" Charlie said, a little breathless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked slowly, struggling. I wished I could tell him to put me down and let me walk, but I couldn\u0027t find my voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were lights everywhere, held by the crowd walking with him. It felt like a parade. Or a funeral procession. I closed my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re almost home now, honey,\" Charlie mumbled now and then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my eyes again when I heard the door unlock. We were on the porch of our house, and the tall dark man named Sam was holding the door for Charlie, one arm extended toward us, as if he was preparing to catch me when Charlie\u0027s arms failed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Charlie managed to get me through the door and to the couch in the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad, I\u0027m all wet,\" I objected feebly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t matter.\" His voice was gruff. And then he was talking to someone else. \"Blankets are in the cupboard at the top of the stairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella?\" a new voice asked. I looked at the gray-haired man leaning over me, and recognition came after a few slow seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Gerandy?\" I mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right, dear,\" he said. \"Are you hurt, Bella?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me a minute to think that through. I was confused by the memory of Sam Uley\u0027s similar question in the woods. Only Sam had asked something else: Have you been hurt? he\u0027d said. The difference seemed significant somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Gerandy was waiting. One grizzled eyebrow rose, and the wrinkles on his forehead deepened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not hurt,\" I lied. The words, were true enough for what he\u0027d asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis warm hand touched my forehead, and his fingers pressed against the inside of my wrist. I watched his lips as he counted to himself, his eyes on his watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to you?\" he asked casually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI froze under his hand, tasting panic in the back of my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you get lost in the woods?\" he prodded. I was aware of several other people listening. Three tall men with dark faces��from La Push, the Quileute Indian reservation down on the coastline, I guessed��Sam Uley among them, were standing very close together and staring at me. Mr. Newton was there with Mike and Mr. Weber, Angela\u0027s father; they all were watching me more surreptitiously than the strangers. Other deep voices rumbled from the kitchen and outside the front door. Half the town must have been looking for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie was the closest. He leaned in to hear my answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I whispered. \"I got lost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor nodded, thoughtful, his fingers probing gently against the glands under my jaw. Charlie\u0027s face hardened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you feel tired?\" Dr. Gerandy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and closed my eyes obediently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything wrong with her,\" I heard the doctor mutter to Charlie after a moment. \"Just exhaustion. Let her sleep it off, and I\u0027ll come check on her tomorrow,\" he paused. He must have looked at his watch, because he added, \"Well, later today actually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a creaking sound as they both pushed off from the couch to get to their feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it true?\" Charlie whispered. Their voices were farther away now. I strained to hear. \"Did they leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Cullen asked us not to say anything,\" Dr. Gerandy answered. \"The offer was very sudden; they had to choose immediately. Carlisle didn\u0027t want to make a big production out of leaving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little warning might have been nice,\" Charlie grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Gerandy sounded uncomfortable when he replied. \"Yes, well, in this situation, some warning might have been called for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to listen anymore. I felt around for the edge of the quilt someone had laid on top of me, and pulled it over my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drifted in and out of alertness. I heard Charlie whisper thanks to the volunteers as, one by one, they left. I felt his fingers on my forehead, and then the weight of another blanket. The phone rang a few times, and he hurried to catch it before it could wake me. He muttered reassurances in a low voice to the callers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, we found her. She\u0027s okay. She got lost. She\u0027s fine now,\" he said again and again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard the springs in the armchair groan when he settled himself in for the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later, the phone rang again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie moaned as he struggled to his feet, and then he rushed, stumbling, to the kitchen I pulled my head deeper under the blankets, not wanting to listen to the same conversation again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Charlie said, and yawned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice changed, it was much more alert when he spoke again. \"Where?\u0027\" There was a pause. \"You\u0027re sure it\u0027s outside the reservation?\" Another short pause. \"But what could be burning out there?\" He sounded both worried and mystified. \"Look, I\u0027ll call down there and check it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI listened with more interest as he punched in a number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Billy, it\u0027s Charlie��sorry I\u0027m calling so early�� no, she\u0027s fine. She\u0027s sleeping�� Thanks, but that\u0027s not why I called. I just got a call from Mrs. Stanley, and she says that from her second-story window she can see fires out on the sea cliffs, but I didn\u0027t really�� Oh!\" Suddenly there was an edge in his voice��irritation�� or anger. \"And why are they doing that? Uh huh. Really?\" He said it sarcastically. \"Well, don\u0027t apologize to me. Yeah, yeah. Just make sure the flames don\u0027t spread�� I know, I know, I\u0027m surprised they got them lit at all in this weather.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie hesitated, and then added grudgingly. \"Thanks for sending Sam and the other boys up. You were right��they do know the forest better than we do. It was Sam who found her, so I owe you one�� Yeah, I\u0027ll talk to you later,\" he agreed, still sour, before hanging up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie muttered something incoherent as he shuffled back to the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hurried to my side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry I woke you, honey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is something burning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s nothing,\" he assured me. \"Just some bonfires out on the cliffs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bonfires?\" I asked. My voice didn\u0027t sound curious. It sounded dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie frowned. \"Some of the kids from the reservation being rowdy,\" he explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I wondered dully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could tell he didn\u0027t want to answer. He looked at the floor under his knees. \"They\u0027re celebrating the news.\" His tone was bitter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only one piece of news I could think of, try as I might not to. And then the pieces snapped together. \"Because the Cullens left,\" I whispered. \"They don\u0027t like the Cullens in La Push��I\u0027d forgotten about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Quileutes had their superstitions about the \"cold ones,\" the blood-drinkers that were enemies to their tribe, just like they had their legends of the great flood and wolf-men ancestors. Just stories, folklore, to most of them. Then there were the few that believed. Charlie\u0027s good friend Billy Black believed, though even Jacob, his own son, thought he was full of stupid superstitions. Billy had warned me to stay away from the Cullens��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe name stirred something inside me, something that began to claw its way toward the surface, something I knew I didn\u0027t want to face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s ridiculous,\" Charlie spluttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sat in silence for a moment. The sky was no longer black outside the window. Somewhere behind the rain, the sun was beginning to rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella?\" Charlie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him uneasily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He left you alone in the woods?\" Charlie guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI deflected his question. \"How did you know where to find me?\" My mind shied away from the inevitable awareness that was coming, coming quickly now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your note,\" Charlie answered. surprised. He reached into the back pocket of his jeans and pulled out a much-abused piece of paper. It was dirty and damp, with multiple creases from being opened and refolded many times. He unfolded it again, and held it up as evidence. The messy handwriting was remarkably close to my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing for a walk with Edward, up the path, it said. Back soon, B.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you didn\u0027t come back, I called the Cullens, and no one answered,\" Charlie said in a low voice. \"Then I called the hospital, and Dr. Gerandy told me that Carlisle was gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did they go?\" I mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me. \"Didn\u0027t Edward tell you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, recoiling. The sound of his name unleashed the thing that was clawing inside of me��a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epain that knocked me breathless, astonished me with its force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie eyed me doubtfully as he answered. \"Carlisle took a job with a big hospital in Los Angeles. I guess they threw a lot of money at him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunny L.A. The last place they would really go. I remembered my nightmare with the mirror�� the bright sunlight shimmering off of his skin��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgony ripped through me with the memory of his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to know if Edward left you alone out there in the middle of the woods,\" Charlie insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis name sent another wave of torture through me. I shook my head, frantic, desperate to escape the pain. \"It was my fault. He left me right here on the trail, in sight of the house�� but I tried to follow him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie started to say something; childishly, I covered my ears. \"I can\u0027t talk about this anymore, Dad. I want to go to my room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he could answer, I scrambled up from the couch and lurched my way up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone had been in the house to leave a note for Charlie, a note that would lead him to find me. From the minute that I\u0027d realized this, a horrible suspicion began to grow in my head. I rushed to my room, shutting and locking the door behind me before I ran to the CD player by my bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything looked exactly the same as I\u0027d left it. I pressed down on the top of the CD player. The latch unhooked, and the lid slowly swung open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe album Renee had given me sat on the floor beside the bed, just where I\u0027d put it last. I lifted the cover with a shaking hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t have to flip any farther than the first page. The little metal corners no longer held a picture in place. The page was blank except for my own handwriting scrawled across the bottom: Edward Cullen, Charlie\u0027s kitchen, Sept. 13th.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped there. I was sure that he would have been very thorough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt will be as if I\u0027d never existed, he\u0027d promised me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt the smooth wooden floor beneath my knees, and then the palms of my hands, and then it was pressed against the skin of my cheek. I hoped that I was fainting, but, to my disappointment, I didn\u0027t lose consciousness. The waves of pain that had only lapped at me before now reared high up and washed over my head, pulling me under.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not resurface. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-2-new-moon-twilight-2/page-4.html","bookId":2024,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:55 PM"}
