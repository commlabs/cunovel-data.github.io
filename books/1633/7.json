Who else but Beta-5 Division even has the resources to use this data?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Spare me the banter, Déjà. I’m not in the mood. Just concentrate on the decryption.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Doctor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey paced across the antiseptic white tile of the Observation Room. One side of the room was filled with floor-to-ceiling terminals that monitored the vital signs of the children— test subjects, she corrected herself. They displayed drug uptake rates and winking green, blue, and red status indicators: EKGs, pulse rates, and a hundred other pieces of medical data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other side of the observation room overlooked dozens of translucent domes, windows into the surgical bays on the level below. Each bay was a sealed environment, staffed with the best surgeons and biotechnicians that the Office of Naval Intelligence could drum up. The bays had been scrubbed and irradiated and were in the final preparation stages to receive and hold the special biohazardous materials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Done,” Déjà announced. “The file awaits your inspection, Doctor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey stopped her pacing and sat. “On my glasses, please, Déjà.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer glasses scanned retinal and brain patterns, and the security barrier of the file lifted. With a blink of her eyes, she opened the file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnited Nations Space Command Priority Transmission 09872H-98\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEncryption Code:Red\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePublic Key:file /excised access Omega\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom:Admiral Ysionris Jeromi, Chief Medical Officer, UNSC Research Station Hopeful To:Dr. Catherine Elizabeth Halsey M.D., Ph.D., special civilian consultant (civilian Identification Number: 10141-026-SRB4695)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSubject:Mitigating factors and relative biological risks associated with queried experimental medical procedures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClassification:RESTRICTED (BGX Directive)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e/start file\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am afraid further analysis has yielded no viable alternatives to mitigate the risks in your proposed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“hypothetical” experimentation. I have, however, attached the synopsis of my team’s findings as well as all relevant case studies. Perhaps you will find them useful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope it is a hypothetical study . . . the use of Binobo chimpanzees in your proposal is troublesome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese animals are expensive and rare now since they are no longer bred in captivity. I would hate to see such valuable specimens wasted in some Section Three project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBest,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ey.j.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe winced at the veiled rebuke in the Admiral’s communiqué. He had never approved of her decision to work with the Office of Naval Intelligence, and made his disappointment with his star pupil evident every time she visited Hopeful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard enough to justify the morality of the course she was about to embark upon. Jeromi’s disapproval only made her decision more difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey gritted her teeth and returned to the report.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSynopsis of chemical/ biological risks\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWARNING: the following procedures are classified level-3 experimental. Primate test subjects must be cleared through UNSC Quartermaster General Office code: OBF34. Follow gamma code biohazard disposal protocol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1. Carbide ceramic ossification: advanced material grafting onto skeletal structures to make bones virtually unbreakable. Recommended coverage not to exceed 3 percent total bone mass because of significant white blood cell necrosis. Specific risk for pre- and near-postpubescent adolescents: skeletal growth spurts may cause irreparable bone pulverization. See attached case studies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Muscular enhancement injections: protein complex is injected intramuscularly to increase tissue density and decrease lactase recovery time. Risk: 5 percent of test subjects experience a fatal cardiac volume increase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3. Catalytic thyroid implant: platinum pellet containing human growth hormone catalyst is implanted in the thyroid to boost growth of skeletal and muscle tissues. Risk: rare instances of elephantiasis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuppressed sexual drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4. Occipital capillary reversal: submergence and boosted blood vessel flow beneath the rods and cones of subject’s retina. Produces a marked visual perception increase. Risk: retinal rejection and detachment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePermanent blindness. See attached autopsy reports.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5. Superconducting fibrification of neural dendrites: alteration of bioelectrical nerve transduction to shielded electronic transduction. Three hundred percent increase in subject reflexes. Anecdotal evidence of marked increase in intelligence, memory, and creativity. Risk: significant instances of Parkinson’s disease and Fletcher’s syndrome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e/end file\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePressENTER to open linked attachments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey closed the file. She erased all traces of it—sent Déjà to track the file pathways all the way back to Hopeful and destroy Admiral Jeromi’s notes and files relative to this incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe removed her glasses and pinched the bridge of her nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” Déjà said. “I, too, had hoped there would be some new process to lower the risks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey sighed. “I have doubts, Déjà. I thought the reasons so compelling when we first started project SPARTAN. Now? I . . . I just don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have been over the ONI projections of Outer Colony stability three times, Doctor. Their conclusion is correct: massive rebellion within twenty years unless drastic military action is taken. And you know the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘drastic military action’ the brass would like. The SPARTANS are our only option to avoid overwhelming civilian losses. They will be the perfect pinpoint strike force. They can prevent a civil war.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only if they survive to fulfill that mission,” Dr. Halsey countered. “We should delay the procedures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore research needs to be done. We could use the time to work on MJOLNIR. We need time to—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is another reason to proceed expeditiously,” Déjà said. “Although I am loath to bring this to your attention, I must. If the Office of Naval Intelligence detects a delay in their prize project, you will likely be replaced by someone who harbors . . . fewer doubts. And regrettably for the children, most likely someone less qualified.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hate this.” Dr. Halsey got up and strode to the fire exit. “And sometimes, Déjà, I hate you, too.” She left the observation room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMendez was waiting for her in the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Walk with me, Chief,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe followed without a word as they took the stairs to the pre-op wing of the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey entered room 117. John lay in bed and an IV drip was attached to his arm. His head had been shaved and incision vectors had been lasered onto his entire body. Despite these indignities, Dr. Halsey marveled at what a spectacular physical specimen he had grown into. Fourteen years old and he had the body of an eighteen-year-old Olympic athlete, and a mind the equal of any Naval Academy honors graduate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey forced the best smile she could muster. “How are you feeling?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine, ma’am,” John replied groggily. “The nurse said the sedation would take effect soon. I’m fighting it to see how long I can stay awake.” His eyelids fluttered. “It’s not easy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn spotted Mendez and he struggled to sit up and salute, but failed. “I know this is one of the Chief’s exercises. But I don’t know what the twist is. Can you tell me, Dr. Halsey? Just this time? How do I win?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMendez looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey leaned closer to John as he closed his eyes and started to breathe deeply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll tell you how to win, John,” she whispered. “You have to survive.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-the-fall-of-reach-halo-1/page-7.html","bookId":1633,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:23:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:23:12 PM"}
