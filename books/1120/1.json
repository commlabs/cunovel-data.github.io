and, as far as he could see, he had no ground for anticipating disappointment. \u0026nbsp;They were clever, good-looking, well-disposed young people, and upon the whole it may be said that the sun shone brightly on Thwaite Hall. \u0026nbsp;Of Mrs. Garrow it may suffice to say that she always deserved such sunshine.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For years past it had been the practice of the family to have some sort of gathering at Thwaite Hall during Christmas. \u0026nbsp;Godfrey Holmes had been left under the guardianship of Major Garrow, and, as he had always spent his Christmas holidays with his guardian, this, perhaps, had given rise to the practice. \u0026nbsp;Then the Coverdales were cousins of the Garrows, and they had usually been there as children. \u0026nbsp;At the Christmas last past the custom had been broken, for young Holmes had been abroad. \u0026nbsp;Previous to that, they had all been children, excepting him. \u0026nbsp;But now that they were to meet again, they were no longer children. \u0026nbsp;Elizabeth, at any rate, was not so, for she had already counted nineteen winters. \u0026nbsp;And Isabella Holmes was coming. \u0026nbsp;Now Isabella was two years older than Elizabeth, and had been educated in Brussels; moreover she was comparatively a stranger at Thwaite Hall, never having been at those early Christmas meetings.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And now I must take permission to begin my story by telling a lady’s secret. \u0026nbsp;Elizabeth Garrow had already been in love with Godfrey Holmes, or perhaps it might be more becoming to say that Godfrey Holmes had already been in love with her. \u0026nbsp;They had already been engaged; and, alas! they had already agreed that that engagement should be broken off!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Young Holmes was now twenty-seven years of age, and was employed in a bank at Liverpool, not as a clerk, but as assistant-manager, with a large salary. \u0026nbsp;He was a man well to do in the world, who had money also of his own, and who might well afford to marry. \u0026nbsp;Some two years since, on the eve of leaving Thwaite Hall, he had with low doubting whisper told Elizabeth that he loved her, and she had flown trembling to her mother. \u0026nbsp;“Godfrey, my boy,” the father said to him, as he parted with him the next morning, “Bessy is only a child, and too young to think of this yet.” \u0026nbsp;At the next Christmas Godfrey was in Italy, and the thing was gone by,—so at least the father and mother said to each other. \u0026nbsp;But the young people had met in the summer, and one joyful letter had come from the girl home to her mother. \u0026nbsp;“I have accepted him. \u0026nbsp;Dearest, dearest mamma, I do love him. \u0026nbsp;But don’t tell papa yet, for I have not quite accepted him. \u0026nbsp;I think I am sure, but I am not quite sure. \u0026nbsp;I am not quite sure about him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And then, two days after that, there had come a letter that was not at all joyful. \u0026nbsp;“Dearest Mamma,—It is not to be. \u0026nbsp;It is not written in the book. \u0026nbsp;We have both agreed that it will not do. \u0026nbsp;I am so glad that you have not told dear papa, for I could never make him understand. \u0026nbsp;You will understand, for I shall tell you everything, down to his very words. \u0026nbsp;But we have agreed that there shall be no quarrel. \u0026nbsp;It shall be exactly as it was, and he will come at Christmas all the same. \u0026nbsp;It would never do that he and papa should be separated, nor could we now put off Isabella. \u0026nbsp;It is better so in every way, for there is and need be no quarrel. \u0026nbsp;We still like each other. \u0026nbsp;I am sure I like him, but I know that I should not make him happy as his wife. \u0026nbsp;He says it is my fault. \u0026nbsp;I, at any rate, have never told him that I thought it his.” \u0026nbsp;From all which it will be seen that the confidence between the mother and daughter was very close.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Elizabeth Garrow was a very good girl, but it might almost be a question whether she was not too good. \u0026nbsp;She had learned, or thought that she had learned, that most girls are vapid, silly, and useless,—given chiefly to pleasure-seeking and a hankering after lovers; and she had resolved that she would not be such a one.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Industry, self-denial, and a religious purpose in life, were the tasks which she set herself; and she went about the performance of them with much courage. \u0026nbsp;But such tasks, though they are excellently well adapted to fit a young lady for the work of living, may also be carried too far, and thus have the effect of unfitting her for that work. \u0026nbsp;When Elizabeth Garrow made up her mind that the finding of a husband was not the only purpose of life, she did very well. \u0026nbsp;It is very well that a young lady should feel herself capable of going through the world happily without one. \u0026nbsp;But in teaching herself this she also taught herself to think that there was a certain merit in refusing herself the natural delight of a lover, even though the possession of the lover were compatible with all her duties to herself, her father and mother, and the world at large. \u0026nbsp;It was not that she had determined to have no lover. \u0026nbsp;She made no such resolve, and when the proper lover came he was admitted to her heart. \u0026nbsp;But she declared to herself unconsciously that she must put a guard upon herself, lest she should be betrayed into weakness by her own happiness. \u0026nbsp;She had resolved that in loving her lord she would not worship him, and that in giving her heart she would only so give it as it should be given to a human creature like herself. \u0026nbsp;She had acted on these high resolves, and hence it had come to pass,—not unnaturally,—that Mr. Godfrey Holmes had told her that it was “her fault.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She was a pretty, fair girl, with soft dark-brown hair, and soft long dark eyelashes. \u0026nbsp;Her grey eyes, though quiet in their tone, were tender and lustrous. \u0026nbsp;Her face was oval, and the lines of her cheek and chin perfect in their symmetry. \u0026nbsp;She was generally quiet in her demeanour, but when moved she could rouse herself to great energy, and speak with feeling and almost with fire. \u0026nbsp;Her fault was a reverence for martyrdom in general, and a feeling, of which she was unconscious, that it became a young woman to be unhappy in secret;—that it became a young woman, I might rather say, to have a source of unhappiness hidden from the world in general, and endured without any detriment to her outward cheerfulness. \u0026nbsp;We know the story of the Spartan boy who held the fox under his tunic. \u0026nbsp;The fox was biting into him,—into the very entrails; but the young hero spake never a word. \u0026nbsp;Now Bessy Garrow was inclined to think that it was a good thing to have a fox always biting, so that the torment caused no ruffling to her outward smiles. \u0026nbsp;Now at this moment the fox within her bosom was biting her sore enough, but she bore it without flinching.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If you would rather that he should not come I will have it arranged,” her mother had said to her.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Not for worlds,” she had answered. \u0026nbsp;“I should never think well of myself again.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Her mother had changed her own mind more than once as to the conduct in this matter which might be best for her to follow, thinking solely of her daughter’s welfare. \u0026nbsp;“If he comes they will be reconciled, and she will be happy,” had been her first idea. \u0026nbsp;But then there was a stern fixedness of purpose in Bessy’s words when she spoke of Mr. Holmes, which had expelled this hope, and Mrs. Garrow had for a while thought it better that the young man should not come. \u0026nbsp;But Bessy would not permit this. \u0026nbsp;It would vex her father, put out of course the arrangements of other people, and display weakness on her own part. \u0026nbsp;He should come, and she would endure without flinching while the fox gnawed at her.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That battle of the mistletoe had been fought on the morning before Christmas-day, and the Holmeses came on Christmas-eve. \u0026nbsp;Isabella was comparatively a stranger, and therefore received at first the greater share of attention. \u0026nbsp;She and Elizabeth had once seen each other, and for the last year or two had corresponded, but personally they had never been intimate. \u0026nbsp;Unfortunately for the latter, that story of Godfrey’s offer and acceptance had been communicated to Isabella, as had of course the immediately subsequent story of their separation. \u0026nbsp;But now it would be almost impossible to avoid the subject in conversation. \u0026nbsp;“Dearest Isabella, let it be as though it had never been,” she had said in one of her letters. \u0026nbsp;But sometimes it is very difficult to let things be as though they had never been.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The first evening passed over very well. \u0026nbsp;The two Coverdale girls were there, and there had been much talking and merry laughter, rather juvenile in its nature, but on the whole none the worse for that. \u0026nbsp;Isabella Holmes was a fine, tall, handsome girl; good-humoured, and well disposed to be pleased; rather Frenchified in her manners, and quite able to take care of herself. \u0026nbsp;But she was not above round games, and did not turn up her nose at the boys. \u0026nbsp;Godfrey behaved himself excellently, talking much to the Major, but by no means avoiding Miss Garrow. \u0026nbsp;Mrs. Garrow, though she had known him since he was a boy, had taken an aversion to him since he had quarrelled with her daughter; but there was no room on this first night for showing such aversion, and everything went off well.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Godfrey is very much improved,” the Major said to his wife that night.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do you think so?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Indeed I do. \u0026nbsp;He has filled out and become a fine man.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “In personal appearance, you mean. \u0026nbsp;Yes, he is well-looking enough.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And in his manner, too. \u0026nbsp;He is doing uncommonly well in Liverpool, I can tell you;

that had been distinctly promised to Patty Coverdale; but the dance would not commence till eight. \u0026nbsp;The beef and pudding were ponderous, but with due efforts they were overcome and disappeared. \u0026nbsp;The glass of port was sipped, the almonds and raisins were nibbled, and then the ladies left the room. \u0026nbsp;Ten minutes after that Elizabeth found herself seated with Isabella Holmes over the fire in her father’s little book-room. \u0026nbsp;It was not by her that this meeting was arranged, for she dreaded such a constrained confidence; but of course it could not be avoided, and perhaps it might be as well now as hereafter.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2898/80011.html","bookId":1120,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 1:03:17 PM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 1:03:17 PM"}
