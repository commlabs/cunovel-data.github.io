Someone I\u0027m working with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is it?\" she asks. \"Do I know them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s an actress,\" I say. \"Her name\u0027s Rain Turner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlair is silent. Whatever we had recovered earlier in the phone call is now gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s an actress,\" I repeat. \"Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlair doesn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blair?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, I thought maybe you\u0027d come solo, but I don\u0027t want her here,\" she says quickly. \"I would never have allowed her to come here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" I ask in a warning voice. \"Do you know her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, Clay - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, f**k this,\" I say. \"Why would you invite me anyway, Blair? What are you doing? Are you trying to f**k with me? Are you still pissed? It\u0027s been over two years, Blair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a pause, she says, \"I think we should talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pauses again. \"Meet me somewhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why can\u0027t we talk now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t talk over the phone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not, Blair?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because none of these lines are secure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning off Sunset onto Stone Canyon I drive into the darkness of the canyons and valet park the BMW at the Hotel Bel-Air. I walk across the bridge past the swans floating in the pond and make my way to the dining room but Blair\u0027s not there and when I ask the hostess I find out she didn\u0027t make a reservation and outside I look around the patio but she\u0027s not there either and I\u0027m about to call her when I realize I don\u0027t have her number. As I walk to the front desk I\u0027m suddenly aware of how much effort I made to look nice even though nothing was going to happen. The receptionist tells me what room Mrs. Burroughs is in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pace around the grounds debating something and then I give up and walk to the room and knock. When Blair opens the door I walk in past her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not going to happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s not going to happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This.\" I make a tired gesture with my arm across the suite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not why we\u0027re ... \" She looks away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlair\u0027s wearing loose cotton pants and she has no makeup on and her hair\u0027s pulled back and whatever work she has had done you can\u0027t tell and she\u0027s sitting on the edge of the bed next to a Michael Kors bag and she\u0027s not wearing her wedding ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just a suite that Trent keeps,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\" I say, pacing. \"Where\u0027s Trent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s still upset about Kelly Montrose,\" Blair says. \"They were close.

I don\u0027t even look at what bottle I take out. Annoyed, shaky, I pour myself a drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why wouldn\u0027t it happen?\" Blair asks. \"Is it because of her? The girl you wanted to bring to my house?\" She pauses. \"The actress?\" She pauses again. \"You don\u0027t think I\u0027d be upset about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want to talk about?\" I ask impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess in a way it\u0027s about Julian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?
