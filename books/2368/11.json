You can look down on Coit Tower from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched the young husband and wife step outside and walk over to the balustrade. The view from there was magnificent, the city of San Francisco spread out far below them in a spectacular panorama. Robert Crowther saw the couple exchange a glance and a secret smile, and he was amused. They were trying to bide their excitement. The pattern was always the same: Prospective buyers believed that if they showed too much enthusiasm, the price would go up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this duplex penthouse, Crowther thought wryly, the price is high enough already. He was concerned about whether the couple could afford it. The man was a lawyer, and young lawyers did not make that much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were an attractive couple, obviously very much in love. David Singer was in his early thirties, blond and intelligent-looking, with an engaging boyishness about him. His wife, Sandra, was lovely looking and warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert Crowther had noticed the bulge around her stomach and had said, \"The second guest room would be perfect for a nursery. There\u0027s a playground a block away and two schools in the neighborhood.\" He had watched them exchange that secret smile again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe duplex penthouse consisted of an upstairs master bedroom with a bath and a guest room. On the first floor was a spacious living room, a dining room, a library, a kitchen, a second guest bedroom and two bathrooms. Almost every room had a view of the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert watched the two of them as they walked through the apartment again. They stood in a corner whispering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love it,\" Sandra was saying to David. \"And it would be great for the baby. But, darling, can we afford it? It\u0027s six hundred thousand dollars!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plus maintenance,\" David added. \"The bad news is that we can\u0027t afford it today. The good news is that we\u0027re going to be able to afford it on Thursday. The genie is coming out of the magic bottle, and our lives are going to change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" she said happily. \"Isn\u0027t it wonderful!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should we go ahead with it?\" Sandra took a deep breath. \"Let\u0027s go for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid grinned, waved a hand and said, \"Welcome home. Miss. Singer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArm in arm, they walked over to where Robert Crowther was waiting. \"We\u0027ll take it,\" David told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Congratulations. It\u0027s one of the choicest residences in San Francisco. You\u0027re going to be very happy here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure we are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re lucky. I have to tell you, we have a few other people who are very interested in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much of a down payment will you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A deposit of ten thousand dollars now will be fine. I\u0027ll have the papers drawn up. When you sign, we\u0027ll require another sixty thousand dollars. Your bank can work out a schedule of monthly payments on a twenty-or thirty-year mortgage.\" David glanced at Sandra. \"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have the papers prepared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we look around once more?\" Sandra asked eagerly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrowther smiled benevolently. \"Take all the time you want, Mrs. Singer. It\u0027s yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It all seems like a wonderful dream, David. I can\u0027t believe it\u0027s really happening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s happening.\" David took her in his arms. \"I want to make all your dreams come true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do, darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had been living in a small, two-bedroom apartment in the Marina District, but with the baby coming, it was going to be crowded. Until now, they could never have afforded the duplex on Nob Hill, but Thursday was partnership day at the international law firm of Kincaid, Turner, Rose \u0026amp; Ripley, where David worked. Out of a possible twenty-five candidates, six would be chosen to enter the rarefied air of the firm\u0027s partnership, and everyone agreed that David was one of those who would be selected. Kincaid, Turner, Rose \u0026amp; Ripley, with offices in San Francisco, New York, London, Paris and Tokyo, was one of the most prestigious law firms in the world, and it was usually the number one target for graduates of all the top law schools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe firm used the stick-and-carrot approach on their young associates. The senior partners took merciless advantage of them, disregarding their hours and illnesses and handing the younger lawyers the donkey\u0027s work that they themselves did not want to be bothered with. It was a heavy pressure, twenty-four-hour-a-day job. That was the stick. Those who stayed on did so because of the carrot. The carrot was the promise of a partnership in the firm. Becoming a partner meant a larger salary, a piece of the huge corporate-profit pie, a spacious office with a view, a private washroom, assignments overseas and myriad other perks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid had practiced corporate law with Kincaid, Turner, Rose \u0026amp; Ripley for six years, and it had been a mixed blessing. The hours were horrific and the stress was enormous, but David, determined to hang in there for the partnership, had stayed and had done a brilliant job. Now the day was finally at hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen David and Sandra left the real estate agent, they went shopping. They bought a bassinet, highchair, stroller, playpen and clothes for the baby, whom they were already thinking of as Jeffrey. \"Let\u0027s get him some toys,\" David said. \"There\u0027s plenty of time for that.\" Sandra laughed. After shopping, they wandered around the city, walking along the waterfront at Ghirardelli Square, past the Cannery to Fisherman\u0027s Wharf. They had lunch at the American Bistro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Saturday, a perfect San Francisco day for monogrammed leather briefcases and power ties, dark suits and discreetly monogrammed shirts, a day for power lunches and penthouses. A lawyer\u0027s day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid and Sandra had met three years earlier at a small dinner party. David had gone to the party with the daughter of a client of the firm. Sandra was a paralegal, working for a rival firm. At dinner, Sandra and David had gotten into an argument about a decision that had been rendered in a political case in Washington. As the others at the dinner table watched, the argument between the two of them had become more and more heated. And in the middle of it, David and Sandra realized that neither of them cared about the court\u0027s decision. They were showing off for each other, engaged in a verbal mating dance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid telephoned Sandra the next day. \"I\u0027d like to finish discussing that decision,\" David said. \"I think it\u0027s important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do I,\" Sandra agreed. \"Could we talk about it at dinner tonight?\" Sandra hesitated. She had already made a dinner date for that evening. \"Yes,\" she said. \"Tonight will be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were together from that night on. One year from the day they met, they were married.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoseph Kincaid, the firm\u0027s senior partner, had given David the weekend off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid\u0027s salary at Kincaid, Turner, Rose \u0026amp; Ripley was $45,000 a year. Sandra kept her job as a paralegal. But now, with the baby coming, their expenses were about to go up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have to give up my job in a few months,\" Sandra said. \"I don\u0027t want a nanny bringing up our baby, darling. I want to be here for him.\" The sonogram had shown that the baby was a boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be able to handle it,\" David assured her. The partnership was going to transform their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid had begun to put in even longer hours. He wanted to make sure that he was not overlooked on partnership day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThursday morning, as David got dressed, he was watching the news on television.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn anchorman was saying breathlessly, \"We have a breaking story.... Ashley Patterson, the daughter of the prominent San Francisco doctor Steven Patterson, has been arrested as the suspected serial killer the police and the FBI have been searching for....\" David stood in front of the television set, frozen. \"... last night Santa Clara County Sheriff Matt Dowling announced Ashley Patterson\u0027s arrest for a series of murders that included bloody castrations. Sheriff Dowling told reporters, \u0027There\u0027s no doubt that we have the right person. The evidence is conclusive.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Steven Patterson. David\u0027s mind went back, remembering the past...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was twenty-one years old and just starting law school. He came home from class one day to find his mother on the bedroom floor, unconscious. He called 911, and an ambulance took his mother to San Francisco Memorial Hospital. David waited outside the emergency room until a doctor came to talk to him. \"Is she - Is she going to be all right?\" The doctor hesitated. \"We had one of our cardiologists examine her. She has a ruptured cord in her mitral valve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does that mean?\" David demanded. \"I\u0027m afraid there\u0027s nothing we can do for her. She\u0027s too weak to have a transplant, and mini heart surgery is new and too risky.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid felt suddenly faint \"How - how long can she - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d say a few more days, maybe a week. I\u0027m sorry, son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid stood there, panicky. \"Isn\u0027t there anyone who can help her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid not. The only one who might have been able to help is Steven Patterson, bat he\u0027s a very - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s Steven Patterson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Patterson pioneered minimally invasive heart surgery. But between his schedule and his research, there\u0027s no chance that - \" David was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe called Dr. Patterson\u0027s office from a pay phone in the hospital corridor. \"I\u0027d like to make an appointment with Dr. Patterson. It\u0027s for my mother. She - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. We\u0027re not accepting any new appointments. The first available time would be six months from now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She doesn\u0027t have six months,\" David shouted. \"I\u0027m sorry. I can refer you to - \" David slammed down the phone. The following morning David went to Dr. Patterson\u0027s office. The waiting room was crowded. David walked up to the receptionist. \"I\u0027d like to make an appointment to see Dr. Patterson. My mother\u0027s very ill and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at him and said, \"You called yesterday, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you then. We don\u0027t have any appointments open, and we\u0027re not making any just now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll wait,\" David said stubbornly. \"You can\u0027t wait. The doctor is - \" David took a seat. He watched the people in the waiting room being called into the inner office one by one until finally he was the only one left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt six o\u0027clock, the receptionist said, \"There\u0027s no point in waiting any longer. Dr. Patterson has gone home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid went to visit his mother in intensive care that evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can only stay a minute,\" a nurse warned him. \"She\u0027s very weak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid stepped inside the room, and his eyes filled with tears. His mother was attached to a respirator with tubes running into her arms and through her nose. She looked whiter than the sheets she lay on. Her eyes were closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid moved close to her and said, \"It\u0027s me, Mom. I\u0027m not going to let anything happen to you. You\u0027re going to be fine.\" Tears were running down his cheeks. \"Do you hear me? We\u0027re going to fight this thing. Nobody can lick the two of us, not as long as we\u0027re together. I\u0027m going to get you the best doctor in the world. You just hang in there. I\u0027ll be back tomorrow.\" He bent down and gently kissed her cheek. Will she be alive tomorrow?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following afternoon, David went to the garage in the basement of the building where Dr. Patterson had his offices. An attendant was parking cars. He came up to David. \"May I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m waiting for my wife,\" David said. \"She\u0027s seeing Dr. Patterson.\" The attendant smiled. \"He\u0027s a great guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was telling us about some fancy car that he owns.\" David paused, trying to remember. \"Was it a Cadillac?\" The attendant shook his head. \"No.\" He pointed to a Rolls-Royce parked in the corner. \"It\u0027s that Rolls over there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid said, \"Right. I think he said he has a Cadillac, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t surprise me,\" the attendant said. He hurried off to park an incoming car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid walked casually toward the Rolls. When he was sure no one was watching, he opened the door, slipped into the backseat and got down on the floor. He lay there, cramped and uncomfortable, willing Dr. Patterson to come out\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 6:15, David felt a slight jar as the front door of the car opened and someone moved into the driver\u0027s seat. He heard the engine start, and then the car began to move. \"Good night. Dr. Patterson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night, Marco.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car left the garage, and David felt it turn a corner. He waited for two minutes, then took a deep breath and sat up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Patterson saw him in the rearview mirror. He said calmly, \"If this is a holdup, I have no cash with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Turn onto a side street and pull over to the curb.\" Dr. Patterson nodded. David watched warily as the doctor turned the car onto a side street, pulled over to the curb and stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll give you what cash I have on me,\" Dr. Patterson said. \"You can take the car. There\u0027s no need for violence. If - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid had slid into the front seat. \"This isn\u0027t a holdup. I don\u0027t want the car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Patterson was looking at him with annoyance. \"What the hell do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Singer. My mother\u0027s dying. I want you to save her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a flicker of relief on Dr. Patterson\u0027s face, replaced by a look of anger. \"Make an appointment with my - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no time to make a goddamn appointment\" David was yelling. \"She\u0027s going to die, and I\u0027m not going to let that happen.\" He was fighting to control himself. \"Please. The other doctors told me you\u0027re the only hope we have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Patterson was watching him, still wary. \"What\u0027s her problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has a - a ruptured cord in her mitral valve. The doctors are afraid to operate. They say that you\u0027re the only one who can save her life.\" Dr. Patterson shook his head. \"My schedule - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t give a shit about your schedule! This is my mother. You\u0027ve got to save her! She\u0027s all have....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long silence. David sat there, his eyes tightly shut. He heard Dr. Patterson\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t promise a damn thing, but I\u0027ll see her. Where is she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid turned to look at him. \"She\u0027s in the intensive care unit at San Francisco Memorial Hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meet me there at eight o\u0027clock tomorrow morning.\" David had difficulty finding his voice. \"I don\u0027t know how to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember, I\u0027m not promising anything. And don\u0027t appreciate being scared out of my wits, young man. Next time, try the telephone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid sat there, rigid. Dr. Patterson looked at him. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s another problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - I don\u0027t have any money. I\u0027m a law student, and I\u0027m working my way through law school.\" Dr. Patterson was staring at him. David said passionately, \"I swear I\u0027ll find a way to pay you back. If it takes all my life, I\u0027ll see that you get paid know how expensive you are, and I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think you do, son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no one else to torn to, Dr. Patterson. I - I\u0027m begging you.\" There was another silence. \"How many years of law school have you had?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None. I\u0027m just starting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you expect to be able to pay me back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I swear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get the hell out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen David got home, he was certain he was going to be picked up by the police for kidnapping, threatening bodily harm, God only knew what. But nothing happened. The question in his mind was whether Dr. Patterson was going to show up at the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen David walked into the intensive care ward the next morning. Dr. Patterson was there, examining David\u0027s mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid watched, his heart pounding, his throat dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Patterson turned to one of a group of doctors standing there. \"Get her up to the operating room, Al. Stat!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they started to slide David\u0027s mother onto a gurney, David said hoarsely, \"Is she - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSix hours later, David was in the waiting room when Dr. Patterson approached him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid jumped to his feet. \"How is - ?\" He was afraid to finish the question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s going to be fine. Your mother\u0027s a strong lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid stood there, filled with an overpowering sense of relief. He breathed a silent prayer. Thank you, God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Patterson was watching him. \"I don\u0027t even know your first name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"David, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, David sir, do you know why decided to do this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two reasons. Your mother\u0027s condition was a challenge for me. I like challenges. The second reason was you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you did was the kind of thing I might have done myself when I was younger. You showed imagination. Now\" - his tone changed - \"you said you were going to repay me.\" David\u0027s heart sank. \"Yes, sir. One day - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about now?\" David swallowed. \"Now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll make you a deal. Do you know how to drive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. I get tired of driving that big car around. You drive me to work every morning and pick me up at six or seven o\u0027clock every evening for one year. At the end of that time, I\u0027ll consider my fee paid....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the deal. David drove Dr. Patterson to the office and back home every day, and in exchange. Dr. Patterson saved the life of David\u0027s mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring that year, David learned to revere Dr. Patterson. Despite the doctor\u0027s occasional outbursts of temper, he was the most selfless man David had ever known. He was heavily involved in charity work and donated his spare time to free clinics. Driving to and from the office or hospital, he and David had long talks. \"What kind of law are you studying, David?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Criminal law.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? So you can help the damn scoundrels get off scot-free?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir. There are a lot of honest people caught up in the law who need help want to help them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the year was up. Dr. Patterson shook David\u0027s hand and said, \"We\u0027re even....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid had not seen Steven Patterson in years, but he kept coming across his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Steven Patterson opened a free clinic for babies with AIDS....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Steven Patterson arrived in Kenya today to open the Patterson Medical Center....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Work on the Patterson Charity Shelter began today... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to be everywhere, donating his time and his money to those who needed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandra\u0027s voice shook David out of his reverie. \"David. Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned away from the television set \"They\u0027ve just arrested Steven Patterson\u0027s daughter for those serial killings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandra said, \"That\u0027s terrible! I\u0027m so sorry, darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He gave Mother seven more years of a wonderful life. It\u0027s unfair that anything like that should happen to a man like him. He\u0027s the greatest gentleman I\u0027ve ever known, Sandra. He doesn\u0027t deserve this. How could he have a monster like that for a daughter?\" He looked at his watch. \"Damn! I\u0027m going to be late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You haven\u0027t had breakfast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m too upset to eat.\" He glanced toward the television set. \"This... and today\u0027s partnership day....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to get it. There\u0027s no question about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s always a question about it, honey. Every year, someone who\u0027s supposed to be a shoo-in winds up in the loser\u0027s box.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bugged him and said, \"They\u0027ll be lucky to have you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned over and kissed her. \"Thanks, baby. I don\u0027t know what I\u0027d do without you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll never have to. You\u0027ll call me as soon as you get the news, won\u0027t you, David?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I will. We\u0027ll go out and celebrate.\" And the words reverberated in his mind. Years ago, he had said to someone else, \"We\u0027ll go out and celebrate. \" And he had lolled her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe offices of Kincaid, Turner, Rose \u0026amp; Ripley occupied three floors in the TransAmerica Pyramid in downtown San Francisco. When David Singer walked through the doors, he was greeted with knowing smiles. It seemed to him that there was even a different quality in the \"good mornings.\" They knew they were addressing a future partner in the firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the way to his small office, David passed the newly decorated office that would belong to one of the chosen partners, and he could not resist looking inside. It was a large, beautiful office with a private washroom, a desk and chairs facing a picture window with a magnificent view of the Bay. He stood there a moment, drinking it in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen David walked into his office, his secretary, Holly, said, \"Good morning, Mr. Singer.\" There was a lilt in her voice. \"Good morning, Holly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a message for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Kincaid would like to see you in his office at five o\u0027clock.\" She broke into a broad smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it was really happening. \"Great!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved closer to David and said, \"I think I should also tell you, I had coffee with Dorothy, Mr. Kincaid\u0027s secretary, this morning. She says you\u0027re at the top of the list.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid grinned. \"Thanks, Holly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like some coffee?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Love it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hot and strong, coming up.\" David walked over to his desk. It was heaped with briefs and contracts and files.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday was the day. Finally. \"Mr. Kincaid would like to see you in his office at five o\u0027clock.... You\u0027re at the top of the list.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was tempted to telephone Sandra with the news. Something held him back. I\u0027ll wait until it happens, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid spent the next two hours dealing with the material on his desk. At eleven o\u0027clock. Holly came in. \"There\u0027s a Dr. Patterson here to see you. He has no app - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up in surprise. \"Dr. Patterson is here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid rose. \"Send him in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteven Patterson came in, and David tried to conceal his reaction. The doctor looked old and tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, David.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Patterson. Please, sit down.\" David watched him slowly take a chair. \"I saw the news this morning. I - can\u0027t tell you how very sorry I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Patterson nodded wearily. \"Yes. It\u0027s been quite a blow.\" He looked up. \"I need your help, David.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" David said eagerly. \"Anything I can do. Anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to represent Ashley.\" It took a moment for the words to sink in. \"I - I can\u0027t do that I\u0027m not a criminal defense lawyer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Patterson looked him in the eye and said, \"Ashley\u0027s not a criminal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - You don\u0027t understand, Dr. Patterson. I\u0027m a corporate lawyer. I can recommend an excellent - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve already had calls from half a dozen top criminal defense lawyers. They all want to represent her.\" He leaned forward in his chair. \"But they\u0027re not interested in my daughter, David. This is a high-profile case, and they\u0027re looking for the limelight. They don\u0027t give a damn about her. I do. She\u0027s all I have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to save my mother\u0027s life. She\u0027s all I have.\" David said, \"I really want to help you, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you got out of law school, you went to work for a criminal law firm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid\u0027s heart began to beat faster. \u0027 \"That\u0027s true, but - \" \"You were a criminal defense lawyer for several years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid nodded. \"Yes, but I - I gave it up. That was a long time ago and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that long ago, David. And you told me how much you loved it. Why did you quit and go into corporate law?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid sat there, silent for a moment. \"It\u0027s not important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Patterson took out a handwritten letter and banded it to David. David knew what it said, without reading it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear Dr. Patterson,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are no words that can ever express bow much I owe you and how much I appreciate your great generosity. If there\u0027s ever anything at all that I can do for you, all you have to do is ask me, and it shall be done without question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid stared at the letter without seeing it. \"David, will you talk to Ashley?\" David nodded. \"Yes, of course I\u0027ll talk to her, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Patterson rose. \"Thank you.\" David watched him walk out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you quit and go into corporate law?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I made a mistake, and an innocent woman I loved is dead. I swore I would never take anyone\u0027s life in my hands again. Ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t defend Ashley Patterson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid pressed down the intercom button. \"Holly, would you ask Mr. Kincaid if he can see me now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty minutes later, David was walking into the elaborate offices of Joseph Kincaid. Kincaid was in his sixties, a gray monochrome of a man, physically, mentally and emotionally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" he said as David walked in the door, \"you\u0027re an anxious young fellow, aren\u0027t you? Our meeting wasn\u0027t supposed to be until five o\u0027clock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid approached the desk. \"I know. I came here to discuss something else, Joseph.\" Years ago, David had made the mistake of calling him Joe, and the old man had had a fit. \"Don\u0027t you ever call me Joe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down, David.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid took a seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cigar? They\u0027re from Cuba.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s on your mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Steven Patterson was just in to see me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKincaid said, \"He was on the news this morning. Damned shame. What did he want with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He asked me to defend his daughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKincaid looked at David, surprised. \"You\u0027re not a criminal defense lawyer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told him that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then.\" Kincaid was thoughtful for a moment \"You know. I\u0027d like to get Dr. Patterson as a client. He\u0027s very influential. He could bring a lot of business to this firm. He has connections with several medical organizations that - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKincaid looked at David, quizzically. \"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I promised him I\u0027d talk to his daughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see. Well, I suppose there\u0027s no harm in that. Talk to her, and then we\u0027ll find a good defense attorney to represent her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my plan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. We\u0027ll be building up some points with him. You go ahead.\" He smiled. \"I\u0027ll see you at five o\u0027clock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. Thank you, Joseph.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs David walked back to his office, he wondered to himself. Why in the world would Dr. Patterson insist on having me represent his daughter? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tell-me-your-dreams/page-11.html","bookId":2368,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:53 AM"}
