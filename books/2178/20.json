By the glow coming from Drust\u0027s hands I can see more of Brude from here-more than I want to. Almost all the bits inside him-the bits of a person which are supposed to remain hidden-are obscenely revealed, pulsing, bubbling and gurgling within the transformed layers of rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrude screams at us as we invade the tunnel of his body, his voice only just audible above the bellowing and mewling of the demons. He curses us, threatens a violent end, warns us to turn back. When that fails, he tries to win us over with promises of power, long lives and protection from the Demonata.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe ignore him and proceed, Drust chanting words of powerful magic, me following obediently, awaiting his command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrude\u0027s voice fades as we move down the tunnel until it\u0027s nothing more than a low murmur. The walls around us change too, hardening, becoming more like real rock, although with small lines running through them-I think they\u0027re veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI expect Drust to stop, complete his spells and make the sacrifice. But he keeps moving, slow but sure, following the path of the tunnel as it curves and dips ever lower. I want to ask why he doesn\u0027t end it here, so he can get out quickly if successful, before the walls close around him. But I dare not interrupt while he\u0027s casting the spells, for fear I\u0027d break his concentration, shatter the web of magic and free the demons to hurtle down the tunnel after us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually, the tunnel leads us to another cave. This one\u0027s smaller than the first, with none of the spectacular formations. Most of the floor is covered by a pool of water. An island of bones juts out of the middle of the pool. In the centre stands a large rectangular stone which reminds me of the ring of Old stones where we sought shelter from the demons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrust stands by the edge of the water, observing the stone, for several minutes, muttering more spells. Then he stops and looks at me, smiling tiredly. \"A lodestone,\" he says. \"A reservoir of ancient magic. Very powerful. We think the Old Creatures used stones like this to mark the position of our world, so they could find their way here from the stars. The Old Creatures have drained most of the remaining lodestones of their power, but they either missed this one or deliberately left it charged for one reason or another. Brude found it and used it to open the tunnel. We\u0027ll turn it against him now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it safe for you to stop?\" I ask nervously, glancing back up the tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For a moment,\" Drust says. \"The spells I\u0027ve cast are at work on the walls of the rock, Brude, the...\" He nods towards a point beyond the island. Staring hard, I see the mouth of a second tunnel in the rock on the far side of the pool-but the walls of this tunnel are made of red webs and strips of flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the tunnel to the Demonata\u0027s world?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye. On their side a demon master has undergone a transformation like Brude, creating that tunnel. The lodestone links the pair. It\u0027s been absorbing magic from Brude and the demon master, uniting their forms, slowly knitting together the fabric of the two tunnels. The lesser demons have been able to squeeze through during the process. When the tunnels become one, the masters will be able to follow their servants to our world. If that happens, mankind is finished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if a demon comes through when you\u0027re casting the rest of your spells?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrust pauses. \"I won\u0027t be able to stop. You\u0027ll have to fight it.\" He runs an eye over me. \"Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" I lick my lips, mouth dry from the heat of the tunnel and cave. \"Goll and Lorcan are dead. Connla too. I removed his protective spell. The demons killed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" Drust grunts. \"And Bran?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. He was alive when we entered the tunnel, but there were so many demons...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I make it back, I\u0027ll look for the boy,\" Drust promises. \"If he\u0027s alive, I\u0027ll take care of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe straightens, casts his tiredness off and steps into the water, starting on the next set of spells. I stare at the island of bones for a second-impossible to tell if they\u0027re human or demon, or a mix of the two-then step in after him. Despite the heat of the cave, the water\u0027s cold, but not as cold as the sea was. No need for a warming spell. I wade after Drust, eyes on the lodestone and bones, morbidly wondering if he\u0027ll leave my bones there, on top of the pile, when he\u0027s done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe water\u0027s shallow, no higher than my lower thigh. It doesn\u0027t take us long to reach the island. When we\u0027re there, Drust climbs up on to the mound of bones. The bones are brittle and many snap under his feet. He takes no notice, continues with the spells, clambering his way over to the lodestone, beckoning me to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glow in Drust\u0027s hands has changed from blue to a pinkish red. The bones-especially the skulls-look as though they\u0027re aflame. I try to keep my eyes off them as I crawl to where Drust is kneeling, hands stretched out on either side of the lodestone, ready to clasp it when the moment\u0027s right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Drust casts spells, I move slightly to one side of him, so I have a clear view of the tunnel to the Demonata\u0027s universe-I want plenty of warning if a demon comes through. But the monsters on the other side don\u0027t seem to be aware of the threat, or else they can\u0027t cross quickly. Nothing stirs. No shadows or sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find myself thinking about the bones and lodestone. Who set them here? The stone was put in place by the Old Creatures, but did Brude stick the bones underneath it? Have they been left by demons? Or are they the work of the Old Creatures too? Did they sacrifice people to create this place of magic, as Drust plans to sacrifice me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite my unease, I can\u0027t help studying the skulls, wondering if these people were killed on the surface or if they died down here. Were they volunteers? What were they thinking in their final moments? Did they go bravely to their deaths, as I hope to, or did they crumble at the end and scream for mercy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrust\u0027s voice rises, disturbing my thoughts. His hands close upon the lodestone, drawing gradually closer as he slips deeper inside the intricate web of spells. I listen to his words, and though they\u0027re hard to decipher-he\u0027s speaking so quickly!-after a while I catch a few of them. He\u0027s on one of the final spells. It won\u0027t be much longer. If I want to offer up any last prayers for myself, I\u0027d better do so now, before-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrust cries out. His hands fly wide apart, then dart to the small of his back. My eyes shoot down and I spot a dagger sticking out of his flesh, handle quivering, buried to the hilt. I whirl, summoning magic, expecting Connla or a demon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it\u0027s neither.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s Bran!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy stands at the edge of the pool, arm extended-he threw the knife. His face is curiously blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart leaps. Has Bran\u0027s innocence been an act all along? A spy in our midst, playing us for fools, waiting for the ultimate moment to strike? Impossible! Nobody could have been that convincing an actor. But there he stands, hand outstretched, dagger buried in Drust\u0027s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrust topples aside and sees Bran. He yells with astonishment, then groans with pain. I falter. I want to unleash a spell, drive the boy-the killer-back, destroy him if I can. But it\u0027s Bran! I can\u0027t hurt him, not until I\u0027m sure, not unless-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Drust gasps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBran blinks. He frowns at Drust, then looks at me-and bursts into tears. \"Flower!\" he cries. Starting forward, he wades sluggishly through the water, arms flailing, displaying none of his customary lightness of movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bec!\" Drust croaks. \"Stop him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I sigh, letting the spell die on my lips, understanding by his tears what has happened. \"It\u0027s all right. He won\u0027t do any more damage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBran makes it to the island of bones, wailing and sobbing. He throws himself at me, yelling \"Flower!\" again and again. I catch him, let him bury his face in my chest, and hold him as he weeps, stroking the back of his head, murmuring quieting words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few seconds I look over his head at the wounded druid. \"He heard us on the cliff,\" I whisper. \"He knew you planned to kill me. He couldn\u0027t let that happen. In his own crazy way he loves me. He hasn\u0027t done this to sabotage your plans-he did it to save me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrust grits his teeth with desperate anger. \"The idiot! Doesn\u0027t he know what will happen if-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I interrupt calmly. \"He doesn\u0027t. I\u0027m his friend, maybe the one person in the world he feels close to. He only knew that he didn\u0027t want me to die. Don\u0027t blame him. He couldn\u0027t control himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrust\u0027s expression softens. \"Aye,\" he chuckles. \"I think you\u0027re right. It\u0027s not much comfort to us, but...\" His eyes flick to the lodestone. He reaches for it, then winces and remains lying on his side. \"I can\u0027t do it, Bec.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI go cold. \"You must!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head. \"It\u0027s not too late-the spells will work if resumed quickly-but Bran has wounded me deeply. I haven\u0027t the strength to continue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must!\" I shout again. \"You have to try! Don\u0027t just lie there and give up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not talking about giving up,\" he smiles sadly. \"I can\u0027t complete the spells-but you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And sacrifice Bran?\" I ask quietly, dreading the answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you fool,\" the druid snaps, more like the Drust of old. \"Why kill two when one\u0027s already half dead? I\u0027m finished. Even if I could cast the rest of the spells, I\u0027d never make my way back to the surface. You need to take over, complete the spells, then slit my throat and let my blood flow over the lodestone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at him stupidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no time for gawping,\" he growls. \"I\u0027ll last a few more minutes with luck, but not much longer. Do it, Bec. Say the spells. Kill me. Spare your people the wrath of the Demonata. Then save yourself and Bran.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat final word jars me into action. Bran\u0027s risked all to rescue me. I can\u0027t repay him by stranding him here, to perish at the hands of the demon masters when they come. Unwrapping his arms from around my shivering frame, I push him back, smile to show everything\u0027s all right, then shuffle up beside Drust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do I have to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know where I stopped?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must,\" he insists. \"You have a perfect memory. Cast your thoughts back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s not easy but I force myself to focus. I pick at the strings of my always reliable memory with nimble fingers. Recall the spell Drust was chanting, the place where Bran interrupted him. \"Got it,\" I mutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Continue from there,\" the dying druid says. \"Spread your arms. Embrace the lodestone as you finish, then launch into the next spell. It should be a clear run from there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the sacrifice?\" I ask. \"When...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll know,\" he vows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne deep breath. A quick glance at the tunnel to the Demonata\u0027s universe to make sure nothing\u0027s barging towards us. I begin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words come easily. There\u0027s great power in this cave. I sensed it as soon as I came here- even before, when I was on the surface-but it\u0027s only when I open myself up to the magic that I feel the full extent of it. This stone has been filled with some of the most potent magical power imaginable. I believe I could do anything I set my mind to if I tapped into the lodestone long enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finish the spell, then grab the stone with both hands. I mean to start the next spell immediately, but the rush of power from the lodestone catches me by surprise and the words stick in my throat. It\u0027s incredible, as if all the magic of the stars was rushing into me. I can see the universe, the entire night sky. I could reach out if I wanted, leave this world, go and explore the stars with the Old Creatures. This land suddenly seems insignificant, hardly worth bothering about. With this much power I could create my own worlds and people to inhabit them. Not a priestess, not a queen-a goddess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFate whispers to me. Asks me to accept a new destiny, travel a fresh path, blaze a godly trail. I don\u0027t ever have to know fear again, pain, want. I don\u0027t even have to die. All I need is to reach out and...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rainbow,\" Bran whispers, touching my left forearm, gazing at me seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel the power rush into Bran through my flesh, then out of him again. It\u0027s not that he can\u0027t hold it-he just doesn\u0027t want it. The promise of the stars doesn\u0027t interest the boy. He cares only for me. If he could express himself with words, I think he\u0027d say something like, \"All the power in the universe means nothing if you can\u0027t be with the one you love.\" And he\u0027s right. What\u0027s the point of becoming a goddess if it costs the lives of all those I care about? I don\u0027t want a world of worshipful slaves, just a village of welcoming friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile at Bran, nodding slowly. He smiles back and releases my arm. I focus, close my eyes, shut out the seductive temptation of the stars and cast the next spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wind develops as I progress, a hot, biting, swirling wind. It gusts in a circle around the island of bones, gathering speed and power. Drust and Bran huddle up to the lodestone, not touching it, but wriggling in as close as they can, sheltering from the unearthly wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScreams. At first I think it\u0027s the sound of the wind. Then I realise they\u0027re coming from the tunnel which links this cave to the realm of the demons. The Demonata know what\u0027s happening. They can sense their gateway to this world collapsing. But all they can do in response is shriek hatefully at the herald of their ill fortune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spells race off my tongue. I\u0027m barely aware of what I\u0027m saying. I was foolish to worry about making a mistake. The spells are almost chanting themselves. I don\u0027t think I could stop even I wanted. I\u0027m not in control now. The magic is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI draw to the end of another spell, lick my lips, open them wide to start on the next... and stop. It\u0027s time. Only one spell left. And that comes after the sacrifice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrust knows too. He hauls himself up without having to be told. Smiles crookedly at me. \"Live long, Bec. Live well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t answer. I can\u0027t. My next words can only be words of magic. I can\u0027t break the sequence of spells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrust limps around to the other side of the lodestone. He leans forward, so his chin is directly over the rock. Then he tilts his head back, offering his throat. I let go of the lodestone with my right hand and press the nail of my index finger to the flesh of his throat. I smile at him, a tear trickling from my left eye. Then I swipe the magically hardened and sharpened nail across.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood gushes. The lodestone is soaked. It absorbs, then thirstily gulps the blood. Drust trembles but doesn\u0027t fall away. I can\u0027t see his eyes, only his throat. I\u0027m glad of that. He remains upright, feeding his blood to the stone, held up by magic or sheer willpower-I\u0027m not sure which.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, as the stone flashes with a blinding yellow light, Drust slumps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo time to grieve. With a bellow of triumph, I roar the words of the final spell. The lodestone quivers. The cave shakes. The wind howls to a climax, ripping the outer layers of bones off the island, threatening to pick loose Bran and me and dash us to death against the walls. But before it can...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind roars up the tunnel-Brude\u0027s tunnel-increasing in strength as it tears through the druid\u0027s form. It fills the cave beyond, then explodes up the shaft and billows outwards at an unnatural speed, in all directions, scraping every demon and undead spirit free of the earth. It\u0027s like a giant wave, washing away all things demonic in its path, carrying them tumbling and screaming to the very edge of the land, not stopping until it reaches the sea, where it pauses for one long, dreadful moment... then sweeps back, drawn to its source, this point. After that it will drag its demonic prisoners back to their own world and crudely dump them there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t wait for that. Magic has brought understanding. I know that when the last of the demons has been blown back to its own land by the final gust of wind, Brude\u0027s rock-infused bones will follow, then the tunnel will close, the rip between worlds will heal-and anyone still here will be crushed by rock or trapped underground to die slowly and horribly in the darkness. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bec-the-demonata-4/page-20.html","bookId":2178,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:45:42 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:45:42 PM"}
