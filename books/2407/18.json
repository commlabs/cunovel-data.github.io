I just want to see his face. Just once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now the man was to the far left of our camera, and even though he was no longer turned away, we could see only his left ear and cheekbone. He walked quickly. Soon he would be gone from our view, beneath the ceiling overhang at the far end of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, shit. This angle\u0027s no good. Let\u0027s look at another tape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a minute,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur man was moving toward a dark passageway that must lead to the staircase. But as he went, he passed a decorative gilt-frame mirror hanging on the wall, right by the passage. He passed it just as he went under the overhang, into final darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you stop this thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was pressing buttons on the player frantically. I finally found the one that stopped it. We went back. Then forward again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, the man moved purposefully toward the dark passage, with long, quick strides. He moved past the mirror, and for an instant - a single video frame - we could see his face reflected in the mirror - see it clearly - and I pressed the button to freeze the frame -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bingo,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A fucking Jap,\" Graham said. \"Just like I told you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrozen in the mirror was the face of the killer as he strode toward the stairwell. I had no trouble recognizing the tense features of Eddie Sakamura.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This one is mine,\" Graham said. \"It\u0027s my case. I\u0027m going to go bring the bastard in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" Connor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean,\" Graham said, \"I\u0027d rather go alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Connor said. \"It\u0027s your case, Tom. Do whatever you think best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor wrote down Eddie Sakamura\u0027s address for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not that I don\u0027t appreciate your help,\" Graham said. \"But I\u0027d rather handle it myself. Now, just so I have my facts straight: you guys talked to this guy earlier tonight, and you didn\u0027t bring him in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, don\u0027t worry about it,\" Graham said. \"I\u0027ll bury that in the report. It won\u0027t come back to you, I promise you.\" Graham was in a magnanimous mood, pleased at the prospect of arresting Sakamura. He glanced at his watch. \"Fucking A. Less than six hours since the original call, and we already have the murderer. Not bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t have the murderer quite yet,\" Connor said. \"I\u0027d bring him in right away, if I were you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m leaving now,\" Graham said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, and Tom,\" Connor said, as Graham headed toward the door. \"Eddie Sakamura is a strange guy, but he\u0027s not known to be violent. I doubt very much that he\u0027s armed. He probably doesn\u0027t even own a gun. He went home from the party with a redhead. He\u0027s probably in bed with her now. I think it would be advisable to bring him in alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" Graham said. \"What is it with you two?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a suggestion,\" Connor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really think I\u0027m going to shoot this little shithead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll go out there with a couple of black and whites for backup, won\u0027t you?\" Connor said. \"The patrolmen might be excitable. I\u0027m just giving you the background.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey. Thanks for your fucking support,\" Graham said, and he left. He was so broad, he had to turn slightly sideways to go through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched him go. \"Why are you letting him do this alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor shrugged. \"It\u0027s his case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027ve been aggressive all night in pursuing his case. Why stop now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor said. \"Let Graham have the glory. After all, what has it got to do with us? I\u0027m a cop on extended leave. And you\u0027re just a corrupt liaison officer.\" He pointed to the videotape. \"You want to run that for me, before you give me a ride home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\" I rewound the tape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was thinking we could get a cup of coffee, too,\" Connor said. \"They make a good one in the SID labs. At least, they used to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"You want me to get coffee while you look at the tape?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be nice, kōhai,\" Connor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\" I started the tape for him, and turned to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, and kōhai. While you\u0027re down there, ask the night duty officer what facilities the department has for videotapes. Because all these need to be duplicated. And we may need hard copies of individual frames. Especially if there\u0027s trouble about Sakamura\u0027s arrest as Japan-bashing by the department. We may need to release a picture. To defend ourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a good point. \"Okay,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll check.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I take mine black with one sugar.\" He turned to look at the monitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scientific investigation division, or SID, was in the basement of Parker Center. It was after two in the morning when I got there, and most of the sections were closed down. SID was pretty much a nine-to-five operation. Of course, the teams worked at night collecting evidence from crime scenes, but the evidence was then stored in lockers, either downtown or at one of the divisions, until the next morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to the coffee machine, in the little cafeteria next to Latent Prints. All around the room were signs reading:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDID YOU WASH YOUR HANDS? THIS MEANS YOU\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDON\u0027T EXPOSE FELLOW OFFICERS TO RISK. WASH YOUR HANDS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reason was that the SID teams used poisons, especially Criminalistics. There was so much mercury, arsenic, and chromium floating around that in the old days, officers had sometimes gotten sick by drinking from a Styrofoam cup that another lab worker had merely touched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut these days people were more careful; I got two cups of coffee and went back to the night-duty desk. Jackie Levine was on duty, with her feet up on the desk. She was a heavyset woman wearing toreador pants and an orange wig. Despite her bizarre appearance, she was widely acknowledged to be the best print lifter in the department. She was reading Modern Bride magazine. I said, \"You going to do it again, Jackie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, no,\" she said. \"My daughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s she marrying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s talk about something happy,\" she said. \"One of those coffees for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" I said. \"But I have a question for you. Who handles videotape evidence here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Videotape evidence?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like tape from surveillance cameras. Who analyzes it, makes hard copies, all that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we don\u0027t get much call for that,\" Jackie said. \"Electronics used to do it here, but I think they gave it up. Nowadays, video either goes to Valley or Medlar Hall.\" She sat forward, thumbed through a directory. \"If you want, you can talk to Bill Harrelson over at Medlar. But if it\u0027s anything special, I think we farm it out to JPL or the Advanced Imaging Lab at U.S.C. You want the contact numbers, or you want to go through Harrelson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething in her tone told me what to do. \"Maybe I\u0027ll take the contact numbers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrote the numbers down and went back up to the division. Connor had finished the tape and was running it back and forth at the point where Sakamura\u0027s face appeared in the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s Eddie, all right.\" He appeared calm, almost indifferent. He took the coffee from me and sipped it. \"Terrible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It used to be better.\" Connor set the cup aside, turned off the video recorder, stood, and stretched. \"Well, I think we\u0027ve done a good evening\u0027s work. What do you say we get some sleep? I have a big golf game in the morning at Sunset Hills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said. I packed the tapes back in the cardboard box, and set the VCR carefully in the box, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor said, \"What\u0027re you going to do with those tapes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll put \u0027em in the evidence locker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor said, \"These are the originals. And we don\u0027t have duplicates.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, but I can\u0027t get dupes made until tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly my point. Why don\u0027t you keep them with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take them home?\" There were all sorts of departmental injunctions about taking evidence home. It was against the rules, to put it mildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"I wouldn\u0027t leave this to chance. Take the tapes with you, and then you can arrange the duplication yourself, tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stuck them under my arm. I said, \"You don\u0027t think anybody at the department would - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not,\" Connor said. \"But this evidence is crucial and we wouldn\u0027t want anybody to walk by the evidence locker with a big magnet while we were asleep, would we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo in the end I took the tapes. As we went out the door, we passed Ishiguro, still sitting there, contrite. Connor said something quickly to him in Japanese. Ishiguro jumped to his feet, bowed quickly, and scurried out of the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he really so scared?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Connor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIshiguro moved quickly down the hall ahead of us, head bent low. He seemed almost a caricature of a mousy, frightened man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I said. \"He\u0027s lived here long enough to know that any case we might have against him for withholding evidence is not strong. And we have even less of a case against Nakamoto.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not the point,\" Connor said. \"He\u0027s not worried about legalities. He\u0027s worried about scandal. Because that\u0027s what would happen if we were in Japan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe came around the corner. Ishiguro was standing by the banks of elevators, waiting. We waited, too. There was an awkward moment. The first elevator came, and Ishiguro stepped away for us to get on. The doors closed on him bowing to us in the lobby. The elevator started down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor said, \"In Japan, he and his company could be finished forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because in Japan, scandal is the most common way of revising the pecking order. Of getting rid of a powerful opponent. It\u0027s a routine procedure over there. You uncover a vulnerability, and you leak it to the press, or to government investigators. A scandal inevitably follows, and the person or organization is ruined. That\u0027s how the Recruit scandal brought down Takeshita as prime minister. Or the financial scandals brought down Prime Minister Tanaka in the seventies. It\u0027s the same way the Japanese screwed General Electric a couple of years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They screwed General Electric?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the Yokogawa scandal. You heard of it? No? Well, it\u0027s classic Japanese maneuvering. A few years ago, General Electric made the best scanning equipment in the world for hospitals. GE formed a subsidiary, Yokogawa Medical, to market this equipment in Japan. And GE did business the Japanese way: cutting costs below competitors to get market share, providing excellent service and support, entertaining customers - giving potential buyers air tickets and traveler\u0027s checks. We\u0027d call it bribes, but it\u0027s standard business procedure in Japan. Yokogawa quickly became the market leader, ahead of Japanese companies like Toshiba. The Japanese companies didn\u0027t like that and complained about unfairness. And one day government agents raided Yokogawa\u0027s offices and found evidence of the bribes. They arrested several Yokogawa employees, and blackened the company name in scandal. It didn\u0027t hurt GE sales in Japan very much. It didn\u0027t matter that other Japanese companies also offer bribes. For some reason, it was the non-Japanese company that got caught. Amazing, how that happens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Is it really that bad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Japanese can be tough,\" Connor said. \"They say \u0027business is war,\u0027 and they mean it. You know how Japan is always telling us that their markets are open. Well, in the old days, if a Japanese bought an American car, he got audited by the government. So pretty soon, nobody bought an American car. The officials shrug: what can they do? Their market is open: they can\u0027t help it if nobody wants an American car. The obstructions are endless. Every imported car has to be individually tested on the dock to make sure it complies with exhaust-emission laws. Foreign drugs can only be tested in Japanese laboratories on Japanese nationals. Foreign skis were once banned because Japanese snow was said to be wetter than European and American snow. That\u0027s the way they treat other countries, so it\u0027s not surprising they worry about getting a taste of their own medicine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then Ishiguro is waiting for some scandal? Because that\u0027s what would happen in Japan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. He\u0027s afraid that Nakamoto will be finished in a single stroke. But I doubt that it will. Chances are, it\u0027ll be business as usual in Los Angeles tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove Connor back to his apartment. As he climbed out of the car I said, \"Well, it\u0027s been interesting, Captain. Thanks for spending the time with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re welcome,\" Connor said. \"Call me any time, if you need help in the future.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope your golf game isn\u0027t too early tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, it\u0027s at seven, but at my age I don\u0027t need much sleep. I\u0027ll be playing at the Sunset Hills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it a Japanese course?\" The purchase of the Sunset Hills Country Club was one of the more recent outrages in L.A. The West Los Angeles golf course was bought for a huge cash price: two hundred million dollars in 1990. At the time, the new Japanese owners said no changes would be made. But now, the American membership was slowly being reduced by a simple procedure: whenever an American retired, his place was offered to a Japanese. Sunset Hills memberships were sold in Tokyo for a million dollars each, where they were considered a bargain; there was a long waiting list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Connor said, \"I\u0027m playing with some Japanese.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do that often?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Japanese are avid golfers, as you know. I try to play twice a week. Sometimes you hear things of interest. Good night, kōhai.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night, Captain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was pulling onto the Santa Monica freeway when the phone rang. It was the DHD operator. \"Lieutenant, we have a Special Services call. Officers in the field request assistance of the liaison.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"Okay.\" She gave me the mobile number. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rising-sun/page-18.html","bookId":2407,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:45 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:45 AM"}
