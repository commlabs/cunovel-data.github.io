{"id":79584,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"\u003cp\u003eIT WAS an age of deceit. Everyone was suspicious of everyone else - and with good reason! You never knew when a trusted ally would turn, bare his fangs and rip you to pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampires and vampaneze were at war the War of the Scars - and the result hinged upon finding and killing the Lord of the Vampaneze. If the vampires did that, victory would be theirs. Otherwise, the night would belong to their purple-skinned blood-cousins, who would drive the vampires to extinction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree vampires were sent by Mr Desmond Tiny to hunt the Vampaneze Lord - Vancha March, Larten Crepsley and me, Darren Shan. I\u0027m a half-vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Tiny told us that other vampires couldn\u0027t assist us in our hunt, but non-vampires could. Thus, the only one to accompany us was a Little Person called Harkat Mulds, though a witch known as Lady Evanna also travelled with us for a short time during our quest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter unwittingly letting the Vampaneze Lord slip through our fingers in the first of four predicted encounters, we travelled to the city of Mr Crepsley\u0027s birth. We didn\u0027t expect to find the Lord of the Vampaneze there - we came to track down and stop a gang of vampaneze who were murdering humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe attracted two more companions in the city - my ex-girlfriend, Debbie Hemlock, and Steve Leopard. Steve used to be my best friend. He said he\u0027d become a vampaneze-hunter, and swore he\u0027d help us put an end to the killer vampaneze. Mr Crepsley was suspicious of Steve - he believed Steve had evil blood - but I persuaded him to grant my old friend the benefit of the doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur target was an insane, hook-handed vampaneze. It turned out he was another of my ex-associates - R.V. , which originally stood for Reggie Veggie, though he now claimed it was short for Righteous Vampaneze. He was once an eco-warrior, until his hands had been bitten off by the Wolf Man at the Cirque Du Freak. He blamed me for the accident, and had teamed up with the vampaneze in order to exact revenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe could have killed R.V. , but we knew he was in league with other vampaneze, and we chose instead to trick him into leading us to them. What we didn\u0027t know was that we were actually the flies in the trap, not the spiders. Deep beneath the streets of the city, dozens of vampaneze were waiting for us. Among them stood the Lord of the Vampaneze and his protector, Gannen Harst - Vancha March\u0027s estranged brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an underground cavern, Steve Leopard revealed his true colours. He was a half-vampaneze and had plotted with R.V. and the Vampaneze Lord to lure us to our doom. But Steve underestimated us, and I overcame him and would have killed him - except R.V. captured Debbie and threatened to murder her in retaliation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile this was happening, my allies pursued the Vampaneze Lord, but the odds were stacked against them and he escaped. The vampaneze could have slaughtered us all, but we would have killed many of them in the process. To avoid the bloodshed, Gannen Harst let us go and gave us a fifteen-minute head start - it would be easier for the vampaneze to kill us in the tunnels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith me holding Steve Leopard hostage, and Vancha clutching a vampet - a human who\u0027d been trained in the ways of the vampaneze - we retreated, leaving R.V. free to do all the terrible things he wanted to Debbie. Through the tunnels we hurried, exhausted and distraught, knowing the vampaneze would soon swarm after us and cut us down dead if they caught up ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter ONE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWE SCURRIED through the tunnels, Mr Crepsley leading the way, Vancha and I in the middle with our prisoners, Harkat bringing up the rear. We said as little as possible, and I cuffed Steve into silence whenever he started to speak - I wasn\u0027t in the mood to listen to his threats or insults.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t have a watch, but I\u0027d been ticking off the seconds inside my head. About ten minutes or so had passed by my reckoning. We\u0027d moved out of the modern tunnels and were back in the warren of old, damp tunnels. There was still a long way to go - plenty of time for the vampaneze to run us down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe came to a junction and Mr Crepsley took the left turn. Vancha started to follow him, then stopped. \"Larten,\" he called him back. When Mr Crepsley returned, Vancha crouched low. He was almost invisible in the darkness of the tunnels. \"We have to try and shake them off,\" he said. \"If we make straight for the surface, they\u0027ll be upon us before we\u0027re halfway there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we could lose ourselves if we detour,\" Mr Crepsley said. \"We do not know this area. We might run into a dead end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye,\" Vancha sighed, \"but it\u0027s a chance we\u0027ll have to take. I\u0027ll act as a decoy and go back the way we came. The rest of you try and find an alternative route out. I\u0027ll work my way back to you later, if the luck of the vampires is with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Crepsley thought about that a moment, then nodded quickly. \"Luck, Sire,\" he said, but Vancha was already gone, disappearing into the gloom in an instant, moving with the almost perfect silence of the vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe rested a moment, then took the right tunnel and pressed on, Harkat now in charge of the vampet Vancha had kidnapped. We moved quickly but carefully, trying not to leave any signs that we\u0027d passed this way. At the end of the tunnel, we branched off, again to the right. As we entered a fresh stretch of tunnel, Steve coughed loudly. Mr Crepsley was on him in a flash. \"Do that again and you die!\" he snapped, and I sensed the blade of his knife pressing against Steve\u0027s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a real cough - not a signal,\" Steve snarled in reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It matters not!\" Mr Crepsley hissed. \"The next time, I will kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteve was silent after that, as was the vampet. We marched steadily upwards, instinctively navigating the tunnels, wading through water and waste. I felt terrible, tired and drawn, but I didn\u0027t slow down. It must be daylight above ground, or very close to it. Our only hope was to get clear of the tunnels before the vampaneze found us - the sunlight should prevent them from pursuing us any further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA short while later, we heard the vampaneze and vampets. They were coming up the tunnels at great speed, not having to worry about stealth. Mr Crepsley dropped back a bit, to check if they were following us, but they didn\u0027t seem to have found our trail - all of them appeared to have gone after Vancha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe continued to climb, working our way closer to the surface. Our pursuers kept passing in and out of earshot. By the sounds they made, they\u0027d realized we weren\u0027t following the shortest route back, and had stopped and fanned out in search of us. I guessed that we were at least half an hour from ground level. If they located us any time soon, we were certainly doomed. The tunnels were as tight as they were dark - a lone, well-placed vampet would have no difficulty mowing us down with a rifle or arrow-gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were picking our way over a heap of rubble in a crumbling tunnel when we were eventually spotted. A vampet with a torch entered the tunnel at the far end, picked us out with a strong beam of light, and roared triumphantly. \"I\u0027ve found them! They\u0027re here! They?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got no further. A figure stepped out of the shadows behind him, grabbed his head and twisted sharply, left then right. The vampet dropped to the ground. His assailant paused just long enough to turn off the torch, then hurried over. I knew without having to see him that it was Vancha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good timing,\" Harkat muttered as the scraggly Prince joined us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been shadowing you for a while,\" Vancha said. \"He\u0027s not the first one I\u0027ve picked off. He just got a bit closer to you than the others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any idea how far we are from the surface?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Vancha said. \"I was ahead of you earlier, but I\u0027ve been bringing up the rear for the last quarter of an hour, covering you and laying a few false trails.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the vampaneze?\" Mr Crepsley said. \"Are they close?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye,\" came Vancha\u0027s reply, and then he slipped away again, to provide more cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlightly further ahead, we found ourselves in familiar tunnels. We\u0027d explored a vast slice of the city\u0027s infrastructure when hunting for the vampaneze, and had been in this section three or four times. We were no more than six or seven minutes from safety. Mr Crepsley whistled loudly, signalling to Vancha. The Prince swiftly joined us and we pushed on vigorously, finding a new lease of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There they go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shout came from a tunnel to our left. We didn\u0027t stop to check how many were nearby - putting our heads down, we pushed Steve and the vampet in front and ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampaneze weren\u0027t long surging after us. Vancha dropped back and kept them at bay with his shurikens - sharp, multi-edged throwing stars which were lethal when thrown by one as experienced as Vancha March. By the hysterical voices, I knew most - if not all - of the vampaneze and vampets had now converged behind us, but the tunnel we were in ran straight ahead, with hardly any side-tunnels opening out of it. Our enemies weren\u0027t able to sneak around and attack us from the sides or in front - they were forced to follow behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we got closer to street level, the tunnels grew brighter, and my half-vampire eyes quickly adjusted to the dim light. I was now able to see the vampaneze and vampets trailing behind - and they were able to see us! The vampaneze, like vampires, had sworn not to use any missile-firing weapons such as guns or bows, but the vampets weren\u0027t limited by that oath. They began firing as soon as they had a clear line of sight, and we had to run doubled-over. Ifwe\u0027d had to cover a long distance in that uncomfortable crouch, they\u0027d have surely picked us off one by one, but within a minute of them opening fire, we arrived at a steel ladder leading up to a manhole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go!\" Vancha barked, unleashing a hail of shurikens at the vampets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Crepsley grabbed me and shoved me up the ladder. I didn\u0027t protest at being first. It made the most sense - if the vampaneze pressed forward, Mr Crepsley was better equipped to fight them off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the top of the ladder I braced myself, then heaved against the manhole cover with my shoulders. It flew off, clearing the way up. I hauled myself out and quickly checked my surroundings. I was in the middle of a small street; it was early in the morning and nobody was about. Leaning back over the manhole, I yelled, \"It\u0027s clear!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeconds later, Steve Leopard crawled out of the manhole, grimacing in the sunlight (almost blinding after being down the tunnels so long). Then Harkat came, followed by the vampet. There was a short delay after that. The tunnel underneath echoed with angry gun retorts. Fearing the worst, I was about to climb back down the ladder to check on Mr Crepsley and Vancha, when the orange-haired vampire burst out of the manhole, gasping wildly. Almost immediately, Vancha shot out after him. The pair must have jumped, one directly after the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Vancha was clear of the manhole, I stumbled across the street, picked up the cover, shuffled back with it and set it in place. Then all four of us gathered around it, Vancha grasping several shurikens, Mr Crepsley his knives, Harkat his axe, and me my sword. We waited ten seconds. Twenty. Half a minute. A minute passed. Mr Crepsley and Vancha were sweating stingingly beneath the wan glare of the morning sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVancha cocked an eyebrow at Mr Crepsley. \"Think they\u0027ve given up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the moment,\" Mr Crepsley nodded, backing off warily, switching his attention to Steve and the vampet, making sure they didn\u0027t make a break for freedom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should get out of - this city,\" Harkat said, wiping a layer of dried blood from around his stitched-together grey face. Like Mr Crepsley and Vancha, he was nicked in many places after his battle with the vampaneze, but the cuts weren\u0027t serious. \"It would be suicide to remain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Run, rabbits, run,\" Steve murmured, and I cuffed him around the ears again, shutting him up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not leaving Debbie,\" I said. \"R.V.\u0027s a crazed killer. I\u0027m not going to abandon her to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you do to that maniac to madden him so much?\" Vancha asked, peeking down one of the small holes in the manhole cover, still not entirely convinced that we were in the clear. The purple animal hides he dressed in were hanging from his frame in shreds, and his dyed green hair was flecked with blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" I sighed. \"There was an accident at the Cirque Du Freak. He?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have no time for recollections,\" Mr Crepsley interrupted, tearing off the left sleeve of his red shirt, which had been slashed in as many places as Vancha\u0027s hides. He squinted up at the sun. \"In our state, we cannot bear to stay in the sun very long. Whatever our choice, we must choose soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darren\u0027s right,\" Vancha said. \"We can\u0027t leave. Not because of Debbie - much as I like her, I wouldn\u0027t sacrifice myself for her - but the Lord of the Vampaneze. We know he\u0027s down there. We have to go after him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he\u0027s too well protected,\" Harkat protested. \"Those tunnels are full of vampaneze - and vampets. We\u0027d perish for certain if we went - down again. I say we flee and come back - later, with help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve forgotten Mr Tiny\u0027s warning,\" Vancha said. \"We can\u0027t ask other vampires for help. I don\u0027t care how poor the odds are - we must try to breach their defences and kill their Lord.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree,\" Mr Crepsley said. \"But now is not the time. We are wounded and exhausted. We should rest and form a plan of action. The question is, where do we retire to - the apartments we have been using, or elsewhere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elsewhere,\" Harkat said instantly. \"The vampaneze know where - we\u0027ve been living. If we stay, we\u0027d be crazy to go where - they can attack any time they like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I muttered. \"It was weird, the way they let us leave. I know Gannen said it was to spare the lives of his companions, but if they\u0027d killed us, they were guaranteed victory in the War of the Scars. I think there\u0027s more to it than he was letting on. Having spared us when they had us trapped on their own turf, I doubt they\u0027ll come all the way up here to fight on our territory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy companions mused on that in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we should return to our base and try to make sense of this,\" I said. \"Even if we can\u0027t, we can get some rest and tend to our wounds. Then, come night, we\u0027ll attack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds good to me,\" Vancha said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As good a plan as any,\" Mr Crepsley sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harkat?\" I asked the Little Person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis round green eyes were full of doubt, but he grimaced and nodded. \"I think we\u0027re fools to stay, but if - we\u0027re going to, I guess at least we have weapons and - provisions there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides,\" Vancha added grimly, \"most of the apartments are empty. It\u0027s quiet.\" He ran a menacing finger along the neck of his captured vampet, a shaven-headed man with the dark \u0027V\u0027 of the vampets tattooed above either ear. \"There are some questions I want answered, but the asking won\u0027t be pleasant. It\u0027ll be for the best if there\u0027s nobody around to hear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampet sneered at Vancha as though unimpressed, but I could see fear in his blood-rimmed eyes. Vampaneze had the strength to withstand horrible torture, but vampets were human. A vampire could do terrible things to a human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Crepsley and Vancha wrapped their robes and hides around their heads and shoulders, to protect them from the worst of the sun. Then, pushing Steve and the vampet ahead of us, we climbed to roof level, got our bearings, and wearily headed for base. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/killers-of-the-dawn-the-saga-of-darren-shan-9/page-1.html","bookId":2445,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:18:45 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:18:45 PM"}
