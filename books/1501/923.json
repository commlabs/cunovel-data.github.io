Ji Ning and quite a few others had spent the previous day recuperating in the Azurecloud World, so as to be in peak condition when they challenged the Silvercloud World. Only a few people like Ning were able to fight for so long, after all; the majority relied on highly exhausting divine abilities that could allow them to unleash obliterating levels of power for brief moments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the third day, all of the remaining geniuses of the Twelve Palaces began to challenge the Silvercloud World.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Greatjoy has come out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s Greatjoy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery person seated on the thirteen thrones, the almighty Hegemon included, was staring at one particular scene. This was the image displaying Prince Greatjoy challenging the Silvercloud World.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So fast.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s blowing through them like rotted wood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hegemon, I feel upset each time I see Greatjoy. I really feel regretful that I wasn’t able to recruit him into our Skymetal Palace.” A handsome youth dressed in beautiful golden robes let out a sigh. “I could tell all those years ago that he had excellent potential, even though he was very weak starting off. In the end, the Spacetime Palace managed to lure him in… and then he somehow became one of your honorary disciples, Hegemon! Judging from how he is blasting through the Silvercloud World, he’s clearly become much more powerful once again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ahaha, Severtrip, jealousy won’t get you anything. Greatjoy is now a member of our Spacetime Palace.” A jade-eyed man with tousled hair let out a loud laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is true that Greatjoy has improved quite rapidly.” The almighty Hegemon stroked his pristine white beard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe almighty Hegemon’s accomplishments in the Dao of Spacetime allowed him to look down upon all others in the Endless Territories. In the Twelve Palaces, he was particularly close to the Spacetime Palace, and some of its dazzling geniuses would be given a chance to earn one of his legacies and become an honorary disciples! Prince Greatjoy was one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hegemon and the twelve golden-armored lords continued to stare at the many scenes playing out in midair. Prince Greatjoy was moving farther and farther up the stairs to the altar, defeating one golem after another along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumble…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrince Greatjoy’s body shone with golden light as he manifested six arms and began to sweep forward with even greater power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis palm-arts, fist-arts, finger-arts… they were all unfathomably profound and ridiculously powerful. Sometimes he moved quickly, sometimes he moved slowly, but the region of spacetime surrounding him was in a perpetual state of flux. It was extremely difficult for the golems attacking him to unleash their true power, but every single strike of Prince Greatjoy’s contained tremendous might.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoom! Boom! Boom!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe devastated his way through the golems, his entire body have transformed into a golden color. He looked like a golden god of war, but a look of absolute, glacial calm was in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s already reached six hundred!” Daolord Thousand Waves let out a startled cry. “Given how he’s cruised his way to the six hundredth level, he might have a shot at giving Solewind a run for his money.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Silvercloud World was actually one enormous altar that had nine hundred levels that served as the ‘steps’ to the top of the altar. The farther up you went, the more powerful your foes would be. The distance you were able to travel was a testament to your strength!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, Heartlord Solewind was ranked number one. He had made it to the 692nd step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRanked in second place was Saberlord Redsnow of the Saber Palace. He had made it to the 680th step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRanked third and fourth were members of the Saber Palace who had made it past the 600th step as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e600 steps… this represented a certain level of power. Most of the acknowledged cultivators had already completed their attempts, but only eight had made it past the 600th step!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Given how easy it was for him to make it past the six hundredth level, he does indeed have a shot at matching Solewind.” Lord Woodflower nodded slowly as he gave his appraisal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hard to say. He makes it look easy, but he might’ve already unleashed his full power,” the nearby Daolord Yinwind retorted coldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just keep watching.” Lord Woodflower glanced sideways at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmph.” Daolord Yinwind stared hard at the scene playing out before him. Prince Greatjoy was still steadily advancing. Starting from the six hundredth level, the golems became much more powerful and and much more numerous. In fact, there could be as many as twenty or thirty of them attacking you at the same time. However, Prince Greatjoy’s mastery over spacetime allowed him to tower over almost all World-level cultivators of the Twelve Palaces. He was able find unconceivable openings and positions, allowing him to never have to face more than three golems at one time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoom! Boom! Boom!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Six hundred fifty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Six hundred sixty. Six hundred seventy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaolord Yinwind’s face grew uglier and uglier to behold, because Prince Greatjoy had just caused a member of the Saber Palace to be eliminated from this competition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Six hundred eighty! He’s still advancing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Six hundred ninety!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrince Greatjoy’s face was starting to turn solemn, but a look of madness was in his eyes. His entire body radiated that blinding golden light, and each of his attacks contained utterly earth-shaking power. The golems were able to land an occasional attack against him, but were completely unable to harm him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He must have reached at least the eighth stage in the [Illusory Jade] secret art.” The youth dressed in the beautiful golden robes, Daolord Severtrip, let out a sigh when he saw this. “This secret art isn’t all that profound, but he still was able to reach the level of near-perfection in it. This is a secret art of our Dao of Metal… he really should’ve entered our Skymetal Palace.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He beat him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He moved past Solewind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe farther one advanced, the more difficult each level became. Prince Greatjoy’s face was extremely solemn now. He was finding it extremely difficult to advance, with the golems doing everything they could to oppose him!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Six hundred ninety-nine… seven hundred! He made it to level seven hundred.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Previously, the only members of the Twelve Palaces who made it past level seven hundred at the World level were Bertulu and Eastcult. Now, Greatjoy has joined their ranks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ancient powers sighed in amazement as they saw this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Prince Greatjoy, he gritted his teeth and fought like a madman. By nature, he wasn’t the type of person to easily admit defeat, and he still stubbornly fought and clawed his way forwards. He had reached exceedingly great heights in both the Dao of Spacetime and the Dao of Metal, and had also received personal guidance from the almighty Hegemon himself. Now, faced with such tremendous pressure, he actually began to slowly grow stronger and stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumble…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlas, with each step he took the golems became increasingly terrifying as well, and even more of them were appearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoom! Boom! BOOM!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne missed strike and he was almost instantly knocked flying. Moments later, ropes tightened around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDefeat!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been defeated at the 719th step!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ancient powers seated within the thirteen thrones couldn’t help but sigh in amazement. When they met and spoke with the most talented geniuses like Prince Greatjoy, they virtually treated those geniuses as equals, because once these geniuses made their breakthroughs they would quickly become comparable to Daolords of the Third Step. Once they engaged in a bit of training, they would quickly be able to compare to Daolords of the Fourth Step. It would be very easy for them to become major figures within the Endless Territories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, Prince Greatjoy was ranked number one after having made it to the 719th level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeartlord Solewind was ranked second after having made it to the 692nd level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRanked third was Saberlord Redsnow, level 680.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumber four was Saberlord Grief, level 668.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Azurecloud World of the Daolord Cloudworld.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJi Ning rose to his feet and walked directly towards the highest position on the island he was in. When he reached it, a spacetime vortex formed around him. Ning disappeared from the Azurecloud World.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the Silvercloud World.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a world shaped like an utterly enormous altar that had nine hundred steps to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What an enormous altar.” Ning craned his neck as he stared upwards, seeing the many golems roving about. He could also hear faint booms ringing out from far ahead. “There are other cultivators here right now as well? I wonder which member of the Sword Palace is here… or perhaps it is one of the other Swordlords?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were so many golems within the altar that ten cultivators could challenge this world at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Time to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing held a pair of Eternal swords in his hands as he advanced forwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“GWAAAAR!” Instantly, a pitch-black golem shaped like a three-headed, four-legged beast let out a roar as it pounced towards Ning like a streak of light, moving roughly three times as fast as the speed of light! This single level was roughly as long as the entire Azurecloud World had been, but it was merely a million kilometers wide. A million kilometers might seem like a long distance, but major powers were able to traverse it with just a single step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmph.” Ning looked at the golem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoom! Instantly, Ning’s body radiated with lightning, water, and many other types of light. Some were dazzling, some were ruinous, some were subdued. The seven types of Dao lightning all had different auras, as did the same types of Dao water. Still, Ning was able to fully control all of them, and with but a thought Ning caused them to join together into a Heptastar Duality Formation. An enormous, dazzling, bizarre formation appeared in the air which completely covered the four-legged beast which was charging towards Ning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoom! Although the beast-golem let out a furious howl, it was still forced several steps backwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing was able to advance to the second level with ease. As he continued his advance, the golems became increasingly powerful. In fact, there were even a few golems that attacked from afar using magic treasures, and the effectiveness of Ning’s Hepastar Duality Formation began to lessen. Ning had to unleash his sword-arts to fight as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoom! Boom! Boom!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing’s sword-arts were quite mighty, allowing him to sweep through all obstacles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo hundred steps. Three hundred steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eh?” Ning’s ears suddenly pricked up. “It seems everything went silent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been another cultivator fighting on the other side of the altar. Moments ago, explosions had been ringing out unabated. Now, nothing could be heard at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Woodflower, your Swordlord Wildfire has been defeated as well. He lost on the 597th step. He almost made it to the 600th!” Daolord Yinwind glanced sideways at Daolord Woodflower. “Right now, the only remaining member in your Sword Palace is that kid who just became a Swordlord a short while ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaolord Woodflower ignored Daolord Yinwind’s mockery. Instead, he stared at the scene of Ji Ning forging his way ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, Ji Ning was the only member of the Sword Palace who was still taking part in the challenge. All the others had already failed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/desolate-era/de-book-27-chapter-19\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/desolate-era/de-book-27-chapter-21\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/desolate-era/de-book-27-chapter-20","bookId":1501,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:16:13 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:16:13 AM"}
