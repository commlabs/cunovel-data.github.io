Myself, yet not myself. The sensation should have been frightening; instead it had been...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Comforting.\" My voice was my own again. I no longer felt... full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was comforting?\" Cassandra asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Erzulie. She\u0027s like...\" Again I groped for a word to describe her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tilted my head. \"If you say so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother was nothing like Erzulie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra frowned, but she refrained from exploring that avenue, thank goodness. Bending, she untwined Lazarus from her ankle, then dumped him into his box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me everything,\" she ordered, so I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was finished, Cassandra bit her lip, and her forehead crinkled. I began to get uneasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You went further than anyone else ever has. Most only hear the voice of the loa, become a little scrambled. You traveled to Ife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t go anywhere. Did I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not physically.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just traveled to He in my head.\" I paused. \"What\u0027s He?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a town called Ife in Nigeria, but the one you went to is a legendary place, the mecca of vodoun, where the revelations of the has came to the first faithful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Terrific,\" I muttered. \"And what about this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI showed her the petal of the fire iris that I\u0027d picked in a place I hadn\u0027t actually gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe you brought a piece back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does it mean that I did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow. You\u0027re as helpful as she was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra ignored me. I wished I could do that whenever someone was annoying. Instead, I always felt compelled to sarcasm them to death - or at least until they went away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep the petal nearby,\" Cassandra said. \"Any questions you have should soon be answered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just like that? Poof. I know the truth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI narrowed my eyes. \"What happened in the past when you performed this ceremony?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The has came, inhabited someone else, and answered their questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Truthfully?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Loas don\u0027t he.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why didn\u0027t she answer me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you had too many questions. Maybe she didn\u0027t know the answers. Maybe you could only discover the truth by seeing it yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe this is all bullshit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra tilted her head, and I had to admit, if the previous hour had been bullshit, it was extremely convincing bullshit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind.\" I tightened my fingers around the petal. \"I\u0027ll just wait for the answers. Should be along anytime now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You believe?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI considered the question, remembered what had happened, where I\u0027d been, how I\u0027d felt\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" How could I not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to do some research,\" Cassandra said. \"Make some calls. Find out why you traveled to Ife. How you could have brought something out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thought occurred to me. \"Isn\u0027t there bom good and bad voodoo?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re mirror images. Can\u0027t have one without the other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So Erzulie might have been bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. The has are all about truth. It\u0027s the maker of the magic who brings about good or bad. We call the evildoers \u0027ones who serve the has with bom hands.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You used both hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s an expression. Don\u0027t you trust me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe appeared so crestfallen, I wanted to reassure her, but I didn\u0027t want to lie, either. \"I\u0027ve never dealt with voodoo, Cassandra. For all I know you could have been calling Satan himself. He could be running around New Orleans having a grand old time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He already is,\" she said dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha-ha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You spoke to the loa, Diana, which means the good or the evil intent came from you. Are you evil?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about it. \"Sometimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That just makes you human. When you asked for help, direction, truth, did you ask so you could use the result to hurt someone else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then go in peace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at my watch and my eyes widened. \"It\u0027s almost morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time flies,\" Cassandra said. \"Let me put that petal into something before you ruin or lose it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rustled through the mess on one of the shelves and came up with an empty gris-gris bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have those lying around all over the place?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t bother to answer, just held open the bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated. \"Will it work in there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I had to take her word for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should leave. I wanted to discover if the petal would reveal the truth, but -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"How will I know what\u0027s true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is so not helpful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s like love - you\u0027ll just know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll know the love I\u0027m afraid is contrived is real because I\u0027ll just know. That makes no sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does?\" As usual, she ignored my scowl. \"If you find a charm, destroying it should break the spell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does a charm look like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could be a gris-gris, or maybe a fetish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A small figure - wood, bone, maybe stone, even cloth - fashioned into the shape of a person. Many cultures use totems for luck, for curses or charms - both good and evil.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" I said. \"Find something weird, destroy it, and the magic is gone.\" Although how I would destroy stone, I had no idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or you could just leave it be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced up. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is being in love with him so bad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need the truth, Cassandra. That\u0027s just the way I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded as if she\u0027d known I\u0027d say that. Hell, she probably had. \"If Erzulie said the truth would be revealed, it will. I\u0027m not sure how, or why, or when, but have faith.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Faith has never been my strong suit,\" I muttered, and left\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I\u0027d had faith in Simon none of this would have been necessary. But if I hadn\u0027t had it then, in him, how could I have it now in someone I barely knew and in something I didn\u0027t trust?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGot me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever one to put off what I could do today, I drove past Adam\u0027s trailer, but his car wasn\u0027t there. I even walked out to the shack, but it was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I spent my time setting up a trap in the clearing where Charlie had died. Scene of the crime and all that. Besides, I didn\u0027t have a better idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also had my doubts the snare would work. If a werewolf had human eyes, it might have a human brain, and then the beast would know better than to creep into the cage and let the door close behind it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, I planned to be sitting in a tree with my loaded tranquilizer gun. If I had to, I\u0027d shoot the thing, men shove it inside myself. There was more than one way to skin a cat. Although I\u0027d never actually figured out a second way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spent several days tramping through the swamp in the heat, went to town a few times for supplies. Then I endured as many nights with very little sleep, lying alone on the floor, listening to weird noises and faraway howls that should be coyotes but weren\u0027t. I hadn\u0027t seen Adam, and I\u0027d kind of stopped looking for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d been all gung ho for the truth, but the more time passed, the more time I had to think about things, the more afraid I became. What if he\u0027d misled me about something important? Something I wouldn\u0027t be able to forgive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if Luc had cast a spell over me, and what I felt for both of them was a lie? I didn\u0027t want it to be a lie. Caring for Adam and his son was the first thing that had felt right in a long, long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI considered Cassandra\u0027s suggestion that I just let everything be. It wasn\u0027t a bad suggestion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, what if there wasn\u0027t a spell? What if I truly loved Adam and he didn\u0027t love me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI considered all the questions that had no answers as I took a sponge bath in the tributary in front of the mansion. I never had managed to rent another hotel room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fell asleep eating a sandwich on my sleeping bag. I must have been near meltdown, because I didn\u0027t wake up until sometime after sunset and only then because I sensed I wasn\u0027t alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart kicked up a notch, but before I could fully panic, a silhouette appeared in the window. I\u0027d know that shape anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer, just crossed the room and lowered himself onto the sleeping bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell, let\u0027s be honest, he towered himself onto me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing adorning his upper body was his bracelet I liked him best that way. His khakis were soft, his body already hard. Despite the clothes, we fit together just right. Pressure, friction, heat. What more could a girl ask for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTruth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that moment, I understood that I couldn\u0027t go on without knowing it Where was that petal?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept one hand on his shoulder while the other crept around like Thing from The Addams Family. I was distracted by Adam\u0027s lips crushing mine, his tongue sweeping into my mouth. I wore loose shorts and his fingers skimmed my thigh, drifted higher, slipped beneath. His thumb stroked in a rhythm to match his tongue, and I forgot about the gris-gris bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter my makeshift bath, the high temperature had made me opt for a thin light green camisole. I hadn\u0027t even considered a bra. So when his lips closed around my nipple, the moist heat encircled me as if there weren\u0027t anything between us but air. Not long after, there wasn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t spoken, had barely looked at me, and I needed him to, so I touched his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes met mine at the very first thrust. My free hand clenched as did my body, and my fingers brushed the gris-gris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gathered the small bag into my palm, and a breeze swirled through the room. Scented with cinnamon, it whispered indecipherable words but left behind a feeling of certainty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever else might be a lie, this was the truth. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-crescent-moon-nightcreature-4/page-33.html","bookId":2091,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:32 PM"}
