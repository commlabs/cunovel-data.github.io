{"id":31972,"no":19,"title":"Chapter 12","content":"In the silence that followed, Humphrey stood bewildered. The harsh note in Ferrol\u0027s voice surprised him; what on earth could it matter to Ferrol whether he married or not. And Ferrol must have read his thoughts, and seen his mistake at once.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course,\" he said, \"it\u0027s no business of mine. Your life\u0027s your own. Only I think you\u0027re too young for that sort of thing. Why, you haven\u0027t seen the world yet. You haven\u0027t a father, have you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No,\" said Humphrey.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well\"—Ferrol\u0027s voice softened—\"you won\u0027t mind my advising you then.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No,\" said Humphrey again: already he seemed to feel Lilian slipping from his grasp.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m looking at it simply from the business point of view. No man has a right to marry until his position is made—least of all a reporter.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But she would help me,\" Humphrey pleaded. \"She would be able to help me. She would ...\" he broke off.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ferrol completed the sentence for him. \"Keep you straight. Yes, I know. I\u0027ve heard it all before. The man who needs a woman to keep him straight is only half a man.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But,\" continued Humphrey—and he thought of Wratten and Tommy Pride—\"we don\u0027t get much out of life—we\u0027re at work all day long, there\u0027s absolutely nobody ... I mean, there\u0027s nothing left in it all ...\" he spread his hands wide. \"At the end there\u0027s nothing ... emptiness.\" He stammered broken sentences[184] that had a queer impressiveness in them. \"I\u0027m nothing ... it seems to me ... all this life, rushing about all day ... and everything forgotten to-morrow ... there\u0027s nothing that lasts ... nothing except....\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, you think you\u0027ll get happiness,\" Ferrol said. \"Perhaps you will. But every moment of happiness is going to cost you years of misery. As soon as you marry, what happens? You are no longer independent. You\u0027ve got to lie down and take all the kicks. You\u0027ve got to submit to be ground down; to be insulted by men whom you dare not strike back, as you would, if you had only yourself to think of.... And then, you know, in a year\u0027s time, you\u0027ve got to work ... double as hard, and to watch every penny, and to save.... Why, you young fool, don\u0027t you see that if you\u0027re going to get on in this business, you mustn\u0027t have any other wish in life but to rise to the top. Everything must be put aside for that—you must even put aside yourself. You must have only one love—the love of the game; the love of the hunter for his quarry.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What made Ferrol talk like this.... What had happened to Humphrey that he should be there, standing up to Ferrol, fighting the question of his marriage? Something new and unexpected had thrust itself into their relations, and Humphrey could not understand it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But that\u0027s what I want to do,\" he said; \"we should do it together.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes. How?\" said Ferrol, a little brutally again. \"Shall I tell you? I know you young men who marry the moment you see a marrying wage. It\u0027s all very well for you—you may progress—you may develop—you\u0027re bound to, for men knock about and gather world experience. But what of the woman at home?—cooped up in her home with babies? Eh? have you thought of that? Where would your home be? You haven\u0027t got as far as that, then. The woman stands still, and[185] you march on. She can lift you up, but you can\u0027t lift her up. And then the day comes that you\u0027re a brilliant man—the most brilliant man in the Street, if you like....\" Ferrol smiled. \"Oh! you never know. Think of John K. Garton, and Mallaby, and Owers.... And you\u0027re different. You can link up the things of life. You can perceive and appreciate pictures and fine music and the meaning of everything that matters ... and for the woman who has not been able to progress, nothing but popular songs, chromographs, and ignorance of anything but the petty little things of to-day. Then you hear people saying, \u0027How on earth did he come to marry her?\u0027 There\u0027s always an answer to that. He didn\u0027t marry her. It was another man—the man he was twenty years ago—who did it. Do you see?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Humphrey looked about him forlornly. His dreams were crumbling before the onslaught of Ferrol\u0027s remorseless less words. The powerful magnetism of this man held him: he felt sure that Ferrol was right.... Ferrol was only voicing the thoughts that he himself had feared to express. Above the inward turmoil of his mind, he heard again the voice of Ferrol, forceful and insistent:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are not the man you will be in twenty years\u0027 time. There\u0027s no reason,\" he added hastily, \"why I should take all this trouble over you ... no reason at all ... it\u0027s no concern of mine. Other people on my staff can do as they please—for some men marriage is the best thing ... I don\u0027t interfere. I\u0027m not interfering now. I\u0027m only giving my point of view.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes ... I know,\" Humphrey said, and somehow or other he seemed to feel an extraordinary sympathy for Ferrol; he seemed to understand this man. At that moment he would have stood forth for Ferrol and championed him against a world of hatred!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Only I thought ...\" Humphrey began. \"You see, she supports her family....\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [186]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"O Lord!\" Ferrol groaned. \"It\u0027s worse than I imagined.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Besides, she\u0027s ... she\u0027s clever ... we have the same tastes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course you have. But your tastes will alter. You\u0027re going to progress.... And she\u0027s going to progress, too, on different lines.... A woman\u0027s line of progress is different ... and in twenty years\u0027 time!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The telephone bell rang. Ferrol took up the receiver.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, that\u0027s all,\" he said to Humphrey. And then: \"I don\u0027t take this trouble with every one.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Humphrey groped for words. \"No ... I understand ... I see what you mean.... You don\u0027t think....\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ferrol nodded. \"You can do what you like, of course.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He put the receiver to his ear and began talking rapidly.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1879/54345.html","bookId":801,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 3:48:50 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 3:48:50 AM"}
