An ex-New York cop, he had drowned his career in booze. Now he was drinking away his life in a succession of seedy establishments that opened early and closed late, reduced to doing paid \"favors\" for the cronies who gathered with him to worship the bottle. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eNow, in a sad and lonely place like so many before it, opportunity comes knocking — a chance to help the ginmil\u0027s owner recover his stolen doctored financial records; a chance to help out a drinking buddy accused of murdering his wife. But when cases flow together in dangerous and disturbing ways — like the nightmare images in a drunkard\u0027s delirium — it\u0027s time for Scudder to change his priorities: to staying sober...and staying alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/when-the-sacred-ginmill-closes-matthew-scudder-6.jpg","author":"Lawrence Block","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/when-the-sacred-ginmill-closes-matthew-scudder-6.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:36 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:26 AM"}
