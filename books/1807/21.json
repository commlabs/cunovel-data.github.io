It caught the bug, but it smacked Elise in the face with its powerful wings that had the force of a swinging sack of potatoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ouch, go away,” Elise said, her eyes watering with pain as she tried to push the swan off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe swan chortled and smacked her again with its wings as it left, retreating to the pond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please, please let the Lady Enchantress Angelique succeed in overthrowing Clotilde,” Elise said, holding her throbbing nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurrounded only by animals, nothing answered her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise rubbed down Falk’s horse with bit of cloth she ripped off her black skirt and dipped in the pond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer swan brothers floated on the water or puttered around on the shore, looking for bugs and grass to eat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne swan sat near Elise and the horse, watching them with a tilted head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise offered the swan a smile. “Rune?” she tried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe swan didn’t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise glanced at the horse and then back to the swan. “Falk? Do you recognize your horse?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe swan lunged to its black feet, snapping a bug midair. It chortled to itself before it went back to the pond, drawing a sigh from Elise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been a week, and her brothers still acted like swans. Sometimes she thought one of them might be responding, but it always was because there was a bug buzzing through the air, or they were watching because they were looking at a nearby animal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise wanted to believe that as she was a part of their family—foster child or not—she might be able to stir their memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was having no such luck. She hadn’t even identified Rune, and he was the Royal Prince she was closest to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother swan approached Elise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise smiled and extended a hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe swan pecked her, pinching and twisting the soft skin on her wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise yelped. The swan flapped its wings and moved on, which was a good thing as Elise burned with the desire to kick the white bird. Instead, she clamped a hand over her smarting skin and stared up at the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA raindrop fell on her face. Seconds later, another fat droplet plopped on her nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it started to downpour, Elise breathed in through her nose, carefully gathering up her craving to bawl and strangling it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA princess didn’t cry. At least, Queen Ingrid wouldn’t have. The Queen would expect Elise to be better than hysterics, as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise headed for the trees, dragging Falk’s horse by its bridle-turned-halter. A few of the swans joined her long enough to ram into her and hit her with their wings before they returned to the pond, unbothered by the water that slid off their slick feathers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If Angelique doesn’t succeed, I will have to do something,” Elise said. “Clotilde might get her wish after all; I might have to marry a foreign prince in order to mobilize his troops to rescue my country.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe prospect of marrying a foreign dignitary did not delight Elise. She always knew that her Father wouldn’t thoughtlessly auction her off to allies. He would keep her in the country, hopefully letting her wed her choice of men. Preferably she would marry Mertein—who was a good choice as the first son of a prominent noble family. It was the greatest happily ever after Elise could have dared to dream for, and she did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now, watching her brothers—watching the swans really—Elise knew if anyone was going to save Arcainia and get rid of Clotilde, it would have to be her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lucien is a toad,” Elise said, thinking of the crown prince of Loire. “But if he is still open to a marriage contract, he may be my best bet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRain continued to fall, filling the air with a steady pitter patting as it fell against tree leaves and the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA swan hissed when another swan pecked it, and Elise closed her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will marry for the sake of Arcainia, for Father, and for my foster brothers if I must,” she said. “I just wish…,” Elise trailed off, unable to finish the thought. She watched the rain fall and thought longingly of the sweet moments she shared with Mertein.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was dusk. Several more days had passed, and as each day turned into the next, Elise steeled her resolve. It didn’t seem like Angelique, the Lady Enchantress, would be returning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise watched the swans float on the pond, bobbing up and down in the ripples colored by the last rays of the sun. They looked beautiful, the rising moon made their stark white feathers glow as they arched their necks and paddled in the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Another week, maybe two. If I don’t hear from Angelique before then, I will know something must have gone terribly wrong,” Elise said, resting her head on her knees as she sat on the sandy bank that bordered the pond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the swans made a strange, questioning noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElise looked up to see the swan peck at the churning water surface. There was no wind, but waves crested in the pond as if it were part of the ocean. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-wild-swans-timeless-fairy-tales-2/page-21.html","bookId":1807,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:52:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:52:55 PM"}
