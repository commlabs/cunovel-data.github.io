I’m leaving for the Dominican Republic tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. I’m sorry.” Chris doesn’t look the least bit sorry; she has a huge grin on her face. “It’s so crazy. A spot opened up for me at an eco-hotel, and there’s no way I can pass this up. They speak Spanish in the Dominican Republic, too, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. But I thought you were going to Costa Rica!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShrugging, she says, “This other opportunity came up so I pounced on it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But—I can’t believe you’re leaving so soon! You weren’t supposed to leave until August. When do you come back?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. . . . I guess that’s the beauty of it. I could stay for six months, or something else will come up and I’ll go there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blink. “So you’re leaving for good, then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egood\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. Just for now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething inside of me knows that this really is for good. I don’t see Chris coming back here a year from now\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto go to Piedmont Virginia Community College. This is Chris, the stray cat, who comes and goes as she pleases. She’ll always land on her cat tippy-toes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t look so sad. You’ll be fine without me. You have Kavinsky.” For a second I can’t breathe. Just hearing his name is like a dagger in my heart. “Anyway we’re all leaving soon enough. I’m just glad I’m not going to be left behind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s how it would feel to her—staying here, going to a community college, working at Applebee’s. I feel a surge of gladness that instead of that, she’s off on an adventure. “I just can’t believe you’re leaving so soon.” I don’t tell her that Peter and I broke up, that I don’t have him anymore. Today isn’t about me and Peter; it’s about Chris, and her exciting new future. “Can I at least come help you pack?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m already packed! I’m only bringing the essentials. My leather jacket, bikinis, a few crystals.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shouldn’t you bring sneakers and work gloves and that kind of thing, just in case?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll wear sneakers on the plane, and whatever else I need, I’ll get when I’m there. That’s the whole point of an adventure. Pack light and figure the rest out as you go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought we’d have more time, me and Chris in my bedroom, sharing secrets late into the night, eating chips in bed. I wanted to cement our friendship before she left: Lara Jean and Chrissy, like the old days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s all ending. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/always-and-forever-lara-jean-to-all-the-boys-i-ve-loved-before-3/page-38.html","bookId":1775,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM"}
