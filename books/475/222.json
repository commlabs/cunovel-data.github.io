Love permits pain. The sisters never doubted that He would speed at all hazards and stay their brother from death, but, \"When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhat a startling \"therefore\"! He abstained from going, not because He did not love them, but because He did love them. His love alone kept Him back from hasting at once to the dear and stricken home. Anything less than infinite love must have rushed instantly to the relief of those loved and troubled hearts, to stay their grief and to have the luxury of wiping and stanching their tears and causing sorrow and sighing to flee away. Divine love could alone hold back the impetuosity of the Savior\u0027s tender-heartedness until the Angel of Pain had done her work. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWho can estimate how much we owe to suffering and pain? But for them we should have little scope for many of the chief virtues of the Christian life.
