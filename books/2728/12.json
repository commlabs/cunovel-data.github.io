So it’ll just be us four, and we can fit into one car that way. I’ll pick you up at six.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay. Great.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*\u0026nbsp; *\u0026nbsp; *\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh is late, as always. I’m outside on the curb waiting for her. Just for fun I put on a Jar Island varsity sweatshirt and tied my hair up in one of my cheerleader ribbons. When she arrives, almost twenty minutes late, I climb into the front seat. We pick up Derek next, and then PJ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI expect Ash is going to head straight to the ferry, since the next one leaves in a few minutes, but instead she makes a left and speeds toward T-Town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Derek,” Ash says, rolling through a stop sign. “Text Reeve and tell him to be outside in five minutes. If he’s not there, we’re leaving without him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean forward. “What? I thought you said he wasn’t coming.” If I’d known Reeve was coming, there’s no way I would have said yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess he changed his mind,” Ash says with a shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pray that Reeve isn’t outside, that we will leave without him, but he’s sitting on his front stairs as we pull up. I flip down the visor and touch up my lipstick so I don’t have to make eye contact with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as we get to the other high school’s gym, I say that I have to go to the bathroom just so I can make sure that we don’t end up sitting next to each other on the bleachers. On my way back I see two girls standing with Reeve at the bottom of the stands. I can tell he’s not interested in talking to them, because he keeps looking over their shoulders. But I still feel a pang of jealousy as I walk by, until I hear one of them mention the Montessori school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God. What if it somehow gets back to Mary that I’m here with Reeve?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push the thought away. I don’t even know where Mary is. And I don’t think she keeps in touch with any of the Montessori kids from back in the day. I climb the bleachers, take a seat between PJ and Derek, and keep really focused on the basketball game, even though it’s insanely boring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the game everybody starts piling into Ash’s car, and I immediately go for the front seat again, but Derek shakes his head at me. “No way, Lil. You’re the smallest one here. You don’t get shotgun again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Derek!” I protest. He is tall, though—like, basketball-player tall. Ash has to get on her tippy-toes to kiss him. “Come on. Be a gentleman!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Backseat, baby,” he says, pulling the seat forward so I can climb in. Reeve and PJ are crammed into the back, and there’s barely room for the two of them, much less me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes meet Reeve’s. “But . . . there’s no room.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReeve tips his head back against the seat. Looking straight ahead, he says, “Cho, just get in. We’re going to miss the ferry home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can sit in Reeve’s lap,” Ash advises me. “Or stretch out on top.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is basically the opposite of what Kat told me to do. Reluctantly I climb in between the boys. I perch as lightly as I can, half on Reeve’s thigh and half on PJ’s. PJ doesn’t move—he’s looking at his phone—but Reeve shifts as far away from me as he can and holds on to the handle above the window. “You can scoot back a little,” he says, his voice gruff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine,” I say. To Ashlin I say, “Let’s go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh starts the car, and we zoom out of the high school’s parking lot. Ash is always speeding. She’s gotten, like, a million speeding tickets in just the one year she’s been driving. The car is quiet except for Ash and Derek talking to each other in low voices. Suddenly the light turns red, Ash slams on the brakes, and I start to fly forward, but Reeve grabs me by the waist with both arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ugh, why do they have a stoplight on this road anyway?” Ash complains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart’s pounding in my chest. Even though he doesn’t have to, Reeve’s still holding on to me tight, and just for a second I feel him sigh and fall his forehead against my back, but then, abruptly, his arms drop away from me. I think I can hear his heart beating fast too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the ferry ride back to Jar Island, Ashlin drops me off first. My mom’s light is off, and Nadia’s in her room doing her homework. I stop in to say good night, and we talk for a few minutes. I don’t even know what we’re talking about, because all I’m doing is thinking about him. And then Kat’s voice is in my head, telling me to shut it the eff down. This will only lead to trouble. She’s right. I know she is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI go through my nighttime routine of a bath, drying my hair just a little bit and then brushing it. I put on my big Harvard sweatshirt and thick socks and get into bed, and then I just lie there in the dark for what feels like forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd before I can talk myself out of it, before I can go through all the reasons why not, I’m crawling out of bed. I’m fumbling around for my leggings and my bra and my big puffy coat. I’m stuffing my keys and my phone inside the pocket, and then I’m creeping out into the hallway. It’s dark; everyone’s asleep. I crack open Nadia’s door just to make sure, and she is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I’m tiptoeing down the stairs, creeping out the back door, and running fast to my car. I don’t turn on the headlights until I’m out of the cul-de-sac. I don’t know what I’m doing. He might not even be awake. This is crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I drive, I keep thinking I should turn back around. I keep thinking it, and yet I don’t do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the lights are off at Reeve’s house except for in his room. I pull out my phone and text him, my hands shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you awake?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe writes back instantly. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReeve’s face appears in the window, and then it’s gone. I get out of the car and wait for him, shivering. I don’t have to wait long. He’s out the front door and running toward me in sweats, no coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s wrong?” he pants. “Did something happen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brow furrows. “Then why—why are you here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know.” I lift my shoulders and drop them. “I guess . . . I just wanted to see you.” Reeve is staring at me with a bewildered look on his face, and I feel my cheeks get hot. I turn away from him and back toward my car. “I shouldn’t have come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReeve grabs my arm. “Wait,” he says, and I spin back around, and before I can tell myself not to, I pull his face toward mine and I’m kissing him. He hesitates for a split second, and then he’s kissing me back, and I feel a jolt inside me. I lean back against the car, and I pull him with me. I can see the puffs our breaths make in the cold night air. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ashes-to-ashes-burn-for-burn-3/page-12.html","bookId":2728,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:24:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:24:16 PM"}
