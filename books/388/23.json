PREPARING FOR THE BURGLAR.","content":"\u0026nbsp;Carl stared at Mr. Thorndike in surprise and dismay. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “A burglar!” he ejaculated.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes; I was present in the courtroom when he was convicted of robbing the Springfield bank. I sat there for three hours, and his face was impressed upon my memory. I saw him later on in the Joliet Penitentiary. I was visiting the institution and saw the prisoners file out into the yard. I recognized this man instantly. Do you know how long he has been here?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “For two weeks I should think.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He has some dishonest scheme in his head, I have no doubt. Have you a bank in Milford?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He may have some design upon that.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He is very intimate with our bookkeeper, so his nephew tells me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Thorndike looked startled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ha! I scent danger to my friend, Mr. Jennings. He ought to be apprised.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He shall be, sir,” said Carl, firmly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Will you see him to-night?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, sir; I am not only in his employ, but I live at his house.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That is well.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Perhaps I ought to go home at once.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No attempt will be made to rob the office till late. It is scarcely eight o’clock. I don’t know, however, but I will walk around to the house with you, and tell your employer what I know. By the way, what sort of a man is the bookkeeper?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don’t know him very well, sir. He has a nephew in the office, who was transferred from the factory. I have taken his place.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do you think the bookkeeper would join in a plot to rob his employer?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don’t like him. To me he is always disagreeable, but I would not like to say that.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How long has he been in the employ of Mr. Jennings?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “As long as two years, I should think.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You say that this man is intimate with him?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Leonard Craig—he is the nephew—says that Mr. Philip Stark is at his uncle’s house every evening.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “So he calls himself Philip Stark, does he?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Isn’t that his name?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I suppose it is one of his names. He was convicted under that name, and retains it here on account of its being so far from the place of his conviction. Whether it is his real name or not, I do not know. What is the name of your bookkeeper?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Julius Gibbon.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don’t remember ever having heard it. Evidently there has been some past acquaintance between the two men, and that, I should say, is hardly a recommendation for Mr. Gibbon. Of course that alone is not enough to condemn him, but the intimacy is certainly a suspicious circumstance.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The two soon reached the house of Mr. Jennings, for the distance was only a quarter of a mile.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Jennings seemed a little surprised, but gave a kindly welcome to his unexpected guest. It occurred to him that he might have come to give some extra order for goods.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You are surprised to see me,” said Thorndike. “I came on a very important matter.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A look of inquiry came over the face of Mr. Jennings.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “There’s a thief in the village—a guest at the hotel—whom I recognize as one of the most expert burglars in the country.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I think I know whom you mean, a man of moderate height, rather thick set, with small, black eyes and a slouch hat.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Exactly.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What can you tell me about him?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Thorndike repeated the statement he had already made to Carl.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do you think our bank is in danger?” asked the manufacturer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Perhaps so, but the chief danger threatens you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Jennings looked surprised.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What makes you think so?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Because this man appears to be very intimate with your bookkeeper.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How do you know that?” asked the little man, quickly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I refer you to Carl.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Leonard Craig told me to-night that this man Stark spent every evening at his uncle’s house.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Jennings looked troubled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am sorry to hear this,” he said. “I dislike to lose confidence in any man whom I have trusted.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Have you noticed anything unusual in the demeanor of your bookkeeper of late?” asked Thorndike.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes; he has appeared out of spirits and nervous.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That would seem to indicate he is conspiring to rob you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “This very day, noticing the change in him, I offered him a week’s vacation. He promptly declined to take it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Of course. It would conflict with the plans of his confederate. I don’t know the man, but I do know human nature, and I venture to predict that your safe will be opened within a week. Do you keep anything of value in it?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “There are my books, which are of great value to me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But not to a thief. Anything else?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes; I have a tin box containing four thousand dollars in government bonds.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Coupon or registered?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Coupon.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Nothing could be better—for a burglar. What on earth could induce you to keep the bonds in your own safe?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “To tell the truth, I considered them quite as safe there as in the bank. Banks are more likely to be robbed than private individuals.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Circumstances alter cases. Does anyone know that you have the bonds in your safe?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “My bookkeeper is aware of it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then, my friend, I caution you to remove the bonds from so unsafe a depository as soon as possible. Unless I am greatly mistaken, this man, Stark, has bought over your bookkeeper, and will have his aid in robbing you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What is your advice?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “To remove the bonds this very evening,” said Thorndike.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do you think the danger so pressing?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Of course I don’t know that an attempt will be made to-night, but it is quite possible. Should it be so, you would have an opportunity to realize that delays are dangerous.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Should Mr. Gibbon find, on opening the safe to-morrow morning, that the box is gone, it may lead to an attack upon my house.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I wish you to leave the box in the safe.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But I understand that you advised me to remove it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Not the box, but the bonds. Listen to my plan. Cut out some newspaper slips of about the same bulk as the bonds, put them in place of the bonds in the box, and quietly transfer the bonds in your pocket to your own house. To-morrow you can place them in the bank. Should no burglary be attempted, let the box remain in the safe, just as if its contents were valuable.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Your advice is good, and I will adopt it,” said Jennings, “and thank you for your valuable and friendly instruction.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If agreeable to you I will accompany you to the office at once. The bonds cannot be removed too soon. Then if anyone sees us entering, it will be thought that you are showing me the factory. It will divert suspicion, even if we are seen by Stark or your bookkeeper.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “May I go, too?” asked Carl, eagerly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Certainly,” said the manufacturer. “I know, Carl, that you are devoted to my interests. It is a comfort to know this, now that I have cause to suspect my bookkeeper.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was only a little after nine. The night was moderately dark, and Carl was intrusted with a wax candle, which he put in his pocket for use in the office. They reached the factory without attracting attention, and entered by the office door.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Jennings opened the safe—he and the bookkeeper alone knew the combination—and with some anxiety took out the tin box. It was possible that the contents had already been removed. But no! on opening it, the bonds were found intact. According to Mr. Thorndike’s advice, he transferred them to his pocket, and substituted folded paper. Then, replacing everything, the safe was once more locked, and the three left the office.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Thorndike returned to the hotel, and Mr. Jennings to his house, but Carl asked permission to remain out a while longer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It is on my mind that an attempt will be made to-night to rob the safe,” he said. “I want to watch near the factory to see if my suspicion is correct.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very well, Carl, but don’t stay out too long!” said his employer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Suppose I see them entering the office, sir?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Don’t interrupt them! They will find themselves badly fooled. Notice only if Mr. Gibbon is of the party. I must know whether my bookkeeper is to be trusted.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2963/81565.html","bookId":388,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 4:08:52 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 4:08:52 AM"}
