She wondered if it was a tool of his new trade—did he need it on a daily basis, the way he needed Mace or plastic handcuffs? She wiped her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The minute I open my mouth about John . . . The board, the police—they all see it as a weak defense. Bitterness. Of course I would blame him. They don\u0027t believe me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ll talk to him,” Chadwick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What for? You know why he did it—to ruin me. To get custody. One more year, Chadwick, and Mallory turns sixteen. She can refuse treatment, sign herself out of any program. If John gets her now, I\u0027ll never have another chance to help her. I\u0027ll lose her forever. Just like Katherine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately she wished she could retract the comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his head, as if from an icy gust. She wished she could kiss him, like she had the last time he was here, when the whole world had momentarily shifted into perfect balance. But he\u0027d pulled away from her that time, and she\u0027d ended up feeling cheap and desperate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was so unlike John. He was a grounding wire, a steel-beamed foundation, and even though she knew she didn\u0027t need a man to feel safe, something about Chadwick made her want to fold up inside him, take off the mental armor she had to wear as a leader, a professional, a mediator, and let him protect her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the old days, back in high school—that\u0027s the very feeling that scared her away from romance with him. She could be his friend, but she\u0027d known instinctively that if they got involved, she would never become who she needed to be. She would become his shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd ever since then, she\u0027d been attracted to the wrong men—volatile, flashy ones, men who required her to be on her toes, to be calm and steady to balance them out. She remembered the day she\u0027d met John—her first year as a kindergarten teacher, at a Noe Valley school long since defunct. He\u0027d been dating a single mother whose child was in her class, and he\u0027d come to the school picnic in Golden Gate Park, stood against a eucalyptus tree, and started lighting Kleenexes on fire for the children—throwing them into the air as they ignited—a dangerous and wildly inappropriate magic show. She\u0027d known he was trouble, and known she would marry him, at almost the same moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was wrong with her, that she had to marry the wrong person before she could recognize the right one?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A woman called the bank,” Chadwick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“John has plenty of secretaries.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she could tell he wasn\u0027t comfortable with that explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about Norma, about the e-mail that had supposedly been sent from her computer. The past week, Ann had had her moments of doubt. Was Norma\u0027s friendship, her apparent forgiveness of Ann for stealing her husband, all a ruse leading up to this—one huge moment of revenge? But that was insane. Norma wasn\u0027t a plotter. She couldn\u0027t hide her anger that well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick said, “Did Talia Montrose have any connection with John?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Race Montrose warned Norma about the money. He knew this was going to happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing Race\u0027s name again made her shiver. It brought back the day she\u0027d pulled the dull black pistol out of his lunch bag, the smell of gun oil mixing with pencil shavings and bologna and mayonnaise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t see how,” she said. “John hates Race. The Montroses are the last people he would tell anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why did Mrs. Montrose send Race to Laurel Heights?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I told you—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Race is gifted. She wanted the best for him. And yet the morning before she was murdered, she sold her house, cashed in her checking account, and was getting ready to leave town, maybe without her son. Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn wanted to rise to Talia\u0027s defense. She knew that Talia, in her better moments, really did care for her son. But she also remembered the parent conference Talia had come to stoned, the many other conferences she\u0027d failed to make, the paperwork she never sent in. She remembered the time Talia had changed her phone number and forgotten to tell them—Race having an allergic reaction to a bee sting at school, an ambulance en route, and no emergency form on file from the mother. She remembered one particular argument between Talia and John, when they\u0027d brought the fifth-grade People in Profile show to a standstill—Mallory and Race on stage, dressed up like Susan B. Anthony and Booker T. Washington, while John and Talia yelled at each other in the back of the room about which of their children was the bad influence. It had been such a nightmare Ann had blocked out exactly what Talia had said that night, but she\u0027d been critical of Laurel Heights, as if she\u0027d put Race there against her will. Almost as if it had been someone else\u0027s idea. Two days later, John and Ann had had the final argument of their marriage. He had struck her, permanently shattering any illusion that they should stay together for Mallory\u0027s sake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Talia wasn\u0027t perfect,” Ann said. “But if you\u0027re thinking she would make any kind of deal with John, forget it. They hated each other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Race got a scholarship?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A half scholarship.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s what—eight thousand a year?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Roughly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She always pay on time?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t see what that\u0027s got to do with anything, but yes. Quarterly installments. Always cashier\u0027s check in the mail. It was never late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Her handwriting on the envelopes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My god, do you want me to dig one out of the files?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes stayed locked on hers, and she began to understand why he was asking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalia had never been late with a tuition check. Not once. And she\u0027d never shown up to pay in person. It was always a cashier\u0027s check, never a personal check.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Typed,” Ann remembered. “The envelopes were always typed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Postmark city?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re suggesting someone else was paying the bills for Race?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m suggesting someone was blackmailing John, taking his money, turning right back around and using it to fund Race\u0027s tuition at Laurel Heights. Talia went along with it, but I don\u0027t think it was her idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you wanted to punish John, really drive him over the edge, can you think of a better way than putting his daughter together with Race Montrose, after what happened to Katherine?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I stand by what I said before— Race did not corrupt Mallory.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But he knows something about the missing money. He tried to warn Norma. I think John wasn\u0027t sure who was blackmailing him. He guessed it was Talia. He finally got tired of it, scared enough for Mallory that he wanted to make a final settlement, so he offered to buy Talia\u0027s house for a huge amount of cash. Talia went for it, didn\u0027t bother to tell him she wasn\u0027t the blackmailer. The real blackmailer came along, got mad at her for making the deal, and killed her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But blackmail? Christ, Chadwick, blackmail for what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes fixed on the interior window, where the board members were now walking by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn didn\u0027t turn to look. She half expected Mark to walk in anyway and fire her on the spot, but no—Mark Jasper wouldn\u0027t confront her that way. He\u0027d call her tonight at home, chickenshit style, and tell her not to bother coming back in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The capital campaign money,” she told Chadwick. “If the Montroses found out that John was going to steal the school\u0027s money to discredit me—if they had some kind of proof, that could be what they were blackmailing him about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick pinched the lining of his coat. He said nothing, but Ann began to doubt her own theory. If Race\u0027s tuition had been paid for with blackmail money—then the blackmail had been going on for nine years. How could you pressure someone for nine years over a plan he hadn\u0027t yet executed? What leverage could anyone hold over John for that long, ever since . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered her conversation with the policeman from Oakland. “Katherine\u0027s necklace. It was left in Talia\u0027s blood. Some kind of message?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick\u0027s eyes were deadly still, their very brightness making them seem cold. “I intend to ask John, when I see him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about that necklace around Mallory\u0027s throat—remembered how hard it had been, letting her wear it after Katherine\u0027s death, but they\u0027d been afraid that if they forced her to take it off, it would damage her even more, take away the linchpin that let Mallory cope with what she\u0027d seen. Mallory had clung to it, insisting that Katherine gave it to her. And so, since Mallory was six years old, Ann hadn\u0027t been able to look at her own daughter once without thinking about the night of the suicide, without seeing the words Chadwick had inscribed on that silver charm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“John has ruined me,” she said. “The Montroses aren\u0027t the problem, Chadwick. They did not steal the school\u0027s money.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If Race knows who did, he may be in more danger than any of us. It may be why he brought that gun to school, to protect himself, and why he ran from the police. And if he told Mallory what he knows . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery joint in Ann\u0027s body had turned to ice. She went behind her desk, sat in her chair, and began shuffling papers—admissions forms, auction flyers, purchase orders—none meant much now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown the street, she could hear the whoop of the upper- and middle-schoolers coming back from PE at the Presidio, the unmistakable hormone-induced yells of adolescent girls—Mallory\u0027s classmates, her peers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The upstairs students will be coming in,” she said. “I need a few minutes alone. All right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick rose. “I\u0027ll find Race. I\u0027ll find out what\u0027s going on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried not to look at him, tried to concentrate on her paperwork as the middle school kids began to come in a few at a time, racing each other down the hall, playing tag and throwing backpacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just tell me one thing, Chadwick. Will you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited in the doorway—an enormous pillar of sand hovering on her periphery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The night of the auction,” she said, “before the police called—you were about to tell John and Norma, weren\u0027t you? You would\u0027ve told them about us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t look, but she could sense him struggling with what to say. Then he left, silently, his presence no longer blocking the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held his linen handkerchief up to her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe children were arriving in force now, streaming past her window, high on fruit juice and snack food, yelling and slamming their way into class. Teachers passed by, glancing into her office with concern, wondering if they would have a job tomorrow, or if they would spend Christmas reading the classifieds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnn felt as if she were moving, rather than them—that her office was racing down a road as dark and cold as the one back to the Mission, years ago—racing back toward her daughter where she sat curled in the black leather chair, staring at an empty doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChadwick found David Kraft sitting at the bottom of the school steps, lighting a cigarette for Kindra Jones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn,” Kindra told Chadwick. “Thought the cannibals ate you, man. We\u0027re out here getting run over by a herd of puberty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Things got complicated. You two know each other?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do now,” Kindra said. “The man has cigarettes.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cold-springs/page-26.html","bookId":2423,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:08 PM"}
