We get some transportation, and we get back on the road, and we make Kansas City, before we try any sleep,” Hainey swore. The pauses between his words kept time to the swinging of the Rattler. “And one way or another, we’ll get a new ship in Kansas City,” he vowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ol’ Barebones still owe you a favor?” Simeon grunted as the crate cracked against his kneecap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Barebones owes me a favor till he’s dead. Four or five miles, you think?” he asked the engineer without looking over at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At least,” Lamar admitted, sounding no happier about it than anyone else. “But it’s a miracle we got this close before the bird gave up the ghost. I could’ve sworn she’d never make it back into the air, but man, she made a liar out of me.” He kicked at the dirt and shifted his load to strain the other shoulder for awhile. “I never thought she’d fly again,” he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain knew what Lamar was fishing for, but he was too distracted or too exhausted to humor anybody, and he didn’t say anything in response. He only ground his jaw and stared into the long, stretch-limbed shadow that stomped in front of him, and he wondered if his arm would fall off before they reached Bonner Springs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Simeon’s free arm swung out to clap the engineer on the back, and he said, “That’s why we keep you around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not five other folks of any shade, in any state or territory could’ve got her back up into the sky with only a set of wrenches and a hammer, but I made her work, didn’t I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, you sure did,” Simeon said. “It was a nice job.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHainey grumbled, “Would’ve been nicer if the patches could’ve held another five miles.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLamar’s eyes narrowed, but he didn’t snap back except to say, “Would’ve been even nicer if nobody’d crashed our ride into Kansas in the first place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain’s nostrils flared, and even though the approaching evening had left the flatlands cool, a bead of sweat rolled down into the scar on his cheek. “Four or five miles,” he breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimeon said, “And then some food. If we don’t stop and eat, I’ll starve to death before we can grab a new bird anyhow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine,” Hainey shook his face and slung more sweat down to the dust. “But we eat on the road. Once we hit Bonner, how much farther is it to the big town, do you think? I’ve flown over it, but never walked it like this. You think twenty miles, maybe?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLamar shook his head and said, “Not that far, even. Maybe fifteen or sixteen. We can do it easy in a couple of hours, if we get horses good enough to pull us. We play our cards smart, and we might be in bed by midnight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Midnight,” the captain grunted. Then he said, “Hang on,” and stopped. “Other arm,” he suggested to Simeon, who nodded and complied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey switched, and Simeon said, “I’d like that a lot. I could sleep a week, easy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, you aren’t gonna.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We know,” Lamar said it like a complaint, but the look on the captain’s face made him to keep the rest to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun set fast behind them, and the world went golden. The sky was rich and yellow, then pale maroon; and before it went a royal shade of navy, the captain stopped to pull a lantern out of his satchel. They lit it and took turns holding it by their teeth, and by the ends of their fingers. When the last of the rose-pink rays had finally slipped down past the horizon line, the lone lantern made a rickety bubble of white around the three dark men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they trudged, coyotes called back and forth across the grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnakes rattled and scattered, winding their way into the night, away from the crushing boots of the heavily laden travelers; and while the crew staggered along the wheel ruts that passed for a rural road, sometimes overhead they could hear the mocking rumble of a dirigible passing through quickly, quietly, looking for a place to set down and spend the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy nine o’clock, they reached the town’s edge, and by ten they’d purchased a tiny, run-down stagecoach that was almost too old to roll, and they’d bartered two horses to pull it. The horses were only marginally younger and fresher than the coach itself, but they were well fed and rested, and they moved at a fast enough clip to bring the trio rolling into Kansas City by half past midnight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHainey drove the horses. Simeon sat beside him and smoked. Lamar stayed inside the cabin with the Rattler and the provisions, where he would’ve been happy to nap, except for the persistent, jerking bounce of the coach’s worn-out wheels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though their backs and arms still ached from the loads, the crew was refreshed by the gas lamps and the late workers who manned stores, transported goods, and swore back and forth at the gamblers and drunks. The prairie was a lonely place for three men too exhausted to talk (or even to bicker); and the city might not mean welcome, but it would warm them and supply them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey moved deeper into the heart of the place, keeping to themselves even as they drew the occasional curious eye. There were places in the west, as everywhere, where free black men could find no haven—but likewise, as everywhere, there were places where useful men of a certain sort could always find a reception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the central district, where the street lamps were fewer and farther between, the saloons were plentiful and the passersby became more varied. Indians walked shrouded in bright blankets; and through the window of the Hotel Oriental, Hainey saw a circle of Chinamen playing tiles on a poker table. On the corner a pair of women gossiped and hushed when the old coach drew near, but their business was an easy guess and even Simeon was too tired to give them more than a second glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong the wheel-carved dirt streets, Hainey, Simeon, and Lamar guided the horses beyond the prostitutes, the card-players, the cowboys and the dance hall girls who were late for work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd finally, when the road seemed ready to make a sudden end, they were at the block where Halliway Coxey Barebones ran a liquor wholesale establishment from the backside of a hotel. He also ran tobacco that the government had not yet seen and would never get a chance to tax, as well as the occasional wayward war weapon en route to a country either blue or gray—wherever the offer was best. From time to time, he likewise traded in illicit substances, which was how he had made the acquaintance of Croggon Hainey in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe side door of the Halliway Hotel was opened by a squat white woman with a scarf on her head and a carving knife in her hand. She said, “What?” and wiped the knife on her apron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHainey answered with comparable brevity, “Barebones.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked him up and down, then similarly examined the other two men. And she said, “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe captain leaned forward and lowered his head to meet her height. He minded the knife but wasn’t much worried about it. “Go tell him Crog is here to ask about prompt and friendly repayment of an old favor. Tell him Crog will wait in the lobby with his friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman thought about it for a second, and swung her head from side to side. “No. I’ll tell Barebones, but we don’t have no Negroes in here. You wait outside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stuck his foot in the door before she could shut it, and he told her, “I know what your sign says, and I know what your boss says. And it don’t apply to me, or to my friends. You go ask him, you’ll see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll go ask him, and you’ll wait here,” she insisted. “Or you can make a stink and I can make a holler—and you won’t get anywhere tonight but into a jail cell, or maybe into a noose. And how would you like that, boys?” Her eyebrows made a hard little line across her forehead and she adjusted her grip on the carving knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHainey did a full round of calculations in his head, estimating the value and cost of making a stand on the stoop of the side door at the Halliway Hotel. Under different circumstances, and in a different state, and with a night’s worth of rest under his belt he might have considered leaving his foot in the door; but he was tired, and hungry, and battered from a hard crash and hard travels. Furthermore he was not alone and he had two crewmen’s well-being to keep in mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr this is what he told himself as he wrapped a muffling leash around the insult and his anger, and he slipped his foot out of the door jamb so that the toad-shaped woman in the scarf could slam it shut. He said aloud, “We shouldn’t have to stand for it,” and it came out furious, lacking the control he wanted to show. So he followed this with, “It only adds to his debt, I think. If he can’t tell the kitchen witch to respect his guests, it ought to cost him. I’ll tack it to what he owes me, one way or another.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut neither of his crewmen made any reply, even to point out that Barebones already owed the captain his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor another five minutes they stood on the stoop, rubbing at their aching shoulders and tightening their jackets around their chests. Simeon fiddled with the tobacco pouch in his pocket and had nearly withdrawn it to roll up a smoke when the side door opened again. The chill-swollen wood stuck in the frame and released with a loud pop, startling the men on the stoop and announcing the man behind it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalliway Coxey Barebones was a short man, but a wide one. What remained of his hair was white, and the texture of wet cotton; and what remained of his eyesight was filtered through a pair of square, metal-rimmed spectacles. His hands and feet were large for a man of his understated size, his nose was lumpy and permanently blushed, and his waistcoat was stretched to its very breaking point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his arms and threw them up in greeting; but the effect somehow implied that he was being threatened. He said, “Hainey, you old son of a gun! What brings you and your boys to Missouri?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHainey mustered a smile as genuine as Halliway’s warm greeting and said, “A beat-up, crashed-down, worthless piece of tin and gas we never bothered to name.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/clementine-the-clockwork-century-1-1/page-6.html","bookId":1672,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:00 PM"}
