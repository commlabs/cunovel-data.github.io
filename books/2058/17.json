{"id":110425,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"\u003cp\u003eMy initial time with the Oneroi had been a mix of true and false dreams. As time went on - and I really had no way of saying how much of it did go on - the majority of them seemed to be true ones. They were either visitations of awful memories or more glimpses into my current life, meant to demoralize me and make me homesick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was still torn apart, still feeling more animal than human or succubus or...whatever. Yet, the fleeting pieces of rationality within me wondered at the sudden lack of handcrafted visions. One might argue the Oneroi were being lazy. They were just giving me recycled material, and whenever I did see my friends in the world, I got the impression that it was less a dream and more like the Oneroi flipping me onto a TV channel to make sure I stayed distracted and gave them something to feed off of. It almost felt like they were trying to keep me busy because...well, they were busy. But why? What had happened? What had Dante been about to tell Roman and the others? Was it enough to make the Oneroi pull some of their attention from me? Or were these simply more mind games meant to leave me in turmoil?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept hoping I\u0027d see a follow-up to what had happened with Dante, but the Oneroi had other parts of the life I\u0027d left behind to show me. Or, well, parts I hadn\u0027t left behind. Simone was still impersonating me, and the Oneroi wanted me to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdding insult to injury, she was helping Maddie and Seth with the wedding. The three of them were out cake shopping, and honestly, I was almost more surprised to find Seth there than I was Simone in her disguise. He\u0027d pretty much kept away from the wedding planning as much as possible, using the pretense that he was no good at decisions and was happy to let Maddie run things the way she wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t doubt the first part of what he said but wondered about the second. In my heart of hearts, the one that believed he was still in love with me, I secretly hoped he was passing it to Maddie just because he was indifferent to it all. I wanted to believe that he really didn\u0027t care about the planning because he didn\u0027t care about the wedding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was clear, however, that I cared. Or rather - Simone cared. Considering my reluctance at dress shopping, you would have thought Maddie might notice the sudden increase in zeal. Nope. Maddie was too caught up in her own bubble of happiness and welcomed \"my\" assistance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, the three of them set off on a cake adventure, visiting all the bakeries Maddie had compiled and ranked on a list pulled from hours of Internet research.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want it creamy,\" said Simone, licking icing off her fingers at a bakery in Belltown. Actually, it was more like sucking. \"This is a little too sugary.\" The threesome sat at a table where they had been provided with a plate of samples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the point,\" said Maddie. She was eating a bite-size piece of chocolate cake in a much less pornographic way. \"Mega sugar rush.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but if you get too much sugar, it just tastes grainy. You want it to slide right over your lips.\" She turned to Seth. \"Don\u0027t you think so?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth had taken a bite out of a piece of marble cake. \"It is kind of grainy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimone gave him a knowing smile, one that seemed to say, See? I know you better than anyone else in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth held her eyes for a moment, but his expression was unreadable. He turned toward Maddie. \"But we can do whatever you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no,\" she said, not sounding too disappointed. \"This is for both of us. I want it to be something you like too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth gave her a mischievous smile. \"Does it matter? It all gets shoved in the face anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaddie\u0027s eyes went wide. \"No, it doesn\u0027t! Don\u0027t even think about doing that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guess you won\u0027t know until the time comes, huh?\" His smile had grown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing him play with her made me (figuratively) squirm, but I took comfort in seeing a flash of annoyance in Simone\u0027s eyes. Maddie was succeeding where Simone couldn\u0027t. That was how it should be...or was it? Maddie\u0027s unwitting triumph over Simone meant she had...well, triumphed over me. Or had she? Simone looked like me but wasn\u0027t truly me. Damn. This was all so confusing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seth wouldn\u0027t do that,\" said Simone, resting her hand on his shoulder in what was supposed to be a friendly way. Maddie couldn\u0027t see it from her vantage, but Simone\u0027s fingers lightly brushed the back of his neck. \"Not if he wants a good honeymoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spoke lightly, but there was a sly undertone there. Having her sex life brought up in public made Maddie blush. Seth had shifted uncomfortably, but the reason was unclear. Simone\u0027s fingers? The mention of sex? Maybe both. Simone removed her hand, seeming innocent to all the world, except Seth and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaddie seemed eager to change the subject from the romantic goings-on of a honeymoon. \"I think you should at least pick the cake flavor,\" she said. \"I\u0027m choosing so much else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" said Seth. He still seemed uncomfortable. \"I don\u0027t care if you do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but she wants you to,\" said Simone. \"Come on, make one firm decision here. You can\u0027t go wrong. Maddie\u0027ll eat anything you pick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoaded statement. Neither Seth nor Maddie acted as though they read anything into it, but I had a feeling Simone had intended it as a reference to Maddie\u0027s very buxom figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly,\" said Maddie. \"What\u0027s your favorite flavor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet I can guess,\" said Simone. \"Chocolate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strawberry,\" said Maddie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLosers. It was vanilla.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vanilla,\" said Seth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaddie groaned. \"Naturally. Well, there\u0027s one decision made.\" She rose from the table. \"Let\u0027s try a few other places and get the rest of this taken care of. Not much left after this.\" They reached the door, and Maddie stopped to glance at Simone. \"Oh, hey. Will you do me a favor? Will you take Seth tux shopping?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" asked Seth. No neutral face now. He was shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaddie grinned. \"If you don\u0027t have a keeper, you\u0027ll show up at the church in a Billy Idol T-shirt. And it\u0027s bad luck if I go with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought that was just for the bride,\" said Seth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to be surprised,\" Maddie countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I\u0027ll go,\" said Simone, putting her arm around Seth again in that \"friendly\" way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaddie beamed, and the bakery faded away......transforming into Erik\u0027s store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik sat at a small table with Jerome and Roman, and - so help me - they were drinking tea. Even Jerome. Roman was visible, which made me think Jerome must have decided they no longer needed to fear the eyes of higher powers who might wonder why my \"human\" roommate kept tagging along with Seattle\u0027s archdemon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik was tapping his tea cup thoughtfully. \"If your theory is right, it would explain a lot.\" These words were directed at Roman. \"The dream quality of the visions. Mr. Jerome\u0027s complete inability to find her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerome\u0027s slightly arched eyebrow was the only indication of his displeasure over the word \"inability.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik continued, eyes on his cup as he pondered it all. \"And you\u0027re right...of all the creatures you suggested, Oneroi or Morphean demons make the most sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh! I thought in triumph to the Oneroi. How do you like that, bitches? My friends are on to you. No response came. No dissolving of the dream, as I would have expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why her?\" asked Roman irritably. I had a feeling he\u0027d taken credit for the dream idea, shielding Dante from Jerome\u0027s wrath. \"Why a succubus? Don\u0027t they only care about human dreams?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re tied to Nyx,\" pointed out Erik. Oh, yes. My friends were smart. Smarter than Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys put together. Maybe even Matlock too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The \u0027why\u0027 is irrelevant,\" said Jerome, speaking at last. \"Whether it\u0027s Oneroi or Morpheans is also irrelevant. If something\u0027s taken her to the world of dreams, she\u0027s completely inaccessible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoman frowned. \"Why? Can\u0027t you just go in there and pull her out now that you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerome gave his son a smile that almost, almost seemed genuinely amused. \"You\u0027re half-human, and it shows. Greater immortals can\u0027t go there. We don\u0027t dream. Only humans do. The way is barred to us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you have no hopes or imaginings of what might be,\" said Erik. His manner and tone clearly indicated he believed such a thing to be a failing for angels and demons. \"You need a soul to dream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if I\u0027m half-human, then I\u0027ll go there,\" said Roman obstinately, cutting off any retort Jerome might have given. \"I dream. So I can enter, right? And I can take on whatever\u0027s there.\" There was so much determination in his voice that I half believed he could take on an army of Oneroi right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have no idea what you\u0027re talking about,\" said Jerome. \"Clearly. Do you have any idea what the dream world is like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you?\" asked Roman dryly. \"I thought you couldn\u0027t go there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dreams are what fuel human existence. Dreams of power, love, revenge, redemption...the dreams of mankind are vast, uncountable. Humans dream both waking and asleep. Those hopes and fears are what put them at risk - they gamble their lives and souls on dreams. You go into the world of dreams, and it\u0027s like stepping into a blizzard. Every snowflake is some human imagining flitting by so quickly, you can\u0027t even see it. All you see is a blur, a tangle of longings and chaos. If Georgina is there, she is one of those snowflakes. You would never find her soul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeavy silence fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Roman said, \"That was like poetry, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he\u0027s correct,\" Erik told Roman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoman glanced between the two of them incredulously. \"So that\u0027s it? It\u0027s hopeless? You\u0027re giving up without even trying to find her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trying is hopeless,\" said Jerome. Demons might not dream the way humans did, but I suspected even he could picture what his superiors would do when they found out he\u0027d lost a succubus. \"Human magic could access the world of dreams, but it\u0027d do no good.\" He glanced at Erik, who nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone lost among all that couldn\u0027t be called back. Not even the strongest ritual could do it. Her soul would never hear anything we could muster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoman\u0027s face was a mixture of emotions. Anger. Disbelief. And...resignation. That didn\u0027t surprise me. Jerome\u0027s face did, however. He had stiffened at Erik\u0027s words, a spark of insight flashing in those cold, dark eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you could do the ritual, correct?\" he asked Erik. \"You\u0027re human. You\u0027re strong enough to open the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik eyed him warily. \"Yes...but by your own admission, it would achieve nothing. The connection you had to her was theoretically strong enough to possibly summon her back, but you can\u0027t enter. All we\u0027d have is a useless doorway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerome stood up abruptly. He glanced at Roman. \"Find your own way home.\" The demon vanished with a showy poof of smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I vanished back into the Oneroi\u0027s prison. They stood there in the dark, glowing from what they\u0027d taken from me. In dreams, though I suffered, I never felt the horrific effects they caused until I returned from them. That was when the agony, energy loss, and confusion hit me. Yet, this time, I wasn\u0027t completely lost to despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were wrong,\" I said. I tried to put some smugness in my voice, but it came out hoarse from my exhaustion. Good God. I was so, so tired. I guess dreaming didn\u0027t necessarily mean sleeping. \"My friends have figured it out. They know where I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs always, One and Two were nearly impossible to read. \"What makes you think that was a true dream?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcellent question. \"Gut instinct,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You believe you can trust it?\" asked One. \"After all this time? After so many dreams? How can you tell what\u0027s real and unreal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t. I knew when the memories were true - for now - but the \"real world\" scenes were harder. Maybe it wasn\u0027t my gut so much as my blind optimism that believed what I\u0027d just seen was real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo guessed my thoughts. \"You hope. And we\u0027ve fed that hope, making you think you have a chance. So you will wait. And wait. And wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was real,\" I said firmly, as though that would make it so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if it was,\" said One, \"it meant nothing. You saw for yourself. There is no way to bring you back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe that was the lie,\" I said. \"Maybe the rest was true. You mixed it. They figured out where I was, but you didn\u0027t show me the part where they learned how to rescue me. They\u0027re going to do that ritual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They will fail. Nothing can pull your soul from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wrong.\" I didn\u0027t even really know what I was saying. My essence felt like it was tearing apart, and really, the only thing I knew to do was to keep contradicting them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you are naive. You always have been. Lesser immortals carry that weakness over from their human days, and you\u0027re one of the worst. Our mother nearly used your weakness to free herself from the angels. Now it will be your downfall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean Nyx almost used it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Oneroi exchanged glances - very, very pleased ones. \"Your dream. Your fantasy,\" explained Two. \"The one she promised to show you if you freed her. You wanted so badly to believe it was possible, that you nearly gave in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, I didn\u0027t see them or that perpetual blackness. I was in a dream of my own creation, not theirs. The dream Nyx had sent to me over and over had been one of my future, with a home and a child - and a man. A man I loved whose identity remained a mystery. Nyx had never shown me the ending. Never shown me the man in the dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are so full of shit,\" I said. \"You claim Nyx shows the truth - the future. But how could that vision have been true if I\u0027m also supposed to be locked here for all eternity? They can\u0027t both be true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The future is always changing,\" said One. \"That was true when she showed it to you. Your path shifted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on! What\u0027s the point of having a vision of the future if it can change at any moment? That\u0027s not a truth or a lie. That\u0027s a guess. And I never believed her anyway. What she showed me was impossible - even if I wasn\u0027t here with you two assholes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will never know if it was,\" said Two. Then, he reconsidered. \"Actually it was possible, but you will live with the knowledge that it\u0027s a future that\u0027s been taken from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t take what I never had,\" I growled. \"Succubi can\u0027t have children. I could never have that kind of life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I didn\u0027t add was that one startling thing had come from the dream. In it, I\u0027d had two cats. At the time, I\u0027d only had one - Aubrey. Not long after, I\u0027d found Godiva, who was the other cat in the dream. Coincidence? Or had I truly been on the path to that future, only to have it ripped from me now? As always, the Oneroi could see into my heart and knew what I was thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to see?\" asked One.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The man,\" said Two. \"The man in the dream.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-shadows-georgina-kincaid-5/page-17.html","bookId":2058,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:59:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:59:24 PM"}
