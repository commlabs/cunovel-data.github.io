That was the last thing I heard before everything went hazy and the exercise bench reared up to hit me in the face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 16\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leila, can you hear me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my eyes, blinking. Vlad\u0027s face materialized in front of me, blurry at first, and then clear enough for me to notice that he looked concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I said, surprised at how weak my voice sounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will she be all right?\" I heard Ben ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All of you, leave,\" Vlad responded curtly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not nice,\" I mumbled. \"You should talk to them before you bite them, too. Common courtesy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brow went up, but he said nothing to that. I heard shuffling feet and then moments later, a door closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I faint?\" I asked, trying to remember what happened. I\u0027d been attempting to make Ben feel better about his former Minnie Mouse fetish, and then I saw something red . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. You were also bleeding from your ears, but it\u0027s stopped now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad\u0027s words were blunt, but they lacked the brusque tone he\u0027d used with Ben. I tried to sit up, but his features started to get blurry again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slowly,\" Vlad said. He grasped my shoulders, easing me into a sitting position. Then he slid behind me so that my back rested against his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t. I\u0027m all sweaty and bloody,\" I protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heavens, not sweat and blood,\" he replied mockingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI managed to smile. Smartass vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you anemic?\" Vlad asked, surprising me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. \"I don\u0027t think so, but I haven\u0027t been to a doctor in a long time, for obvious reasons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grasped my hand. Before I realized what he intended, he had my red-smeared fingers in his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop!\" I gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis other arm went around my torso, holding me in place against his chest. Between that and his grip on my hand, no way was I breaking free even if I had all my strength back, which I didn\u0027t. I could do nothing but wait as he slowly sucked on my fingers, his warm tongue snaking in between them to get every last drop of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not anemic,\" he said when he finally let go and I yanked my hand away from his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still felt rattled by what he\u0027d done, and it wasn\u0027t because I\u0027d found it repellent. \"You can tell from that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d be surprised by the things I can tell from tasting someone\u0027s blood,\" he replied in a lower, darker voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shivered, acutely aware that my neck was only an inch from his mouth. As if to accentuate that point, his jaw grazed my cheek. His stubble doesn\u0027t feel as rough as it looks, raced across my mind. Then again, it hadn\u0027t felt rough in that vision, either . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I can get up now,\" I said, trying to scoot away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arm stopped me before I got more than a few inches, drawing me back against that hard, heated chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop fidgeting, I\u0027m not going to bite you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Going to lick the blood off my head instead?\" I asked before cursing myself. Give him the idea, why don\u0027t you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t see his face, but I could almost feel him smile. \"No, not that, either. Has this ever happened to you before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing held against my will by a vampire? Sure, lots of times, I thought sardonically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leila . . .\" His voice held a note of impatience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought back, ruling out the times I\u0027d felt dizzy after falling during practice and banging my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Years ago, right around the time I met Marty. Once I fainted when he and I were performing. Then Marty started making me these awful-tasting health shakes, and I got better. Maybe I hadn\u0027t been getting enough vitamins before or something-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped, because Vlad had tensed. If I thought his chest felt hard before, now it was like leaning against steel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How often did he make you those shakes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t like the sound of his voice. Too controlled and pleasant-the same voice he used when he killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About once a week. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer, but pulled out a cell phone, dialing one-handed. With our close proximity, I heard the person answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" Marty\u0027s voice, tight with tension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you-?\" I began, but Vlad\u0027s hand sliced the air in the universal command for silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Martin,\" he said genially, \"did you forget to tell me something very important about Leila?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence, and then Marty\u0027s guarded \"I don\u0027t know what it could have been-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because she\u0027s right here, blood staining her hair after it leaked from her ears when she fainted,\" Vlad cut him off, his tone sharpening. \"Does that stir your memory?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t understand where Vlad was going with this. He clearly thought Marty had something to do with my fainting, but why? How?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy uneasiness wasn\u0027t abated when I heard Marty\u0027s heavy sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hoped she\u0027d built up enough of a resistance that she\u0027d be okay until I got back, but . . . well, f**k.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well what?\" I demanded, struggling to rise to my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVlad\u0027s arm tightened, keeping me pinned to his chest. \"He\u0027s been feeding you his blood in those shakes,\" he said flatly. \"That\u0027s why they tasted terrible to you. I should have picked up on that the other day when the scent from my bloody shirt reminded you of them, but I was preoccupied.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was stunned, my mind immediately rejecting the idea. I\u0027d seen what Marty put into those shakes! Carrots, celery, tomato juice, protein powder, some vitamin drops . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed vitamin drops in an unmarked bottle that he claimed he got from a friend who sold them on the side. I never questioned Marty about it. Why would I? I trusted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kid.\" Marty\u0027s voice flowed through the silence. \"I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy teeth ground together until my jaw ached. \"Hold the phone near my ear,\" I directed Vlad. \"Why?\" I asked as soon as it was close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarty sighed again. \"You were dying when we met. You didn\u0027t know it, but I could smell it. You\u0027re only human; you don\u0027t heal fast enough to undo the harm inflicted on your body from all that power inside you. I thought if I gave you a little bit of my blood every week, it might reverse the damage and even build up your resistance to the repercussions from your power. I was right about the first, but not the second, obviously.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that moment, I was glad Vlad hadn\u0027t let me get up because I felt like all the strength left my body. I\u0027d been dying? Could I believe him about that after he admitted he\u0027d been lying to me the entire four years we\u0027d known each other?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you tell me this before?\" My voice sounded strong, at least. Anger helped with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to, but I was afraid you\u0027d say no.\" It sounded like Marty sniffed even though he didn\u0027t need to breathe. \"You know what happened with Vera. When we met, you reminded me so much of her that I couldn\u0027t . . . I wouldn\u0027t let you die, too.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-burned-night-prince-1/page-25.html","bookId":2011,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:47:47 PM"}
