A small group of humans, no more than four or five, against a dozen or more of the living dead. The soldiers have guns and are firing openly on their enemies, but unless the bullets strike their heads and rip the zombies\u0027 brains apart, they don\u0027t do any real damage. And the zombies aren\u0027t giving the soldiers the time or space to squeeze in many clear headshots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy first instinct is to try to help the soldiers. It doesn\u0027t matter that they\u0027ve been keeping me captive, or that they\u0027ve been deliberately starving me for the last few days. I feel compelled to help the living.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zombies have the soldiers surrounded. I start towards them, shouting, trying to distract the undead killers. I\u0027m not sure how I plan to help the humans, but at least I can fight off the zombies without fear of being infected. Maybe I can buy the soldiers time to retreat to safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the reviveds put an early end to my half-formed plans. They press in close, dig in teeth and fingers, and it\u0027s all over before I hit the scene. They leave the humans before they fully turn, somehow knowing they\u0027ve done enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldiers writhe on the ground and scream for help or mercy, but there\u0027s nothing anyone can do for them now. One puts a gun to his head and ends the nightmare before it can claim him. The others suffer on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zombies bunch together in front of me and sniff the air, pressing forward dangerously. I remember what happened during the experiment. The reviveds don\u0027t react to zom heads unless we attack them. It\u0027s hard, but I force myself to stand calmly as they circle me, fingers flexing, nostrils dilated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey decide I\u0027m one of them, lose interest in me and press on, moving with purpose. Soon I\u0027m left with the soldiers, who are all vomiting and transforming. I can hear bones forcing their way out through fingers and toes, teeth thickening and lengthening. Turning my back on the doomed, screaming men, I make for zom HQ, hoping to find answers or safety there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve been able to patrol the corridors by myself. Under normal circumstances I wouldn\u0027t get very far, but virtually all of the doors are open. The security system has either crashed or been hacked. There\u0027s nothing to hold me back. But that means there\u0027s nothing to hold back the zombies either. Or that grisly clown. Mr. Dowling could be lurking in any of the rooms that I pass or around any of the corners that I come to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there\u0027s no sign of the clown. I scope lots of zombies, and a few soldiers and scientists running for their lives, but that\u0027s all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m close to zom HQ when a Klaxon starts to wail. The high-pitched sound is torturous and I collapse to my knees, choking with pain. Clasping my hands over my ears doesn\u0027t help. I feel like my head is about to split. I see zombies falling like ninepins, moaning and convulsing. It looks like the revolt has been quashed. Some bright spark has come to the rescue. It\u0027s probably for the best. As much as I hate the crew here for what they\u0027ve done to me, I don\u0027t want to see them all slaughtered. I\u0027ll just wait, ride out the pain as best I can, and put up no resistance when they come to take me back to my...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Klaxon dies away as swiftly as it blared into life. The zombies rise and shake their heads. They snarl accusingly at the ceiling, then press on in search of fresh victims, back in business, as hungry as ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stagger on until I find zom HQ, but the door here is closed and doesn\u0027t open when I push. I pound on it and roar out names. \"Rage! Reilly! Tiberius!\" But nothing happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not sure what to do now. I back away from the door, staring at it sullenly. An undead woman with one arm staggers past. She stops and turns, eyes widening with delight, lips splitting into an eager smile. Then a bullet rips through her forehead and tears her brain to shreds. She collapses with a soft wheezing noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance over my shoulder and spot Reilly and Dr. Cerveris jogging towards me. Gokhan, Peder and Cathy are with them. Reilly looks scared but in control. Dr. Cerveris just looks furious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you get out of your cell?\" the doctor snaps as they draw level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The clown opened my door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone gapes at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What bloody clown?\" Reilly grunts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Dowling.\" I look around. \"Nobody else saw him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s started to hallucinate,\" Dr. Cerveris huffs. \"That\u0027s common among revitalizeds in the final stages of consciousness. We should leave her. She could regress at any time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re all in bad shape,\" Reilly says, pointing to the others, who are shaking and dizzy-looking. \"If we\u0027re going to try to save the rest, we might as well save B too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well,\" Dr. Cerveris mutters. \"But if I give the command, blow her brains out and don\u0027t stop to think about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor steps forward, presses his fingers to the panel on the zom HQ door, then puts an eye up to the retinal scanner. The door slides open and he looks inside. \"Nobody home,\" he says, closing the door again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t we hole up in there?\" Peder asks. \"The zombies couldn\u0027t get in if we shut the door behind us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course they could,\" Dr. Cerveris barks. \"Members of staff have been turned. We know from past tests that certain operational memories remain among reviveds. Some of the soldiers and medics might recall what they need to do to open locked doors, and if they had clearance when they were alive, they still have it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what are we going to do?\" I growl. \"Run around like slasher-movie fodder until the zombies get us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First we fetch the others,\" Reilly says as we pad down the corridor, following the animated Dr. Cerveris. \"Then we lock ourselves into a room that requires a digital code. The reviveds won\u0027t be able to recall a string of numbers - their memories aren\u0027t that strong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How come you\u0027re bothering with us?\" Cathy asks as we run. \"Did Josh tell you to help us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t seen him,\" Reilly says. \"I don\u0027t know if he\u0027s still alive. But it\u0027s our job to protect you. We\u0027re under attack. An outside crew has disabled our system and freed the reviveds, and their forces are still active. I thought we were safe when the Klaxon kicked in, but obviously they got to that too. I don\u0027t think they\u0027re interested in the reviveds - they can find more of them anywhere - so they must be after you guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve put too much work into this project to see it hijacked now,\" Dr. Cerveris says petulantly. \"Once we\u0027ve run off these invaders, I\u0027ll track down whoever was responsible for the attack and flay their flesh from their hides.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you aren\u0027t helping us out of humanitarian concern?\" I jeer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not,\" Dr. Cerveris says. \"You aren\u0027t human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head admiringly. He might be a son of a bitch, but at least he stays true to himself, even during a crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe pick up Tiberius from his cell - it\u0027s quiet down his corridor and he had no idea that anything was amiss - then push on. A couple of corners later, we run into a pair of reviveds. They go wild when they catch the scent of Reilly and Dr. Cerveris. They hurl themselves at the humans. Reilly fires but misses. Before the zombies can take him, we wrestle them to the ground and hold them there while Reilly takes aim and shoots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate doing this, helping him kill, but we have no choice. It\u0027s Reilly and Dr. Cerveris or the reviveds. And while my sympathies should lie with the zombies who\u0027ve been imprisoned and maltreated, I can\u0027t stop thinking of myself as one of the living.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark\u0027s cell is next on our route. The door\u0027s open but he\u0027s cowering inside, hunched over in a corner, tears streaming down his face. (Those new drops are miraculous. Even with everything else that\u0027s going on, I feel a stab of jealousy and wonder why the rest of us have been denied them.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mark!\" Reilly barks. \"Get your arse in gear. We\u0027re moving out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark looks up and shakes his head. He opens his mouth to say something, but nothing emerges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" I ask, stepping towards him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave the little worm,\" Cathy grunts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Gokhan sneers. \"He\u0027s acting like a baby, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s coming with us,\" Dr. Cerveris says with unusual warmth. He shoves past me and crouches by Mark\u0027s side. \"Come on, Mark. We have to get out of here. We\u0027re going to take you to a safe place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark stares at the scientist. A shadow flickers across his eyes and for a moment it looks to me as if he blinked. But of course that\u0027s impossible. The drops are good, but nothing can be that good, not for a zom head with paralyzed eyelids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he out there?\" Mark whimpers, his gaze shooting towards the open doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\" Dr. Cerveris frowns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark\u0027s gloved right hand is twitching by his side, fingers drumming the floor. But when I steal a closer look, I realize he isn\u0027t drumming - he\u0027s squashing. There are lots of dark smudges on either side of him. They could be ink blots, but I know that they\u0027re not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re smeared spiders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You saw the clown,\" I say, and Mark\u0027s eyes lock on mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You saw him too?\" he gasps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod heavily. \"Mr. Dowling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The button,\" Mark croaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t a hallucination. I\u0027d started to doubt myself, but now I know for sure that my giggling visitor was real. There\u0027s no time to wonder at it, though. We have to get out of here and find sanctuary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on.\" I take Mark\u0027s hand and haul him to his feet. \"We need to get away before the clown comes back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat puts a rocket under Mark\u0027s arse and he bounces away from me and is first out the door. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/zom-b-underground-zom-b-2/page-18.html","bookId":2451,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:24:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:24:37 PM"}
