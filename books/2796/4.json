She went to the board. Carefully she printed, under BEAR, the word FLAMINGO.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Felicia Ann turned to the class and unfolded her paper.

She grinned. Then she went back to her desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Pidgeon stood up. \"Class,\" she said, \"we have time for just one more fable before lunch, and then we\u0027ll do some more tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nicholas?\" she asked. \"Would you like to be the final fable today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Nicholas, looking miserable, shook his head no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Mrs. Pidgeon said, \"I can see that three of you—Chelsea, Malcolm, and Tyrone—are eager to have a turn.

Grudgingly, Nicholas stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a grin Tyrone made his way to the front of the room. He carried no paper, but he had a shiny pie tin in his hand, and when he reached the front of the room, he hung the pie tin, which had a string attached to it in two places, around his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My fable is—\" he began, his sneakers already tapping on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Write your animal on the board!\" Chelsea called. But Tyrone only grinned and moved his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead and yell it but I dunno how to spell it,\"he chanted, \"can\u0027t write it on the list cuz my spelling might be dissed, so I tell the story \u0027bout it and if you wanna you can shout it...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole class began to tap their feet and hum along with Tyrone.

It opened, and Mr. Leroy, the principal, appeared. He was wearing a tie that had candy canes on it, and some holly berries. \"I heard some strange sounds from this classroom,\" he said, smiling, \"and I suspected that the famous Tyrone was performing. May I sit in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tiptoed over and sat down at Tyrone\u0027s empty desk. Mr. Leroy was a tall man, and sitting at a child\u0027s desk made his legs fold in an odd way, with his knees sticking up, but he never seemed to mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a fable,\" Tricia whispered to him from the next desk. \"Tyrone\u0027s doing a fable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyrone continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Leroy don\u0027t be bitter, gonna hear about this critter, Teeee rex, Teeee rex...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Teeee rex, Teeee rex,\" the class chanted.

Mrs. Pidgeon, laughing, said, \"Great as always, Tyrone. But haven\u0027t you forgotten something? What does a fable always have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gettin\u0027 to that,\" Tyrone explained.

Sometimes the teachers all sat together at a separate table, or even ate their lunch in the teachers\u0027 room. But today Mrs. Pidgeon was eating with the children.
