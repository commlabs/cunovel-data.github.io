It was a shabby brick house, between Seventh and Eighth avenues. It was occupied by clerks and salesmen employed, like Sam, on Eighth avenue, and the price and accommodations were both adapted to the small salaries which, as a rule, they received. The hall was covered with oilcloth, dirty, and in places worn away, while the stair-carpeting was of the same material. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Sam opened the door with a latchkey, and led the way upstairs.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Come up to my room, Joshua,” he said. “While you are fixing your hair, I’ll go down and let Mrs. Jones know you are here.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Sam’s room was a hall bedroom on the third floor. It was barely large enough for a narrow bedstead, a trunk, a chair, and a washstand. There was no bureau, and no room for any; but in place, there were nails to hang his clothes upon just opposite the bed. It fell below Joshua’s anticipations, being quite inferior to the room he occupied at home. He had supposed that Sam, who had strutted about Stapleton the summer before, was handsomely situated. So it was with a feeling of disappointment that he regarded the small room, the thin, cheap carpet, the common wooden bedstead, and untidy washstand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It’s rather small,” said Sam, in a tone of apology, “but there’s a larger room on this floor. We will take it together. I’ll speak to Mrs. Jones about it. There’s a brush and comb; you can be fixing your hair, while I run down and see about a seat at the table for you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Joshua proceeded to arrange his toilet, while Sam did as proposed. He returned in a couple of minutes and announced his success.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The old lady’ll be glad enough to take you,” he said. “We can have the other room. We’ll go into it after dinner.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “After dinner?” repeated Joshua, who had been accustomed to regard the third meal as supper.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, we always have dinner at this hour,” explained Sam. “We never take supper except Sunday evening.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That seems strange, Sam.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, you’ll get used to it very soon.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Don’t you eat anything in the middle of the day?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We take lunch then. You’ll find New York a different sort of a place from Stapleton.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Joshua was ready to believe this. He was not used to it yet, but had no doubt he should like it after a while.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now, if you are ready, we will go down to dinner.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The dining-room proved to be in the front basement. Three or four young men were already seated at the table, while a red-haired girl was waiting upon them. The mistress of the boarding house was a thin, tired-looking woman, who, to judge from her appearance, found her business rather a wearing one.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Mrs. Jones, Mr. Drummond,” introduced Sam.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am glad to see you, Mr. Drummond,” said Mrs. Jones; and she really was glad, for a new boarder was a welcome addition to her household. “Sit down there, if you please, next to Mr. Crawford.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Joshua took his seat as directed, and the waitress came to receive her orders.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Will you have roast beef or roast lamb?” she asked of Sam.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Beef for me,” answered Sam. “What will you have, Joshua?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The same,” said Joshua.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I suppose it is useless to say that Mrs. Jones did not keep a first-class boarding house. The fare she furnished to her boarders was considerably inferior to that at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, or a good many other hotels of lower standing; but this was a point in which Joshua was not likely to be disappointed. His father, as has been explained in the preceding volume, was a man so fond of money that he always furnished a very mean table, and neither he nor any of his family had ever been in danger of gout or dyspepsia. So to Joshua the fare at Mrs. Jones’ boarding house seemed excellent. His wanderings had given him quite an appetite, and he did substantial justice to the food before him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When they rose from the table Mrs. Jones said, “I will come upstairs immediately, Mr. Crawford, and show you and your friend the large room next to yours.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, Joshua, how do you like the feed?” asked Sam, as they were going upstairs.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It’s very good,” answered Joshua, in a tone of satisfaction. “Do you always have as good a dinner?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, always.

Of course, board’s much higher here than in the country.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is it?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Certainly.

The carpet was the same quality as that in Sam’s smaller room, but there was a little more furniture, and there were two windows. Two cheap prints in pine frames gave an elegant, artistic look to the apartment. Joshua was not, however, as favorably impressed with it as with the dinner.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How’ll this do, Joshua?” said Sam.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very well, I think.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We shall want to sleep here to-night, Mrs. Jones,” said Sam.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It shall be ready, Mr. Crawford.

Joshua had got into dangerous company, and under the auspices of Sam Crawford the fund of money, which he considered as so large, was not likely to last long. Could his father have looked in upon him, and realized the manner in which the money he had scraped together was likely to be expended, he would have been angry and horror-stricken.
