The peace of moments, the peace between eyeblinks, the peace of the void.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will not give up\", he repeated, and the words seemed a wonder to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI CONTROL THEM ALL. I BREAK THEM BEFORE ME. YOU HAVE LOST, CHILD OF HUMANKIND.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you think that\", Rand whispered into the darkness, \"then it is because you cannot see\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoial was panting hard when he returned to the northern end of the Heights. He gave the news to Mat, about how Lan had fought so bravely before he went down, taking Demandred with him. Loial’s report affected Mat deeply, as it did all members of his army, particularly the Borderlanders who had lost a king, a brother. There was a disturbance among the Sharans as well; somehow, news of Demandred\u0027s death was already percolating through their ranks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat forced down his grief. That wasn’t what Lan would have wanted. Instead, Mat raised his ashandarei. \"Tai’shar Malkier!\" he screamed with all the force he could. \"Lan Mandragoran, you bloody wonderful man! You did it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis shouts rang in the silence as he charged toward the Shadow armies. Shouts rang behind him: \"Tai’shar Malkier!\" Shouts from all nationalities, all peoples, Borderlander and not. They surged across the Heights alongside Mat. Together, they attacked the stunned foe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 39\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose Who Fight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYOU CANNOT FATHOM IT, CAN YOU? Rand demanded of the darkness. IT IS BEYOND YOU. YOU BREAK US, AND STILL WE FIGHT! WHY? HAVEN’T YOU KILLED US? HAVEN’T YOU RUINED US?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYOU, the Dark One replied. I HAVE YOU.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand stepped forward. In this place of nothing, the Pattern seemed to swirl around him like a tapestry. HERE IS YOUR FLAW, SHAITAN—LORD OF THE DARK, LORD OF ENVY! LORD OF NOTHING! HERE IS WHY YOU FAIL! IT WAS NOT ABOUT ME. IT’S NEVER BEEN ABOUT ME!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was about a woman, torn and beaten down, cast from her throne and made a puppet—a woman who had crawled when she had to. That woman still fought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was about a man that love repeatedly forsook, a man who found relevance in a world that others would have let pass them by. A man who remembered stories, and who took fool boys under his wing when the smarter move would have been to keep on walking. That man still fought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was about a woman with a secret, a hope for the future. A woman who had hunted the truth before others could. A woman who had given her life, then had it returned. That woman still fought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was about a man whose family was taken from him, but who stood tall in his sorrow and protected those he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was about a woman who refused to believe that she could not help, could not Heal those who had been harmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was about a hero who insisted with every breath that he was anything but a hero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was about a woman who would not bend her back while she was beaten, and who shone with the Light for all who watched. Including Rand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was about them all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw this, over and over, in the Pattern arrayed about him. Rand walked through eons and ages, his hand passing through ribbons of the Patterns light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHERE IS THE TRUTH, SHAITAN, Rand said, taking another step forward, arms out, woven Pattern spreading around them. YOU CANNOT WIN UNLESS WE GIVE UP. THAT’S IT, ISN’T IT? THIS FIGHT ISN’T ABOUT A VICTORY IN BATTLE. TAKING ME . . . IT WAS NEVER ABOUT BEATING ME. IT WAS ABOUT BREAKING ME.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHAT’S WHAT YOU’VE TRIED TO DO WITH ALL OF US. IT’S WHY AT TIMES YOU TRIED TO HAVE US KILLED, WHILE OTHER TIMES YOU DIDN’T SEEM TO CARE. YOU WIN WHEN YOU BREAK US. BUT YOU HAVEN’T. YOU CAN’T.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe darkness trembled. The nothingness shook, as if the arches of the heavens themselves were cracking. The Dark One’s shout was defiant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the void, Rand continued forward, and the darkness trembled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI CAN STILL KILL, the Dark One bellowed. I CAN STILL TAKE THEM ALL! I AM LORD OF THE GRAVE. THE BATTLE LORD, HE IS MINE. ALL ARE MINE EVENTUALLY!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand stepped forward, hand stretched out. In his palm sat the world, and upon that world a continent, and upon that continent a battlefield, and upon that battlefield two bodies on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat fought, Tam at his side with sword out. Karede and the Deathwatch Guard joined them, then Loial and the Ogier. The armies of a dozen nations and peoples fought, many joining him as he rushed across the plateau.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were outnumbered three to one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat fought, bellowing in the Old Tongue. \"For the Light! For honor! For glory! For life itself!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slew one Trolloc, then another. Half a dozen in moments, but he felt he was fighting with the surf itself. Wherever he struck down blackness, more took its place. Trollocs moving in the shadows, lit only by the occasional lantern or burning arrow stuck in the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Trollocs didn’t fight as one. We can break them, Mat thought. We have to break them! This was his chance. Push now, while the Sharans were dazed at Demandred\u0027s fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE SON OF BATTLES. I WILL TAKE HIM. I WILL TAKE THEM ALL, ADVERSARY. AS I TOOK THE KING OF NOTHING.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood and Bloody ashes! What was that nothingness in his head? Mat beheaded a Trolloc, then wiped his brow, Karede and the Deathwatch Guards covering him for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat could feel the battlefield in the night. There were a lot of Trollocs and Sharans, so many of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are too many!\" Arganda called from nearby. \"Light, they’ll overwhelm us! We need to fall back! Cauthon, can you hear me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can do this, Mat thought. I can win this battle. An army could defeat superior numbers, but Mat needed momentum, an opening. A favorable toss of the dice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand stood above the Pattern and looked down at the fallen men in a land where hope seemed to have died. \"You have not been watching closely enough. About one thing, you are wrong. So very wrong . . \".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCornered and alone, a boy huddled in a cleft in the rock. Horrors with knives and fangs—the Shadow itself made flesh—dug at his hiding place, reaching with nails like knives and ripping his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerrified, crying, bloodied, the boy raised a golden horn to his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat squinted, the battle seeming to dim around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo very wrong, Shai’tan, Rand’s voice whispered in Mat’s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the voice was no longer in Mat’s mind. It could be heard distinctly by everyone on the battlefield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat one you have tried to kill many times, Rand said, that one who lost his kingdom, that one from whom you took everything . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLurching, bloodied from the sword strike to his side, the last king of the Malkieri stumbled to his feet. Lan thrust his hand into the air, holding by its hair the head of Demandred, general of \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-279.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
