One day, she’ll start to open the door and it’ll take off without her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile at this morning’s shenanigans but I quickly sober.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime to set up a meet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe store is still crowded with potential blazer buyers. A lot of them see the price and slowly back away. Which I can’t say I blame them; it’s a lot to pay for one item.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi and Lola are both at the store today because Nat asked for the morning off to get a physical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked if everything was okay and she said she thinks it is but no harm in a check-up. Which I immediately approved of. You don’t mess around with your health.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk out of the store room and find Mimi at the counter with an irate looking She-Devil Sissy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSon of a Big Mac!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust when I thought I was having a good morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk over and ask Mimi, “There a problem, Meems?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi doesn’t take her eyes off Sissy but replies, “Just fine boss lady. Sissy here wants to buy a blazer. I told her the price and she freaked.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, woe is she! Cry me a damn river!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis woman is becoming a permanent pain in my backside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn to Sissy and say, “I’m sorry, Sissy. The blazers are expensive but they are what they are. Take it or leave it. Do not bring drama to the store.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSissy flips her platinum blonde hair over one shoulder and replies “Fine. Two hundred and fifty dollars for a blazer, I must be out of my mind. Whatever. Wrap it up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly buckets!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi charged her sixty dollars more than I planned on charging. I’ll tell her off later. Not that she’ll give a flying poop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi starts wrapping up her purchase when I remember something and tell her, “Sissy, there is absolutely no refund on this item. You bring it back and it won’t be like last time. I won’t be nice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSissy glares at me. I take this as an okay and turn to head back to the store room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI halfway there when I hear Sissy yell out, “How did you do it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn and take a few steps towards the counter. I ask, “How did I do what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe makes an exasperated noise. She says slowly, “Nik. I worked on him for months and ended up with zip. How did you get him? You pregnant or somethin’?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nerve of this woman!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decide to be a little cruel. Which is never nice but this woman is insinuating the only way I could have Nik is if he got me pregnant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI say acidly, “No, Sissy. I’m just not you. Which, not surprisingly, Nik likes.” I lean closer and whisper, “Nik loves me, Sissy. HeHH told me I’m it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see her face flash painfully and without waiting for a response, I turn and head back to the store room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t like doing that. Sometimes I wish my mouth had a backspace key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat comes back in to the store sometime after three. She doesn’t stop to look at anyone, just walks on through to the store room and ignores the greetings we all yell out to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s odd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat is a people person. Even on the worst day she’s at least mildly social. I decide to investigate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk over to the store room and just as I’m about to knock I hear muffled crying come from behind the closed door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart clenches painfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if the doctor’s appointment went bad? What if she’s really sick? Or even dying?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face pales and I start to sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo way in hell I’m losing Nat without a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI barge into the store room, close the door behind me and lock it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer back is to me and she’s quieted down a little but I can hear her sniffle. It takes a lot for Nat to cry. She isn’t a sooky baby like me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk over to her and put an arm around her. She places her head on my shoulder and howls out uncontrollable sobs. Of course, this means I cry quietly right along with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill sobbing she sputters, “I can’t…I can’t have them. I thought I was but then I wasn’t and now I can’t have them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh, Wha…?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold her and coo to her until she calms and I try to decipher what she just said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s the matter, honey?” I ask quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe straightens a little and replies, “I thought I was pregnant. Ghost would’ve been the father.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI balk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh Em Gee!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNat being pregnant would be awesome! She absolutely adored kids. I know she wants a lot of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI say, “Well, honey, that’s nothing be upset about. That’s…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe interrupts me “No. It would’ve been fine. I would’ve been happy. But the doctor did an ultrasound. I’m not pregnant. But he found over eighty cysts on my ovaries, Tina. I have PCOS.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face falls and I put a hand to my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe isn’t pregnant. They did find something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tries to be strong but her lip is quivering. “The doctor says it’s a high probability that I won’t be able to have children. Like, ever.” She looks at me through glassy eyes. “I’ll never have kids, Tina. And that sucks so bad. Eighty fucking cysts. That’s why my period didn’t come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God. You totally suck sometimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cry right along with her. I pull her close and coo, “Oh, honey. There are options for people who can’t have children. We’ll research everything we can. We’ll call specialists and doctors. We’ll go online and talk to other people with PCOS. We’ll figure it out! I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods into me. After a minute I gasp lightly and smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI whisper, “I’ll have your baby for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer body stiffens and she lifts her head. Her pretty face is distorted by sorrow and I don’t like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whispers back, “You’d do that for me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, “Yes. Absolutely. No question. I don’t think I’d do it for anyone else but you’re my sister. So, yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bursts into tear again and we cry together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMourning her loss. Celebrating our friendship. Together, like always.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake that, PCOS. You can’t win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m finishing some paperwork when I hear the familiar clip clop in the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy baby has come for a visit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk to the office door and just as I get there, I see her smiling face grace the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling big, I step closer, grip her hips and lean down to kiss her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI place slow, sensual kisses on her neck and she sighs. Her hands move to my shoulders and squeeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill working on her neck, I ask, “Baby, you need something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stills for a second then replies, “You know, all of a sudden, I can’t remember.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckle and squeeze her hips. She pushes at me slightly til we’re just inside my office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whispers, “I need you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lift my head and flash her the dimple. I say, “You got me, baby. You’re my heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTina gets a gooey look on her face and puts a hand on her chest. She shakes her head and straightens. She steps closer to me and says slowly, “No, babe. I need you. Like, now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, hot damn!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy baby needs me! I like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walks backwards, closes the office door and locks it, smiling a sultry smile all the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m already harder than a rock. Tina and I have had sex a few times now and it’s always bangin’ but she’s never come to me for a nooner. I really like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walks up to me and undoes my belt and zipper so I’m open and bare. Steps back a few steps, lifts her skirt and slowly lowers her panties. Then walks over to my desk, puts her hands on it, turns her face to me and lightly shakes her perfect ass at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck me! It’s on!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe giggles when I run to her. I lift her skirt and kneel behind her. I take my time kissing her perfect behind. I squeeze and lightly spank her cheeks. They turn rosy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand and she turns to me. She lays wet, sexy kisses on my neck and softly sucks at my pulse point which feels amazing. My cock jumps. She lowers herself til her head is lined up with my crotch. She palms my hard length, stroking it up and down before taking me into her mouth. She works me so good. My eyes roll back and I groan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is Sexy Tina. I love all my Tina’s but I really like Sexy Tina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe takes me deep into her mouth and hollows her cheeks on the release. She does this repeatedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck, I’m going to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, no you don’t!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hands under her arms and lift her. She gasps when I turn her and push her a little forcefully onto the desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, Tina is wearing heels, otherwise this never would work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lift her skirt, bend my knees a little, hold my cock and prod gently til I find her entrance. I carefully work my cock up and down her slit, coating it with her arousal. When Tina pants, I know it’s time. I slowly drive the head of my cock into her pussy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo fuckin’ tight!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’d think I’d get used to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNope, no getting used to perfection. My baby is perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push myself in inch by inch. I hold Tina’s hips and pull her back so we’re ass to crotch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan’t get a better feeling than this. No ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI still for a moment before pulling back slightly and thrusting back into her. Hard. She moans and I can’t stop myself from gripping her hips and fucking her hard. I pound into her. I look down and see her rosy ass which is jiggling with every thrust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, man. So good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ask ,“You like that, baby?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pants her reply ,“Ohhhhhh. Yes, Niki, I love it. Faster, baby, I’m close.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love when she calls me Niki.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pound into her harder and faster. I feel her tighten around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe feels like heaven when she comes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel my own release dawning. Tina grinds her ass back into me. She moans quietly and I feel her contract and release around my swelling cock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that’s that. I grip her hips tight and pull her back into me. I groan as I jerk my own release and fill her with my seed. Tina rests her head on my desk and I hold onto her. We both pant softly and I feel Tina’s body shake. I look at her sideways turned face and she’s laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe says, “That was my first nooner. Ever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chuckle as I slowly pull out of her. I ask, “I like being your first at something. How was it, baby?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill bent over my desk, I hear her sigh and she whispers, “The best. Everything with you is the best.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clean myself before I bring some tissue and wipe her clean. I ball up her panties and put them in my pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decide it’s time to bring up a concern I’ve had for a little while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull Tina to stand and hold her tight. She wraps her arms tightly around my waist, sighs and rests her head on my chest. I smile. This is what love is. Simple pleasures and all that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clear my throat and ask, “Tina, sweetheart, should I be preparing for a baby?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTina’s limp form goes so rigid I think she might just take off like a rocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe replies quietly ,“No, Nik. I have a birth control device in my uterus and it’s good for another two years. But while we’re on the subject, when’s the last time you were tested?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fair question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI answer truthfully, “After the last time I slept with Sissy. I’m clean as a whistle, sweetheart.” I smile down at her worried face. “I’ve never had sex without a condom, baby. You’re the first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes widen and she whispers, “Really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reply, “Really really.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles up at me. I’m just about to kiss her when she jerks back and says, “I’m clean too by the way! I got tested after…after him. And I’m squeaky clean. And no. No babies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat last statement sounded a bit too sharp for my liking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grip her tight and rub her back. I ask, “But you want children someday, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe backs away from me. Her face voids and I get the feeling I’m not going to like her answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head, swallows hard and says slowly, “No, Nik. I decided not to have children. And no, there is no changing my mind about it. This wasn’t a decision I made easily. Believe me.” She finishes on a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want kids. I was thinking that Tina would be the one to give them to me. This is a blow to the gut for me. I was excited at the prospect of children and I wanted to be a daddy to Tina’s beautiful children. It’s all part of the fantasy in my head. Tina is my wife and we live together in a nice house with three kids and a dog. The dog was actually Bear but that isn’t an option now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m stunned speechless. I don’t know what to say. I’m so disappointed right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI obviously don’t hide my disappointment well. I catch Tina’s shining eyes and she says, “I understand if this changes things for you. I really do. Just think about it and let me know if this is still a relationship you want to be a part of. Because I won’t have children. Or adopt. I… I just can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sounds tortured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turns and walks out of the office. I don’t follow her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis really does change things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need time to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-two\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFort Knox\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTina was on my mind all damn night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe haven’t spoken since she let me in on her blatant refusal to have children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuffle around papers on my desk while I think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m thirty five years old. I’m definitely not getting any younger and spent most of my adult life believing I’d someday have children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen hurricane Tina tore through my life and my heart. I built her up so much. I was sure she was perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, she’s not quite perfect anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut does that mean she’s any less perfect for you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s think about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no way I’m selling The White Rabbit which means all my weekends would be demanding and hectic.
