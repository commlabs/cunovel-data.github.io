Eddie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt echoed from down the hall and she sounded terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaped up from the bare mattress and looked around in the dark. He was fully dressed except for his work boots. He\u0027d rolled his jacket into a makeshift pillow. He felt around for the flashlight and the Glock he\u0027d left on a bedside table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d left a light on in the hall before calling it a night. What had happened to it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guys!\" she called again, her voice quavering. \"Can you come here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On my way,\" Jack said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found the flashlight and turned it on, then grabbed his Glock. Couldn\u0027t imagine why he\u0027d need it but he preferred to have it with him rather than on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe piles of upended chairs and bureaus and such scattered around the room cast weird shadows as he hurried toward his open door. He flipped the switch on the wall as he went by but the ceiling light didn\u0027t go on. Odd. It had worked before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight flashed in the hall, though, and it turned out to be Eddie with his own flashlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Weezy?\" Eddie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in here,\" she called from two doors down where she\u0027d chosen to spend the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack reached the darkened room first. A flick of her wall switch proved that her light didn\u0027t work either, but Jack\u0027s flash beam found her wrapped in her coat and crouched on the bed, holding her unlit flashlight and looking terrified. He entered with Eddie close behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone was here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who? How?\" Eddie said. \"There\u0027s nobody here but us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack couldn\u0027t argue with that. The windows were barred and they\u0027d barricaded both downstairs doors before hitting the mattresses. Even someone with a key couldn\u0027t get in without making a terrible racket. Eddie tried her wall switch again - as dead as Jack\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mine\u0027s dead too,\" Eddie said. \"Seems we\u0027ve lost power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack held his pistol against his thigh as he flashed his beam around. Like every other room, lots of furniture stacked and bunched together, but no people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m telling you someone was in the room.\" Her voice rose in pitch. \"He was standing over the bed and looking down at me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027He\u0027? \" Jack said. \"What\u0027d he look like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, it could have been a she, but it ... I don\u0027t know ... it felt like a he. I grabbed my flashlight but it\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hit the button and the beam shot across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It didn\u0027t work before.\" She turned it off and back on again. \"I swear it didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack said, \"The place is empty except for us. It wasn\u0027t Eddie or me, so that leaves a nightmare.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t dreaming. Believe me, I know when I\u0027m dreaming. What time is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie pulled out his cell phone and pressed a button. Jack saw his puzzled frown in the glow from its display.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No service. It worked fine before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo service meant no time on the display. Jack hadn\u0027t yet become dependent on his phone for the time. He trained his flash beam on his watch, an old Seiko that refused to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two thirty-two,\" he said, then noticed the second hand wasn\u0027t moving. \"Wait. I take that back. My watch has stopped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay. This was getting weird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy\u0027s door slammed closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack jumped just like everyone else. Eddie was closest. He grabbed the knob, twisted, and pulled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It won\u0027t budge.\" His voice had developed a quaver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack stepped over to help. \"Maybe the two of us - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack? Eddie?\" Weezy said. Her voice sounded strange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack turned and saw her awed expression as she trained her flashlight beam across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe followed her beam and stepped back in shock when he saw two chairs on the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the...?\" His mouth had gone dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose chairs had been part of the furniture pile a moment ago. Now they were in the front corner of the room, resting on their sides against the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re outta here,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and Eddie tried the heavy wooden door together but it wouldn\u0027t budge - wouldn\u0027t even rattle. Seemed like it had fused to the frame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crossed the room to the window and looked out. Beyond the wrought-iron bars, the frozen surface of Quaker Lake reflected the streetlights of the sleeping town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to raise the sash but it wouldn\u0027t budge - either painted shut or fused like the door. He could break the glass but didn\u0027t see the point: They\u0027d never get past the bars crisscrossing the opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, guys,\" Eddie said, his ear pressed against the door. \"Somebody\u0027s out in the hall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack joined him at the door. He heard movement outside to their right. Floorboards creaking, joists squealing in distress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone? No, something was moving down the hall, something massive, coming their way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stand back,\" Jack said, pulling Eddie with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sounds of the walls, floor, and maybe even the ceiling of the hallway struggling to hold together grew louder and closer. Cracks zigzagged along the stucco walls of the room, the door bulged inward as if some monstrous weight were pressing against its far side. It didn\u0027t look like it could hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack looked around, spotted an open closet door, pointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In there!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no idea if it would protect them from whatever was out there, but he saw no other options.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir flashlights - all three of them - died just before the room door slammed open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy screamed, Eddie shouted in terror. For want of anything better to do, Jack dropped to one knee and fired a half dozen quick shots at the doorway. The muzzle flashes revealed what looked like a glistening gray surface sliding past, oblivious to the bullets. Nothing appeared to be entering the room so Jack saved his rounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe ten seconds later the sounds and the sense of massive movement faded away, and their flashlights came on. All three beams zipped to the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell was that?\" Eddie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack shook his head. \"Not sure I want to know. But I do want to know what\u0027s going on here. Weezy - any ideas?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right now I\u0027m having a little trouble thinking about anything but getting out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m with you on that. The Lonely Pine Motel doesn\u0027t sound so bad now, does it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like paradise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlock held before him, Jack eased toward the gaping doorway and the darkness beyond it. Eddie came up beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, that thing is loud,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The pistol?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. My ears are ringing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo were Jack\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never fired one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shot my share of rifles, but always outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, inside a small, closed room was a different ball game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack poked his head through the doorway and flashed his beam quickly in both directions. Empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept for the slime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe walls, floor, and ceiling glistened with a mucousy substance, as if some giant slug had just passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Weezy,\" Eddie said, stepping into the hall. \"Let\u0027s get the hell - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slipped on the slime and would have gone down if Jack hadn\u0027t caught his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Steady, guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie stepped back inside, wiping his shoe on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slippery as hell. We\u0027re going to have to be careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy was reaching under her bed. \"Let me get my backpack and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door slammed shut again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, jeez,\" Jack said. \"Now what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA startling clatter from the corner of the room: The two chairs had fallen from the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack pulled on the doorknob and the door swung open with no problem. The hall seemed even darker than before. His flash beam picked up no glistening mucus this time. In fact, it picked up nothing at all. The hallway was gone, and in its place ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA darkness so absolute it swallowed his flash beam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Jack,\" Eddie said. \"What the hell is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wish I knew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did know it made his gut crawl. He couldn\u0027t say why. Maybe it was the sense of emptiness in that blackness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe backed up a step, reaching for the door to slam it closed, but the blackness didn\u0027t enter the room. It simply sat there, absorbing light. A return trip to the window showed the same tranquil scene as before. Nothing had changed out there, but what had happened in the hall? What was the darkness? What did it hide?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe returned to the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep back, Jack,\" Weezy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hardly needed to be told that. But as he approached he again sensed that empty feeling out there. He had a strange impression that the hallway wasn\u0027t simply hidden in the blackness, but was no longer there. A feeling that nothing was out there, not even light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe handed Eddie his flash and stuck the Glock into his waistband. Then he grabbed a chair from the nearby pile of furniture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack?\" Weezy said behind him. \"What - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a little experiment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tossed the chair through the doorway and then stepped back, listening ... and listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt should have hit the hallway floor. But it didn\u0027t. If by some stretch of possibility that was gone, it should have landed on the first floor. But it didn\u0027t. After that, some clatter from the basement should have echoed up. But it didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack?\" Eddie handed back the flashlight as he stepped up beside him and stared into the black. \"What happened to the chair?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a clue. It could be still falling, for all I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blackness was bottomless. Or effectively so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie was shaking his head. \"No ... no ... shit like this doesn\u0027t happen. It\u0027s some kind of trick ... an illusion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned, grabbed another chair, and heaved it through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three of them stood in silence, listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo sound. Falling is silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie backed away. \"What have we got ourselves into?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaken, Jack closed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie flicked the beam of his flashlight back and forth between Jack and Weezy. Hard to say which wobbled more: the beam or his voice. \"And how can you two be so calm about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been living with these sorts of things for years now. And I\u0027ve had more practice hiding it. And your sister\u0027s suspected this stuff since she was a kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack turned to Weezy. He didn\u0027t want to shine the light in her eyes, so he kept the beam trained on the mattress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Weez. You\u0027re the expert here. What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I-I don\u0027t know. I can make some guesses but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guess away. Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, the Compendium says that the mortar used to build the Lodges is often mixed with some dirt from a nexus point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s a nexus point?\" Eddie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Places around the globe where the barrier - sometimes called the Veil - between our world and the Otherness is very thin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s one not too far from here,\" Jack said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy stared at him. \"You know about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I used to hang with some piney kids in high school. They mentioned a \u0027bald spot\u0027 deep in the Pines where weird lights flashed at certain times and nothing ever grew - hence the name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like the nexus point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long has all this been going on?\" Eddie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy looked at him. \"Almost forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But ... it\u0027s practically in our backyard - or at least what was our backyard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"Tried to tell you, but you wouldn\u0027t listen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack remembered one of Eddie\u0027s favorite descriptors for his older sister: crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m listening now. Black is black, remember? This can\u0027t happen every night. Why\u0027s it happening now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if you combine the nexus point dirt in the mortar, and a nexus point not too far away, with the proximity of an equinox, maybe ... ow!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had been reaching into the backpack where she kept the Compendium. Now she snatched it away and shook it in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie stepped closer. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Compendium. It\u0027s hot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack reached in and gave it a quick touch. Right. Hot. Hot enough to raise a blister if you tried to hold it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The book must be reacting to all this weirdness,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack wondered about that. \"Maybe it\u0027s triggering it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezy nodded. \"That could be. Take all those elements - the mortar, the proximity to the nexus point, the time in the sun\u0027s cycle - and they may not be enough. But add this relic of the First Age to the mix and ... who knows?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever the cause,\" he said, \"we\u0027re stuck here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Eddie said, going to the window. \"We can\u0027t stay here! We\u0027ve got to get out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack said, \"Not gonna happen. But if we stick together and stay awake, we\u0027ll make it to morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie leaned closer. \"How can you be so sure this\u0027ll change by then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sunrise,\" Weezy said, nodding. \"Sunrise will change everything. You\u0027ll see.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-77.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
