{"id":16228,"no":15,"title":"Chapter 14","content":"\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; In which we are told how Honey-Bee saw her mother again, but \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;could not embrace her\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Honey-Bee, a crown on her head, was now more often sad and lost in thought than when her hair flowed loose over her shoulders, and when she went laughing to the forge and pulled the beards of her good friends Pic, Tad and Dig, whose faces, red from the reflected flames, gave her a gay welcome. But now these good dwarfs, who had once danced her on their knees and called her Honey-Bee, bowed as she passed and maintained a respectful silence. She grieved because she was no longer a child, and she suffered because she was the Princess of the Dwarfs.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was no longer a pleasure for her to see King Loc, since she had seen him weep because of her. But she loved him, for he was good and unhappy. One day, if one may say that there are days in the empire of the dwarfs, she took King Loc by the hand and drew him under the cleft in the rock, through which a sunbeam shone, along whose rays there danced a haze of golden dust.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Little King Loc,” she said, “I suffer. You are a king and you love me and I suffer.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hearing these words from the pretty damsel, King Loc replied:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I love you, Honey-Bee of Clarides, Princess of the Dwarfs; and that is why I have held you captive in our world, in order to teach you our secrets, which are greater and more wonderful than all those you could learn on earth amongst men, for men are less skilful and less learned than the dwarfs.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes,” said Honey-Bee, “but they are more like me than the dwarfs, and for that reason I love them better. Little King Loc, let me see my mother again if you do not wish me to die.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Without replying King Loc went away. Honey-Bee, desolate and alone, watched the ray of light which bathes the whole face of nature and which enfolds all the living, even to the beggars by the wayside, in its resplendent waves. Slowly this ray paled, and its golden radiance faded to a pale blue light. Night had come upon earth. A star twinkled over the cleft in the rock.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then some one gently touched her on the shoulder, and she saw King Loc wrapped in a black cloak. He had another cloak on his arm with which he covered the young girl.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Come,” said he.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he led her out of the under-world. When she saw again the trees stirred by the wind, the clouds that floated across the moon, the splendour of the night so fresh and blue, when she breathed again the fragrance of the herbage, and when the air she had breathed in childhood again entered her breast in floods, she gave a great sigh and thought to die of joy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n King Loc had taken her in his arms; small though he was, he carried her as lightly as a feather, and they glided over the ground like the shadows of two birds.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You shall see your mother again, Honey-Bee. But listen! You know that every night I send her your image. Every night she sees your dear phantom; she smiles upon it, she talks to it and she caresses it. To-night she shall, instead, see you yourself. You will see her, but you must not touch her, you must not speak to her, or the charm will be broken and she will never again see you nor your image, which she does not distinguish from you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Then I will be prudent, alas! little King Loc!... See! See!...”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Sure enough the watch-tower of Clarides rose black on the hill. Honey-Bee had hardly time to throw a kiss to the beloved old stone walls when the ramparts of the town of Clarides, overgrown with gillyflowers already flew past; already she was ascending the terrace, where the glow-worms glimmer in the grass, to the postern, which King Loc easily opened, for the dwarfs are masters of metals, nor can locks, padlocks, bolts, chains or bars ever stop them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She climbed the winding stairs that led to her mother’s room, and she paused to clasp her beating heart with both her hands. Softly the door opened, and by the light of a night lamp that hung from the ceiling she saw her mother in the holy silence that reigned, her mother frailer and paler, with hair grey at the temples, but in the eyes of her daughter more beautiful even than in past days as she remembered her riding fearlessly in magnificent attire. As usual the mother beheld her daughter as in a dream, and she opened her arms as if to caress her. And the child, laughing and sobbing, was about to throw herself into those open arms; but King Loc tore her away, and like a wisp of straw he bore her through the blue landscape to the Kingdom of the Dwarfs.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3033/83855.html","bookId":1061,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 7:35:17 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 7:35:17 AM"}
