I shoved the shirt in my coat pocket and followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked down the stairs together. It was quiet except for the echoing sound of our steps. It wasn’t usual for places like this to be so quiet. Surely someone here slept with the TV on—and surely these walls were so poorly insulated that we ought to be able to hear it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you hear that?” Anna asked, just as I’d been making sure I’d heard nothing at all. She fell to a crouch and shot down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait!” I shouted, and ran down after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA group of ten men met us in the street, their black stockbroker-style suits casting stark outlines against the snow. They didn’t need snow gear—they wouldn’t feel the cold, nor would they care if anyone saw them. They were all alike, vampires or daytimers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Help!” I shouted. “Someone—help!” I knew this wasn’t the kind of neighborhood that worked in. No one knew us, it was none of their business, and I was sure one of the vampires here would be able to bend human attention away like so many of them could. Still— “Call 911!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the men advanced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m a noncombatant! She’s under my protection!” I addressed him, putting myself in front of Anna. I didn’t have my badge on me, but—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raced around me, up the street, peeling off layers of clothing. She ran three steps at a time up a stoop and then launched herself horizontally at a suited man who clearly wasn’t ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe they were so used to thinking of her as weak that they were unprepared. Or maybe she’d gotten better faster than they could have imagined. She flew by the outlier, one hand out, and snatched half his neck from him as she passed. His head lolled to one side, clearly showing the stub of his spine before dust started pouring out of the hole she’d left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next one was even faster—guts strewn for an instant, and then many soft popping sounds, as he turned into a suit full of dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were so many of them, and she was awesomely fast—I wondered again what she was. I’d never seen a vampire in action—maybe they were all like this? As she dispatched one after another, I realized I was seeing what she was doing now. She was slowing down. Whatever superstrength homeless blood, a half-empty blood bag, and a century’s worth of rage had given her was waning. Eventually one of them fought back and tossed her on her rear into the snow. I ran forward to where she’d fallen, but she wasn’t there anymore—he’d kicked her like a soccer ball up into the streetlight on the curb. She’d dented its base and recovered, but then five of them were on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please help! Someone help!” I shouted, and I ran forward, trying to pull the last of them off. He swatted me aside. I fell on my ass in the snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could have killed me—any of them could have. But I didn’t matter to them—why should I, when without her at the tribunal, I was already dead without consequence, and for whatever purposes they wanted me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA car arrived and their tide shifted course, drawing her toward its opening door. I saw into the backseat—and a face I recognized looked out at me. Stone-gray eyes and, when he saw me, a mocking grin. The vampire who’d first held Anna captive was there for half a second before he pulled back into the darkness of the car like a trapdoor spider. The remaining suits shoved Anna in. The car drove away and those who lived dispersed, running to the ends of the earth like so many ninjas on a late-night cartoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood up, knocked the ice off my rear, and looked around. Not a single window had opened on the street, not a single blind or curtain was raised, and there were no sirens in the distance. No one had noticed our altercation at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dented street lamp looked like any other street lamp that’d met a buzzed driver. The vampire dust looked like soot in the snow. Yuri’s shirts were dark where they’d absorbed the melting snow, watermarks spreading out like blood. And I was alone, again. I shoved the last shirt, the one Anna had given me, deeper into my pocket, and walked as fast as I could back to the train station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-NINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat would I do now? Where would I go? Where had they taken her? I was sore, I was cold, and I was royally pissed off. The clouds hid the moon from me, but I didn’t need to see it to know my time was winding down. I sat on a different train with the same watch advertisement, only this time someone’d drawn a cock by her mouth. The graffiti matched my sentiment. I’d been dicked over. Worse yet, Anna’d been dicked over. God, to get free after a hundred years, only to be trapped again? How horrible was that? I shuddered inside my jacket, even as I began to sweat. I stared at the advertisement, and felt like if I looked at the watch faces closely enough, I could see the remaining time in my life tick away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA group of young men loaded on. It was technically late at night. I pretended to ignore them while paying attention out of the corner of my eye. They were busy discussing something exciting among themselves, and I tried to be charitable and think they were high-spirited instead of dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of them spotted me, and broke from their pack. He came over, and I stiffened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Miss?” I didn’t respond. My mouth was dry. “Yo, miss?” he said, waving a hand in front of my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared up at him. “What do you want?” I said, in a voice that encouraged no further interaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re bleeding,” he said, pointing at my lap. “Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down, and saw Yuri’s shirt, with blood on the cuff where Anna had wiped her eyes. And his hand shifted, to point at my coat shoulder, where there was even more blood—from when we’d hugged, I guessed. I stared at my shoulder in disbelief for a moment, before looking up at the man whom I’d erroneously judged. Someone’s mother, somewhere, had raised them right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s all right. It’s not mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyebrows rose, but he nodded and sidestepped back to his friends. I got off at the next stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI trudged the rest of the way home, with Anna’s bloodlike tears, or tearlike blood, on my shoulder and on Yuri’s cuff. What was happening to Anna now? What were they doing to her? I couldn’t leave her like that. I just couldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went inside my house and found the lawyer’s number. He’d said not to call back if I hadn’t found her—but I had, then I’d lost her again, and someone had to help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang four times. I expected voice mail soon—maybe vampires had caller ID. It was night at least, just before two A.M. I paced around inside my kitchen as it rang again. Who else could I call afterward?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello,” said the voice I remembered. It sounded like it was going to go into a voice mail message after all, the tone was so formal and low—but there was a pause. “Hello?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re awake!” I exclaimed in relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s Edie Spence. We spoke the other day, about the murder and the girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause. “Go on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I found her.” Then I stopped and thought about what next to say. How could I sum up the events of the night and not sound insane?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But?” the anonymous voice on the other end of the line asked archly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She was kidnapped.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really.” His inflection on the word rose and fell in ironic disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really. She swore she’d help me before that … but…” I stood in front of my refrigerator, staring at its ivory-colored door, as blank as my mind of good sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You tell the most interesting tales, Miss Spence.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not a story.” I leaned forward and rested my forehead on the door. The cheap metal dimpled inward, with a thunk. “She needs our help, they took her away—you don’t understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She promised you she’d be there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, then.” I heard papers shuffling in the background. “My appointment book is already full until dawn tonight. But I may have time to see you early tomorrow, before sunrise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You—you’re taking my case?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If she swore she’d be there she’ll try.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You … believe me?” I stood up straight, and my fridge door popped back into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m your lawyer. It doesn’t matter what I believe. What matters is that she wouldn’t have sworn it if she hadn’t intended to help you. Unlike humans, vampires are creatures of their word.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes. “I get off at seven-thirty tomorrow morning—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eight A.M., then.” He started spouting off an address, which I wrote quickly down. “Be on time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll help me save her, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice on the other end of the line paused. “You should worry about your own fate first, Miss Spence. Eight tomorrow,” he said, and the line went dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned back against my cheap fridge again, and again felt it buckle behind me. Worry about my own fate first—but how could I live with myself while knowing about Anna’s?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe address the lawyer’d given me was off the public transport routes, so I drove to work that night. It was unfair that I had to keep going to work with all my personal drama. But I didn’t have much time off saved, and every time I called in, I was worried I’d be fired without cause—it wasn’t like Y4 nurses had a union to protect us. With my luck, I’d be fired just as Jake was shooting up the eight ball to end all eight balls, and then what would happen to him? He’d find out he wasn’t superman and that he could still get high five seconds before his happy heart stopped cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, what would I be doing at home, anyhow? Doing my depressed-oversleeping thing? Or eating everything I had in my fridge because it was there? Worrying about resaving Anna? Pacing around, listening to Merle Haggard, like Dad always did?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled my Chevy into the empty visitor’s lot and pulled on the parking brake. No, being at work would be better than all of those. I hoped. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nightshifted-edie-spence-1/page-23.html","bookId":2618,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:52:34 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:52:34 PM"}
