How Siegfried first saw Kriemhild","content":"\u0026nbsp;Now day by day the watchers saw heroes Rhineward ride, \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Warriors fain of the joyance of that great festal-tide,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Knights that for love of the Rhine-lords into the Rhineland pressed;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And ever with gifts were they greeted, swift steed and goodly vest.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Fair-dight by this were the high-seats with purple and gleam of gold\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the noblest and the bravest, as the ancient tale hath told,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the princes two-and-thirty that thronged to the festival.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And in rivalry of beauty fair women arrayed them withal.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There Giselher the stripling all-eager might ye see,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As he welcomed the homeland-dweller and the stranger courteously;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And with him stood Gernot his brother and all their knightly train:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With the honour of ancient custom they greeted each noble thane.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Through the Rhineland highways rode they on saddles with gold red-glowing;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Great shields all splendour-blazoned, rich mantles lordly-flowing\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Went flashing up the city to that glorious festal-tide:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, men unhealed blithe-hearted looked forth on their knightly pride;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ay, the battle-stricken tossing on beds of pain all day\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Forgat how near to the shadow of bitter death they lay:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the sick and the fever-blasted love’s lips forgot to sigh,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So glad were they all for the dawning of the festal days so nigh;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For they thought, “In such royal bounty shall we live and see good days!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There were murmurs of mirth unmeasured through all the city’s ways;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There were overflowings of gladness—more bliss no man hath beheld:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n High through the land of Gunther the tides of joyance swelled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All on a merry morning of Whitsuntide rode they,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Those splendour-vestured chosen brave knights in long array,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 37}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Five thousand men—nay, haply yet more, to the King’s feast bound:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To and fro were flashing the light jests, and the laughter echoed round.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now on this was the King still musing—thereof had he long been ware—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How the heart of the Netherland hero lay tangled in love’s snare\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Spell-drawn unto his sister, whom yet he had ne’er looked on,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The lady by whom all maidens were in loveliness outshone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (C) And he spake: “Now all give counsel, both kinsman and vassal true,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n What thing to make all-perfect this feast-tide shall we do,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That no man may chide us for failing in aught in the coming days;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For in sooth by our deeds men judge us at the last, to blame us or praise.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then the Lord of Metz, knight Ortwein, spake to that kingly host:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If thy festival with honour shall be crowned to the uttermost,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Thou suffer thy guests to look on the maidens peerless-fair\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Whose praise through the land Burgundian is rumoured everywhere.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wherein is a man’s heart-pleasure, and his eyes’ most dear delight,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Save in loveliness of a maiden, in the beauty of lady bright?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Thou suffer then that thy sister before thy guests appear.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Leapt the heart of many a hero that welcome word to hear.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Full fain will I heed thy counsel,” was Gunther’s answering word,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And thereat were the hearts of all men exultation-stirred;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he spake to the Lady Uta, and to Kriemhild the lovely-eyed,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To come with all their maidens to the King’s high festal-tide.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then in the cedar-caskets for fair attire sought they,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And unfolded the flashing splendour of royal-rich array,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the cloudy lace and the bracelets, whereof good store they had.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So with loveliest adorning were the winsome maidens clad.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was many a young knight yearning that day in eager wise\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That he might be found well-pleasing in the high-born ladies’ eyes.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That hope would he not have bartered, no, not for a kingdom’s fee.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The fair forms unbeholden ere this it was joy to see.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 38}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then the great King gave commandment that a guard of honour should go\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With his sister and his mother, in their farings to and fro,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of a hundred of his good knights, each man with sword in hand,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As was ever the royal custom in fair Burgundia-land.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Beside her princess-daughter Uta the queenly came,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And a bright train followed after of many a lovely dame,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Five score, yea more peradventure, in costly raiment arrayed;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And paced behind fair Kriemhild many a winsome maid.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From a stately tiring-bower those daintiest feet forth paced:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then surged the great press forward of heroes eager-faced\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Which had stood there long-expectant, if haply their lot might be\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To look glad-eyed on the Fairest, on the Star of Burgundy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now forth of the doors the Loveliest came, as the morning-red\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From lowering clouds forth breaketh;—lo, how his heart-ache fled,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n His, who in his soul had shrined her through all that weary tide!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For he saw that glory of women stand there in her beauty’s pride.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Flashed many a priceless gemstone from the folds of her attire,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the roses flushed through the lilies, a snare of hearts’ desire.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Howsoe’er ’gainst the spell of her beauty one strove, he needs must own\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That nothing so passing lovely in the wide world yet had he known.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As the full moon in her glory swims on before the stars,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the brightness of her splendour floats forth of the cloudy bars,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So before all other women shone out that Queen of Love.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Well might the hearts of the heroes be uplifted for joy thereof!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Paced onward before the maidens the stately chamberlains.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now could they forbear no longer, those noble-hearted thanes,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But to gaze on her winsome sweetness forward still did they press.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then was Siegfried’s heart joy-ravished, and anon in heaviness.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In his inmost soul was he musing: “How dared I dream such bliss\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That I, I ever should woo thee?—an idle dream was this!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet must I for aye be a stranger? Better that I lay dead!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And oft in his thoughts’ wild tumult he paled, and anon flushed red.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 39}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There Siegelind’s son stood moveless, and so winsome did he seem\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As though by the hand of a master were the angel of his dream\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Limned on the missal-parchment: none looked on him, and forbore\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To own that so comely a hero had none seen theretofore.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then the knights that attended Kriemhild bade all to left and to right\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Avoid from the path, and obedient to the word was many a knight.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n What joy it was to behold them, that heart-uplifted throng,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As the gentle-nurtured ladies all queenlike swept along!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then spake the Prince Burgundian, and Gernot uttered his rede:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The hero who did thee service ungrudging in thy need,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Gunther, belovèd brother, thou guerdon him for the same\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Before all these: of my counsel shall no man dare think shame.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Bid Siegfried unto my sister, that he meet her face to face,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That the maiden may greet him: of the honour shall we win us enduring grace.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If to him be accorded her greeting, who on knight smiled never before,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n We have gotten this goodly war-thane to our friend for evermore.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hasted the kinsmen of Gunther unto where did Siegfried stand,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And they bare that courteous bidding to the knight of Netherland:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “This is the King’s good pleasure, that thou come where the seed-royal be,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To the end that his sister may greet thee for especial honour to thee.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How thrilled the soul of Siegfried to hear that gracious word!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Passed as a dream his heart-ache, his spirit with rapture was stirred\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That on Uta’s lovely daughter he should look with unhindered eyes:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And she, she received Prince Siegfried in courtly-winsome wise.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When she saw him stand before her, that hero-hearted lord,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Her cheeks were aflame with the love-light, her sweet lips spake the word:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Welcome to thee, Lord Siegfried, to a good and noble knight!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then the wings of his soul at her greeting soared to the heaven’s height\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Love-lowly he bent before her: she laid her hand in his;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And each moved on by other in a yearning trance of bliss.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From their eyes the soft love-lightning flashed those twain alway\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Strong hero and fair maiden—yet stolen glances were they.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 40}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ask ye, were those white fingers by him pressed lovingly\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For speech of the heart?—such knowledge is all too high for me;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet—yet I may nowise believe it, that he spared to do this thing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Soon came sweet self-betrayal of the heart that had found its king.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was all in the summer season, in the very glory of May.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Never his heart had tasted such bliss as on that glad day,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Never such soul-uplifting, as in that hour he knew\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When walked that maiden beside him, whom the hero fain would woo.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then many a knight was thinking: “Ah me, that my bliss it were\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even so to be pacing beside her, as he is pacing there!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And O in mine arms to clasp her!—how fain thereof had I been!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet who might begrudge?—never hero was so worthy to win a queen.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From what far land soever those guests had come, each thane\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Had eyes, in all that feast-tide, for nothing save these twain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then suffered was the maiden to kiss that goodly knight:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Never in all his life-days had he known such dear delight.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But the King of the Danefolk murmured under his breath straightway:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ah, many for this high greeting lie sorely hurt this day\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By the hand of Siegfried stricken—for witness stand I here:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n God grant his face in Daneland may never more appear!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then the heralds cried that all folk should avoid to left and right\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From the path of Kriemhild the lovely; and many a gallant knight\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And warrior gently-nurtured in her train to the minster hied:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So for a space was parted the hero from her side.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So passed she into the minster with her maiden-company;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the dim aisles shone with beauty so glorious to see,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That many a prayer dropped earthward that should to heaven aspire,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For of all those chosen champions was she the eyes’ desire.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now scarce could Siegfried tarry till the mass was brought to an end,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And his heart still sang thanksgiving unto Fortune, unto the friend\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Which had bowed unto him her favour whom shrined in his heart he bare:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Fast bound in loyal service was he to the Fairest Fair.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 41}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When again forth out of the minster after the mass she came,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Again to her presence was bidden that hero of far-sung fame.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then the winsome-lovely maiden her thanks unto him outpoured\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That so bravely beyond all others he helped when her brethren warred:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Lord Siegfried, now God reward thee,” that Queen of Beauty said:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The good knights’ loyal homage this day hast thou merited;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All true hearts’ love-avowal right nobly hast thou earned!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then the love in the eyes of Siegfried on the eyes of Kriemhild burned.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “For ever and aye will I serve thee!” Siegfried the hero said:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Never to rest or slumber will I lay down mine head\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Till thine every wish be accomplished, while life shall endure in me!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And this do I, O Kriemhild, Kriemhild, for love of thee!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So it fell that through twelve days, ever as dawned each new day’s light,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By the witchery-winsome maiden lingereth still the knight\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Oft as in kingfolk’s presence her feet through the fair halls pace,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For mighty love hath constrained her to yield unto him this grace.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Glad noise of jubilation and the merry tourney’s clang,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Still as the days on-fleeted, round Gunther’s palace rang,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Within, without, as in feast-hall and in lists the valiant vied;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And by marvels of prowess were Ortwein and Hagen magnified.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In what manly sport soever men strove, these twain evermore,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n These champions keen in the onset, their part to the uttermost bore.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the eyes of the guests of the kingdom bright made they their renown:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of the whole land of King Gunther the glory were they and the crown.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They which had long lain wounded now to the sun forth came:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They were fain with Gunther’s liegemen to share each knightly game,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Would wield the fence of the buckler and hurl the lance afar:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n No lack had they of companions in the merry mimic war.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And ever in the feast-hall that kingly host took heed\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That his guests should be served of the choicest, that no least word should proceed\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of blame from the lips of any, such as smircheth the name of a king;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And aye mid his guests was he passing with gracious welcoming.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 42}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he spake in the midst: “Ye good knights, or ever ye ride from my land,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Accept ye the gifts of my giving, for so doth mine heart’s wish stand,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And to you will I aye be beholden: then think not scorn thereof,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For with that which I share among you is given mine heart’s whole love.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then answered the lords of Daneland there as they stood in hall:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Or ever aback to the homeland we ride delivered from thrall,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Assure to us peace abiding: thereof is our need full sore,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Seeing many our friends down-stricken by your friends shall rise no more.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now by this from his hurts recovered was Lüdegast the Dane,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the Lord of the land of the Saxons was whole from the battle again,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Albeit some of their warriors must they leave in a strange land dead.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then went King Gunther to Siegfried, and drew him apart, and he said:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now give me herein thy counsel”—thus spake he unto the knight—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Our captive guests would ride hence with the first of the morrow’s light,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And petition for reconciling long-lasting with mine and me.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n O valiant knight, give counsel how best it seemeth to thee.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now what these two kings proffer, unto thee shall it now be told:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Five hundred horses’ burden they tender of red gold.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This willingly give they for ransom, so I will set them free.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Spake Siegfried the strong: “For thine honour this thing shall nowise be.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nay, freely, without all ransom, let them fare forth hence, these twain,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If so be that these noble war-lords will swear henceforth to refrain\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From riding the raid of the foeman hitherward unto your land:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And for pledge hereunto be given a king’s unsullied hand.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I will do even after thy counsel,” he said. So parted they:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And unto their adversaries was answer made straightway\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That the gold was desired of no man that was proffered of them at the first.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ah, sick were their hearts with longing for dear ones, and home-athirst!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Shields many treasure-laden his henchmen thitherward bare,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And therefrom to his friends bright silver unweighed did the knight-king share,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Five hundred marks unto each one—unto many an one yet more:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So was Gunther advised of Gernot, that noble counsellor.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 43}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then prayed all, “Let us depart hence”; for now would they fain ride home;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And into the presence of Kriemhild did the guests for farewell come,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And unto the foot of the high-seat whereon sat Uta the Queen.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ne’er in such gracious fashion were guests sped forth, I ween.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now void were the city’s hostels, as forth of the gates they rode;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet still in the land Burgundian in royal state abode\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The King with all his kinsfolk in the midst of a knightly train,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And each day in the presence of Kriemhild appeared each noble thane.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then Siegfried the hero petitioned, “I pray you, let me depart”;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For his hope waxed faint of winning her who was queen of his heart:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the King heard tell of his purpose, that thence he would fare straightway.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But the young lad Giselher pleaded, and wrought on him to delay:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Whither away, O Siegfried, is thine heart on journeying set?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nay, hearken to my petition, abide with the good knights yet;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Abide thou with King Gunther and his loyal liegemen still.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lo, here be lovely ladies: thou mayst see them at thy will.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Made answer Siegfried the mighty: “Nay then, let the steeds abide.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lo, I have foregone my purpose, and hence not yet will I ride.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Bear hence the shields and uphang them—albeit I long for mine home,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lord Giselher’s love true-hearted hath turned my mind therefrom.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So tarried the valiant warrior there by a friend’s love won.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In all the rest of the wide world other place was there none\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wherein he had rested so gladly; and now none said him nay,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But he looked on the beauty of Kriemhild ever day by day;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For the sake of her measureless fairness he could not choose but stay.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In many a pleasant pastime they wore the hours away.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Only he felt love’s torment, he knew none other care.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n —Ah me, but the days were coming when she should be his death-snare!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3304/90332.html","bookId":422,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 10:37:12 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 10:37:12 AM"}
