{"id":21353,"no":102,"title":"Chapter 9","content":"Early the next year Reuben heard that Caro and her lover had left Camber, and gone no one knew where, but by that time the elapse of months had dulled his feelings on the matter, and Caro, never very important in herself, was buried under the concerns of his farm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Odiam, after superhuman efforts, was looking up again. Years of steady work and strenuous economy had restored it to something like its former greatness. Reuben was no longer hampered by an extravagant wife, and he also had the advantage of a clear field. For at last Grandturzel had given up the battle. Realf and Tilly were now the parents of four healthy, growing, hungry children, and had come to the conclusion that domestic happiness was better than agricultural triumph. They were contented with their position on a farm of considerable importance and fair prosperity. They took no risks, but lived happily with each other and their children, satisfied that they could comfortably rear and educate their little family, and leave it an inheritance which, if not dazzling, was not to be despised.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This was an infinite relief to Reuben. He was now no longer under the continual necessity of going one better than somebody else—he could rebuild along his own lines, and economise in the way he chose. However, this very convenient behaviour of Grandturzel did nothing to soften his resentment. Tilly and Realf were, and were always to be, unforgiven. Sometimes he could see that they seemed inclined to be friendly—Realf would touch his hat to him if they met, and[Pg 358] perhaps Tilly would smile—but Reuben was not to be won by such treacly tactics. It was largely owing to the rivalry of Grandturzel that ruin had nearly swallowed him up four years ago—and he would never be weak enough to forget it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Meantime it was soothing to contemplate the result of his efforts. After all, his own striving had done more for him than any slackness or grass-fed contentment on the part of Grandturzel. His greatest achievement was the paying off of his mortgage, which he managed in the spring of \u002779. Now he could once more begin saving money to buy another piece of Boarzell. There was something both novel and exhilarating about this return to old ways. It was over ten years since he had bought any land, but now were renewed all the ticklish delights of calculation, all the plannings and layings-out, all the contrivances and scrapings and wrestlings.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There were still about two hundred acres to acquire, including the Grandturzel inclosure, on which, however, he looked more hopefully than of old. He had so far subdued not more than about a hundred and forty acres—most of the northern slope of Boarzell adjoining Odiam and Totease, and also a small tract on the Flightshot side. This was not very encouraging, for it represented the labours of two-thirds of a lifetime, and at the same time left him with more than half his task still unaccomplished. If it had not been for his setback ten years ago he would now probably have over two hundred and fifty acres to his credit. But he told himself that he would progress more quickly now. Also, though he had not enlarged his boundaries during the last ten years, he had considerably improved the quality of the land within them. The first acquired parts of Boarzell were nearly as fruitful and richly cultivated as the original lands of the farm, and even the \u002768 ground was showing signs of coming into subjection.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\n\u003cbr\u003e Besides, Reuben had now a respectable herd of cattle—not quite so numerous or valuable as the earlier lot which had been sacrificed, but none the less respectable, and bringing him in good returns. He had made some sound profit out of his service-bull, and his sheep were paying better than they had paid for years. He no longer \"kept\" other people\u0027s cattle. Odiam, whether in stock or cash, was now inviolate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Soon the rumour spread round Peasmarsh that Backfield was going to buy some more land. Reuben himself had started it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He\u0027s done better nor he desarved,\" said Coalbran of Doozes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He\u0027s warked fur it all the same, surelye,\" said Cooper of Kitchenhour.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He\u0027s worked like the Old Un fur the last five year,\" said Dunn, the new man at Socknersh.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, let\u0027s hope as he\u0027s found it worth while now as he\u0027s lost two wives and eight children,\" was the sage comment of old Vennal of Burntbarns.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then the conversation wandered from Reuben\u0027s successes to the price he had paid for them, which proved more interesting and more comforting to those assembled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At Flightshot the Squire viewed Odiam\u0027s recovery with some uneasiness. It would be a good thing for him if he could sell more land to old Backfield, but at the same time his conscience was restless about it. Backfield was a rapacious old hound, who forced the last ounce of work out of his labourers, and the last ounce of money out of his tenants. He was a hard master and a hard landlord, and ought not to be encouraged. All the same, Bardon did not see how he was to avoid encouraging him. If Backfield applied for the land it would be suicidal folly to refuse to sell it. He was in desperate straits for money. He had appealed to Anne, who had money of her own, but Anne\u0027s reply had been frigid. She wrote:—\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\n\u003cbr\u003e \"I do not see my way to helping Flightshot while I have so many other calls upon me. Richard is still unsettled, and unable entirely to support himself. I should be a poor friend indeed if after having induced my protégé to abandon his home and rely on me, I should forsake him before he was properly established. Be a man, Ralph, and refuse to sell any more land to that greedy, selfish, unscrupulous old Backfield.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Ralph only sighed—it was all very well for Anne to talk!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59474.html","bookId":524,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 1:00:29 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 1:00:29 PM"}
