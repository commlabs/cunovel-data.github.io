Where do you think you are!?” At this time, a dragon-bearded man stepped forwards, holding a nine foot long staff in his hand. This dragon-bearded man came from a second-grade sect, and his talent was also decent. His cultivation was a half-step into the Xiantian realm. But because of his limited resources, had had been trapped at this stage for ten years and hadn’t been able to reach the Xiantian realm.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis time he came to request help from Ouyang Boyan.

Since this youth came here on a phoenix, his strength possibly surpassed even his own. With a wave of his hand, three people that were standing behind him jumped forwards; their cultivations were at the peak Houtian realm.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThey were all from the same sect.

They had an implicit faith and understanding in each others’ strength. If they attacked at the same time, rushing Lin Ming’s weak angles from four different directions, then it should be impossible for Lin Ming to block from so many attacks at once.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Out of my way!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBang!!!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA terrifying air wave of pressure erupted. Lin Ming didn’t even bother to move – it was simply the massive momentum that was contained within him suddenly breaking out at once. A savage and violent true essence recklessly shot out, and an incomparably sharp and deadly storm lifted the marble tiles off the floor.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePuff!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAll four of them spat out blood as they flew backwards, their bodies smashing into the floor and rolling back dozens of feet like gourds that had been kicked.

He stood there, not moving at all. He only shouted ‘out of my way’, and all those people were sent flying backwards by his aura!” A Houtian realm Seven Profound Valleys disciple said. His strength was better so he was able to see what had happened much more clearly than these second-grade sect disciple.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Ming?” The second-grade sect disciples were startled, “What?

At this time, no one cared to ask why Lin Ming hadn’t died. Instead, they were only baffled by his overwhelming strength.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming was only 17 years old!!!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e17 years old. Not only was his cultivation at the late Houtian realm, but his strength had reached such an abnormal degree that he was able to send four peak Houtian masters and even a half-step Xiantian master flying back, wounded! Now, the competition that these so-called talents had before was simply like little babies slapping each other – nothing but an unsightly event!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe second-grade sect martial artists felt like they were living a dream. This was a true top talent? A person like this really existed in this world?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Fierce Flood Sect’s Liu Xuan watched Lin Ming at the center of the square, his palms oozing sweat. He had grown up under the halo of a genius even since he was a baby, and his character had become naturally arrogant and proud. He believed that after stumbling into the cave mansion of a long-dead mysterious master of the South Horizon Region and obtaining a great lucky chance, that he himself would be able to enter the ranks of the top talents. But now, compared to Lin Ming, he was nothing but a joke.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe couldn’t help but glance over at Ouyang Ming, and saw that his expression was also very perturbed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAlthough Ouyang Ming hadn’t thought that these four people would be able to threaten Lin Ming’s life, there had still been four of them, and they were also skilled in combination attack techniques. At least they should have forced Lin Ming to expend some effort to deal with them. He never imagined that Lin Ming would only give a single shout, and those four would be sent flying backwards!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s talent was even more terrifying than it was a year and a half ago!

His voice contained a thick murderous intent as he said, “This is the last and final time I will show mercy. If anyone blocks my path again, then they have walked onto the path of death!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAll of the Seven Profound Valleys Elders’ complexions completely changed. Most of the Elders present were at the early Xiantian realm, and there were even several that had just entered the early Xiantian realm a few years ago. A moment ago, they were able to see everything that had happened clearly. Although that dragon-bearded man and his companions were from a small sect and also had ordinary strength, their cultivations were still at least at the peak Houtian realm. If they were in Lin Ming’s position, they wouldn’t have been able to win like Lin Ming!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFacing the current Lin Ming, this caused them to give birth to the belief that they could not block his way!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming gripped the Purple Comet Spear, walking forwards a step at a time. On the spearpoint, the power of thunder and fire flashed out!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOuyang Boyan’s complexion sank until it was able to leak water!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe finally realized the most important and dreadful truth. That was that Lin Ming had the ability to deal with him!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith every step that Lin Ming took forwards, his momentum became increasingly formidable!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOuyang Boyan felt a heavy pressure weigh down on him. The current Lin Ming was like a Death God, and he was listening to the sounds of the netherworld slowly approach!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You are dissolute!

A white-robed old man flashed and instantly appeared on the square. He was the Acacia Faction Elder Ouyang Guang, and his cultivation was at the peak of the middle Xiantian realm!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis banquet was also a celebration of him taking a concubine. As one of the hosts of this banquet, how could he allow someone to ruin it like this?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming calmly looked at Ouyang Guang. His voice was bone-chilling as he said, “You want to block my way?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What a joke. This is my Acacia Faction, it is not a place where you can be so rampant. You really think you are invincible within this world? How about you kill this old man first.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming held the Purple Comet Spear horizontally in front of him, and indifferently said, “Those who block my path will die!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming already didn’t have the tiniest bit of a favorable impression towards the Acacia Faction. Not to mention the actions of the Acacia Faction in the past, just this matter of Ouyang Boyan trying to deal with Qin Xingxuan, how could he have done so and suppressed Qin Ziya if not for the help of his connections through the Acacia Faction?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Acacia Faction was a scourge upon the Seven Profound territory. All that the Acacia Faction produced were the lowest of scum. Lin Ming was not a bloodthirsty or vicious person, but in dealing with the scum from the Acacia Faction, he had no qualms about killing them at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Truly an arrogant junior; you have no idea what it means to die! With your mere late Houtian realm cultivation you can roll over martial artists at your level, so you think no one in this world can defeat you. Today, this old man will let you experience what a Xiantian master’s strength is like!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOuyang Guang gave a loud shout, and true essence erupted from his body. Purple hued true essence gushed out from his dantian. A Xiantian realm martial artist’s dantian contained a cyclone of true essence; their true essence was much purer and thicker than a Houtian realm martial artist’s.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA dazzling purple flame instantly condensed into a purple bone lance in Ouyang Guang’s hand. From the body of this lance, ghostly cries were emitted.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was the Purple Flame Bone Lance of the ‘Divine Acacia Power’. Lin Ming had already seen this move many times. But compared to what he had seen before, the purple bone lance in Ouyang Guang’s hand was much thicker and larger. Not just that, but the end was also shaped like a grim and ominous skull – it seemed incomparably fierce.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Junior, prepare to die!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOuyang Guang threw out the bone lance in his hands. His target was Lin Ming’s stomach. Although he didn’t dare to kill Lin Ming, he absolutely wouldn’t let him leave unscathed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe ghostly skull lance was fast like lightning. A blurry shadow followed behind it, along with a long tail of purple flames. It cut through the air with the keening wail of ghosts, almost piercing through one’s eardrums.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s expression was the same, and his eyes were cold. Azure true essence billowed around his body like flames, and one could clearly hear the sound of this incomparably sharp true essence splitting the air.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Divine Demon Thunder Soul!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming thrust out his spear. Thunder howled. A thick arc of purple lightning mixed with a bright blood red bolt of lightning, twining together and forming a giant, revolving beam of lighting. This beam of lightning collided against the Purple Flame Bone Lance!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAgainst ghosts and devils, the power of thunder was absolute suppression!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter the Divine Demon Thunder Soul crashed into the Purple Flame Bone Lance, there was only a high pitched ‘\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003echi chi chi\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e’ sound.

But, the attack in his hands didn’t slow at all. After the Divine Demon Thunder Soul was sent out, Lin Ming’s spear potential turned, the Fallen Star Flame erupted!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“10,000 Flames Burning World!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFirst thunder, now flames.

He gave a loud shout, and the air around him distorted. The tiles underneath his feet were seared red by heat. He thrust his hands out like he was forming claws. A blood red light seemed to envelop his entire body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Blood Demon Claws!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith a flash of blood colored light, a crimson blood claw shot out.

The ‘Divine Acacia Power’ was originally martial arts from the demonic path. In the past, Zhang Guanyu’s Life Severing Dead Bone Blade, Ouyang Dihua’s Soul Severing Blood Skull, Ouyang Zifeng’s Purple Flame Bone Lance, and even the current Ouyang Guang’s Blood Demon Claws – all of them were the same school of martial arts.
