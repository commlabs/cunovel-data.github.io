He tilted her chin up and kissed her soundly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he started down the steps, Christina hurried after him. \"I still don\u0027t understand why I can\u0027t go with you. I would like to see your sister, and your mama, too, Lyon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next time, sweetheart. Diana will be going to Martin\u0027s party tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will Aunt Harriett also be going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably,\" Lyon answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could go with them,\" Christina suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you liked it here in the country,\" Lyon returned. \"You do, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, very much. But I\u0027m your wife, Lyon. I should do my duty with your relatives. Do you know, it\u0027s rather odd of me to admit, but I did enjoy some of the parties. There were some very nice people I would like to see again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was so firm, Christina was immediately perplexed. \"Why don\u0027t you want me to go with you? Have I done something to displease you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon reacted to the worry in her voice. He paused to look down at her, then gave in to his sudden urge to kiss her again. \"Nothing you could ever do would displease me. If you want to attend some of the parties, you\u0027ll wait until I can go with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I play cards with you and the mischief makers?\" she asked. \"I\u0027ve never played before, but I\u0027m certain it wouldn\u0027t be too difficult to master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon hid his amusement. His wife was obviously serious in her request. The sincerity in her voice said as much. \"I\u0027ll teach you another time, Christina. If you wish, I\u0027ll wait while you write a note to Diana and Aunt Harriett.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina could tell by his manner that he wasn\u0027t going to give in to her plea to go along. \"I\u0027ve already written to everyone, even Elbert and my Aunt Patricia,\" she informed him. \"Brown sent a messenger with my letters yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked on, hand in hand. When they reached his mount, he turned. \"I have to leave now, my sweet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t meant to sound so pitiful. The fact that Lyon was leaving was distressing, yes, but not nearly as much as his casual, dismissive attitude. She didn\u0027t think he was going to mind the separation at all. She, on the other hand, minded very much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t like her to be so clinging. She couldn\u0027t seem to let go of his hand. What in heaven\u0027s name was the matter with her? Lord, she felt like crying. He was only going to be away for one night, she told herself, not an eternity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon kissed her on her forehead. \"Do you have anything you wish to say to me before I leave, Christina?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice coaxed a response. Christina dropped his hand. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon let out a long sigh. He took hold of her hand again and dragged her off to the side of the path so that the stablemaster wouldn\u0027t overhear him. \"I\u0027ll miss you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice wasn\u0027t coaxing now, but brisk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it, wife, I want the soft words,\" he muttered. He immediately felt like a fool for making such a ridiculous confession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it, Lyon, I want to go to London with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christina, you\u0027re staying here,\" Lyon bellowed. He drew a deep breath, then added in a furious whisper, \"I love you, Christina. Now tell me you love me. I\u0027ve waited all week to hear you admit it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him a disgruntled look. Lyon wasn\u0027t waylaid. \"I\u0027m waiting, Christina.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have a safe journey, Lyon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon hadn\u0027t realized how important it was for him to hear her tell him she loved him until his demand was so thoroughly ignored. He stood there feeling angry and defeated, his gaze brooding as he watched Christina walk away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell,\" he muttered to himself. He mounted his steed, accepted the reins from Wendell, yet seemed incapable of nudging his stallion into moving. He couldn\u0027t even tear his gaze off the stubborn woman strolling to the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina couldn\u0027t dismiss him this time. Her hand shook when she took hold of the brass door handle. He was so horribly stubborn. He constantly prodded and nagged. He wouldn\u0027t let her shield her feelings from him. But he didn\u0027t understand the significance of what he was asking of her. Once she\u0027d given him the words, there could be no going back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, she\u0027d never be able to go home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA half smile changed her expression. The truth was both painful and joyful. She\u0027d never really been given a choice in the matter, had she? From the moment she\u0027d met Lyon, her heart had known the truth. Why had it taken her mind so long to accept?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina looked over her shoulder. Tears clouded her vision. \"Hurry home, Lyon. I will be waiting for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say the words, Christina.\" He\u0027d shouted this time, and the look on his face showed his anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral heartbeats passed before he acknowledged her admission. And then he gave her a curt nod. Oh, he was arrogant But his expression was tender, caring, so very loving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was quite enough. Christina hid her smile. A feeling of contentment and joy filled her. She suddenly felt as light as the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth had set her free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina opened the door and started to walk inside when her husband\u0027s bellow stopped her. \"Wife?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, husband?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me you trust me as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned around again. Her hands settled on her hips. She hoped he could see her exasperation. \"Don\u0027t push me, Lyon. Savor one victory at a time, like any noble warrior would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon shouted with laughter. \"Yes, Christina, one victory at a time. I\u0027ve got you now, haven\u0027t I?\" he asked, his voice and his eyes filled with merriment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man was gloating again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina strolled over to the top step. \"Yes, Lyon, you\u0027ve got me. And when you come home from London, you\u0027re going to find out just exactly what you\u0027ve gotten. No more pretenses, husband. No more lies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t be happier,\" Lyon remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enjoy the feeling, Lyon. I fear it will not last long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d called the warning over her shoulder. The front door slammed shut before Lyon could question her further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon felt as though a weight had been lifted from his shouldersâ€”and from his heart. She loved him. \"The rest will come, wife,\" he whispered to himself. \"I\u0027ll see to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d never felt so confident, so very, very peaceful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe feeling wasn\u0027t going to last long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Thirteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou were only three months old when I bundled you up and set out on another adventure. I left in the dead of night so that Patricia wouldn\u0027t be able to stop me. I didn\u0027t leave a note for her, for 1 believed she\u0027d send men after me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou were such a precious infant. Upon reflection, I think the journey was far more difficult for me than for you. You\u0027d just begun to smile, and you were such a sweet-tempered little one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had made arrangements to travel with Jacob and Emily Jackson. I\u0027d met them through Sunday church, you see, and took to them at once. They were a newly wedded couple who had sold their wedding gifts so that they\u0027d have enough coins to go in search of a new life. They were very appreciative of my contributions. Emily took to you, too, Christina. She\u0027d sing to you and rock you to sleep while I saw to the night meals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob was a man bitten by wanderlust. Every evening he\u0027d tell us the most wonderful stories about the courageous people living in the Black Hills. His brother had already taken his family there and had sent Jacob word that he was prospering as a gentleman farmer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob\u0027s fever was contagious. I soon became as excited as he was. Emily told me there were many unattached men working the raw land, that I would surely find a good man to marry. I led them to believe my husband had recently died, I admit to you, and I felt great shame for lying to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told myself over and over that the lie didn\u0027t count. Edward would never find me in this vast wilderness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe joined another wagon train when we reached what I believed was the end of the earth. I fought my exhaustion. Emily was always so cheerful. And then, on a bleak, rainy afternoon, we finally reached the valley below the most magnificent mountains I\u0027d ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember that it was a bitterly cold day. It didn\u0027t matter, though. We were free, Christina. Free. No one could hurt us now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJournal entry October 11, 1795\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon had been gone for over an hour when two letters arrived. Both were addressed to Christina, and both required her immediate attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter instructing Kathleen to take the messenger into the kitchens for refreshments, Christina took her letters into Lyon\u0027s study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first missive came from her Aunt Patricia. It was a hateful note, filled with defaming remarks about Lyon. The Countess told Christina she\u0027d learned the truth about the Marquess and felt it was her duty to warn her niece that she was married to a murderer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Countess then demanded that Christina return to London immediately so that she could accompany her aunt to the various functions of the ton. She whined about the disgraceful fact that she hadn\u0027t received a single invitation since Christina\u0027s outrageous marriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina shook her head. It had been less than a month since the wedding, but her aunt was carrying on as though a full year had passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Countess ended her list of complaints with the statement that she was sending along a letter she\u0027d received from the missionary Deavenrue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hoped Christina didn\u0027t find ill news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina was immediately suspicious. It wasn\u0027t like her aunt to offer such a good-hearted remark. She thought the Countess might be up to her usual tricks. She was familiar with her former teacher\u0027s handwriting, however, and the flourishing style of his script on the envelope indicated that he had in fact written the letter. The seal on the back of the envelope hadn\u0027t been tampered with, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConvinced that the letter was really from her dear friend, Christina finally opened it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrown was the first to react to the heart-wrenching scream coming from the library. He rushed into the room and nearly lost his composure altogether when he saw his mistress had collapsed on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shouted orders over his shoulder as he knelt down beside the Marchioness. Kathleen, Christina\u0027s maid, came running next. When she saw her mistress, she gave a yell. \"Did she swoon? What made her cry out, Brown? Is she hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cease your questions, woman,\" Brown snapped. He carefully lifted his mistress into his arms, then noticed that she clutched a letter in her hands. He decided that whatever news she\u0027d just received had caused her to faint. \"Go and prepare your lady\u0027s bed, Kathleen,\" he whispered. \"She doesn\u0027t weigh more than a feather. God help us all if she\u0027s ill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the staff had assembled, and they trailed silently behind Brown as he carried Christina up the winding staircase. Kathleen had hurried on ahead to turn down the bed, but Brown walked right past Christina\u0027s bedroom and continued on into his master\u0027s quarters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll find comfort here when she wakes up,\" he whispered to the cook. \"They are a very close couple. She sleeps in here every night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do we send for the Marquess?\" Kathleen asked between sobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get Sophie,\" Brown ordered. \"She\u0027ll know what to do about the swoon. Is the messenger still here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Kathleen nodded, Brown said, \"I shall send a message to the Marquess with him. Lewis,\" he commanded the gardener, \"go and delay him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina opened her eyes just as Brown was awkwardly pulling the covers over her. \"Do not make a fuss over me, Brown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you in pain, milady?\" Brown asked, his voice ragged with worry. \"I\u0027ve sent for Sophie. She\u0027ll know what to do,\" he added, trying to force the tremor out of his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina struggled to sit up just as a large gray-headed woman came rushing into the room. She grabbed two pillows and tucked them behind Christina\u0027s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think it is, Sophie?\" Kathleen asked. \"She let out a horrible scream and then fainted dead away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard her,\" Sophie announced. She slapped the back of her hand against Christina\u0027s forehead. Her manner was brisk, her frown intense. \"Best send for Winters, Brown. She feels fevered to me. Winters is your husband\u0027s physician,\" Sophie explained to Christina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not ill,\" Christina protested. She was surprised her voice sounded so weak to her. \"Brown, do not send for a physician. I\u0027m quite all right now. But I must go to London immediately. Please bring the carriage around front for me. Kathleen, would you see to packing a few of my gowns for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Milady, you cannot leave this bed. You are ill whether you know it or not,\" Sophie exclaimed. \"You\u0027re as pale as a cloud. Yes, you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must go to my husband,\" Christina argued. \"He will know what to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was the letter that caused your swoon, wasn\u0027t it?\" Kathleen asked, wringing her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrown turned to glare at the maid. Kathleen was immediately contrite. \"I\u0027m sorry for prying, milady, but we are all so concerned. You gave us all a scare, and we\u0027ve come to care about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristina tried to smile. \"And I care about all of you,\" she said. \"Yes, Kathleen, it was the letter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was it bad news?\" Kathleen asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course it was bad news, you silly chit,\" Brown muttered. \"Anyone with half a mind can see that it was,\" he added. \"Milady, is there anything I can do to ease your distress?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Brown,\" Christina answered. \"Don\u0027t fight me when I tell you I must leave for London at once. Please help me, Brown. I beg of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would do anything for you,\" Brown blurted out in a fervent voice. He blushed and added, \"The Marquess will be upset by this change in orders, but if you are truly set on going, I shall send four strong men to accompany you. Kathleen, hurry and do your lady\u0027s bidding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will I be going with you?\" Kathleen asked her mistress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will,\" Brown announced before Christina could dissuade her eager maid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would like a few minutes alone,\" Christina whispered. \"I must grieve in privacy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey understood then. Someone close to their mistress had passed away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrown immediately ushered the servants out of the bedroom. He hesitated after closing the door behind him, then stood there, feeling impotent and unworthy, as he listened to his mistress\u0027s tormented sobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t know how to help her. Brown straightened his shoulders and hurried down the hall. The welfare of his mistress rested on his shoulders now. He wasn\u0027t going to take any chances. He decided to send six men along instead of four to protect the Marchioness. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lion-s-lady-crown-s-spies-1/page-32.html","bookId":1792,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:35 PM"}
