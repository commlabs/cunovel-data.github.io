I didn\u0027t even mean it or really feel it, but I couldn\u0027t stop. I could waste time analyzing that, but I won\u0027t. It got me out of the essay and it\u0027s getting me a dog. That\u0027s all that matters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The moment got away from me, I guess,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Grey wants more than that, like last time, and even though I\u0027m kind of bored, like last time, I don\u0027t want to overextend myself. I need that energy to take pictures with Jake after the bell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFridays are turning out to be a major pain in the ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug. \"Maybe it was because it felt too much like... before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mentioned that last Friday, things feeling like before,\" Grey says. She opens her Parker notebook. \"It seemed to be a good thing then. What\u0027s changed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at the inspirational poster tacked to the wall behind her head. Something about not giving up. Lame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a lot of responsibilities,\" I say. \"I was thinking about it. I was captain of the cheerleading squad, I was a straight A-plus student and, let\u0027s be honest, I was popular. All of that takes a lot of work. I did some stupid things and lost it all, but that also meant I got rid of all those responsibilities and you know what? I liked life a lot better. Before, I was suffocating. So, lately, I\u0027ve been trying for the homework thing, because I want to graduate, but that essay... every time I sat down to write it, I just couldn\u0027t because--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You felt suffocated,\" Grey finishes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s so smart. I mean, I\u0027m so smart. She\u0027s so predictable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I sympathize, Parker, but we can\u0027t make many more allowances for you. As it stands, we\u0027ve--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t asking,\" I say, laughing a little. \"I mean, it\u0027s not like I cried in Lerner\u0027s on purpose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit. It comes out of my mouth wrong, like I did cry on purpose, which I did, but Grey\u0027s obviously not supposed to know that. And of course she catches it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face darkens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ms. Grey!\" I bring my hand to my mouth and try to sound scandalized, to diffuse the situation. \"You don\u0027t think I did it on purpose, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that comes out of my mouth wrong, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just don\u0027t learn, do you, Parker?\" She closes her notebook and glares at me. \"You run everyone around in circles--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I run everyone around in circles?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop that.\" She takes off her glasses and rubs her eyes. \"You want everyone to think your problem is what happened over the summer--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, that\u0027s what everyone wants to think--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it is your problem!\" She puts her glasses back on. \"You manipulate. You make it your excuse and that\u0027s exactly how you push it away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe party starts at eight, but I show up early so Chris and I can have sex. Another year at St. Peter\u0027s is almost behind us and we\u0027ve already slept together eight times. This will be the ninth and there\u0027s going to be a lot more sex in our future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe go to his bedroom. The speakers are mounted against his window and he turns on some sweet- sounding music really low and he kisses me and I kiss him back and then, I don\u0027t know, I kind of seize up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t even make any sense,\" I tell Grey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s the last thing I tell her. We sit in silence until the bell rings. I feel like I should be furious with her, and I might be, but more than that, I\u0027m annoyed. I have to remind myself she wasn\u0027t there and she doesn\u0027t know a damn thing so I can\u0027t really blame her for making half-assed assertions once a week. I just wish she wouldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I get out, Jake\u0027s waiting for me at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got the camera,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe head outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t believe he goes on my stupid bus and I didn\u0027t even notice. \"You can sit where you normally sit,\" I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry; I was going to,\" he replies. \"So do you have any idea--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I have an idea: please stop talking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe climb on the bus. I take my usual seat at the front and he heads for the middle. I rest my head against the window and close my eyes. I don\u0027t mean to, but I fall asleep, and fifteen minutes later Jake\u0027s shaking my shoulder and looking pretty irritated. All through art he pestered me, \"Where are we going? What are we taking pictures of...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think this is your stop,\" he says sarcastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rub my eyes. \"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe inch up the aisle and step onto the street. I can see my house from here, but I don\u0027t want to go through the hassle of introducing Jake to my parents because they\u0027d interpret it all wrong and it\u0027d give them false hope and, like I said before, I don\u0027t do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll go this way.\" I point in the opposite direction. \"If we go down this street, turn left and walk through the park there\u0027s this kind of wooded area. Beyond that, there\u0027s a ravine. We could probably get some really good pictures there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not going to your house first?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want you to know where I live.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs. \"Like I give a damn. But sure, let\u0027s go to the ravine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walk. I don\u0027t know if I should be nice to him or if this technically makes him my guest because we\u0027re near where I live and he has no idea where we are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you and Chris really hit it off, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI keep my voice light and conversational, but Jake still seems to weigh every word like he\u0027s trying to figure out which one of them is poisoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s cool,\" he says after a while. \"I mean, he didn\u0027t treat me like a new kid, you know? We hang.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He and Becky are going out--you know Becky, right? Becky Halprin? She\u0027s captain of the cheerleading squad. Anyway, they had a date last Friday and they\u0027re having another one this weekend, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, Saturday,\" Jake says. \"It\u0027s not really a date, though. A couple of us are going to go shoot some pool at Finn\u0027s, wherever that is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finn Walters?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, you know him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. He\u0027s on the chess team. He\u0027s, like, this superintellectual and yet still cool.\" It could be all the blow he deals in the boys\u0027 washrooms. \"So it\u0027s a night thing, right? When are you going? Around eight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chris says he\u0027ll pick me up at--\" He stops. \"Why? Are you fishing for an invite or something? Because you\u0027re not going to get one from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got better things to do with a Saturday night, but thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like not hanging out with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Walked right into that one, didn\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, you did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe laugh. And then we realize we\u0027re laughing together and then we stop and then it gets awkward. I don\u0027t do awkward well, at least mutual awkwardness, so I snap my fingers to make the feeling go away. And then I can\u0027t stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven after Jake points it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s really annoying,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I kick it up a notch just to bug him and I keep it up until my fingers start to hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe trek through the park and enter the woods beyond it. They\u0027re not like the woods by Chris\u0027s house. They\u0027re a little denser, a little easier to get lost in, but I\u0027m not worried. I like them. Nothing bad happened here and it makes the air less polluted, somehow. It doesn\u0027t make me want to throw up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s really great out here,\" I say without thinking. \"There\u0027s nothing--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shut my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Jake asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. We\u0027ll get good pictures out here, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reaches into his book bag and pulls out his digital camera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But not here--it\u0027s a little farther in. Give me that.\" I hold out my hand and he steps back, clutching the camera to his chest. \"Oh, come on, Jake. I\u0027m not going to steal or break it. I may not respect people, but I do respect their property.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groans and hands it to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must be crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right; you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take it and run and the look on his face is so great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Parker!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe has no choice but to chase after me, and I have a hell of a lead. I can hear my pulse pounding in my ears and the air is cold and sharp in my lungs and I like that. I get to the ravine ages before him, scale the nearest tree--which is also the biggest and the oldest--and wriggle my way along the thickest branch out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one that hovers directly above the thirty-foot drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Jake finally catches up to me, I\u0027m dangling from a pretty precarious angle, nearly upside down, and it probably looks terrifying from where he\u0027s standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it will be so worth this shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you trying to kill yourself?\" he yells, panting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI keep my leg muscles tight around the branch so I don\u0027t, you know, die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I was trying to kill myself, I\u0027d make sure you weren\u0027t here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Parker, get down from there. You\u0027re making me nervous--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pansy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little more...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe branch makes a few disconcerting creaking noises, but I\u0027m going to pretend it\u0027s not giving out under my weight. I hold the camera up to my eye, the view through the lens making me slightly dizzy, and get a good focus on the ravine. The edges of either side of it creep up the corners of the frame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake\u0027s either holding his breath or wetting himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGot it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI right myself, snake backward and hold the camera out. \"Catch!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Parker, no--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let it go. It seems to fall in slow motion. Jake catches it like I knew he would and he starts swearing at me like I knew he would. When he\u0027s finished, he turns the camera on and checks out the shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Decent,\" he mutters. \"But you\u0027re lucky I caught my camera.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe branch I\u0027m on protests a little more. I stand very, very carefully and maneuver my way to a branch on the opposite side. It\u0027s tricky. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cracked-up-to-be/page-7.html","bookId":1897,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:51 PM"}
