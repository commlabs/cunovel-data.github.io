Amongst all the Heavenly Kings from the Blood Red Hell, he was considered one of the top few. However, he did have one flaw.

Even in the Blood Red Hell, his personality was one that garnered hatred. Currently, facing a young man in his twenties like Zhou Weiqing, he truly could not imagine that he could possibly lose. Added on to the fact that he wanted to impress the four Grand Elders, he decided to battle with only one hand.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Weiqing\u0027s smile did not even waver in the slightest.

Without question, they were all clear that the Blood Red Hell’s goal here was to fully exterminate the Heavenly Demon Sect, with the secondary goal of wiping out the Heavenly Bow Empire as well. Under such a circumstance, the number of Blood Red Hell powerhouses here would definitely be a large number.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn a direct head-on clash, their chances of victory was just too small.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eYet, this fight was also unavoidable.

He would continue doing so, weakening them bit by bit until both sides reached a similar power level, then... heh heh…\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIndeed, this type of betting system and tournament style fighting was the best method to weaken the enemy slowly and steadily. More importantly, the unlimited participation was exactly tailored for himself. With the Devour Skill, how could his sustained fighting capabilities be compared to any ordinary powerhouses?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLooking at how this Tianlei was looking down upon his precious disciple, Long Shiya’s heart had already marked him with the death penalty in this fight.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eOn the other side, Wu Yunyue’s feeling was vastly different. He had heard many stories regarding Zhou Weiqing, but this was the first time he was actually working alongside this young man. Although he was still not too familiar with the heights Zhou Weiqing’s strengths had actually reached, at least he was able to stand there speaking so nonchalantly despite the disparity in strength between both sides, even manipulating their opponents to follow his thoughts… this was more than enough to deem him a talent. At least, Wu Yunyue had to admit that when he was still at the Heavenly King stage, he would not have been able to leave his ego aside and smile\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eobsequiously like that.

After all, a top powerhouse who was willing to resort to all means in accomplishing tasks… they were definitely far trickier than any of their peers.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA faint smile crossed Zhou Weiqing\u0027s lips. In contrast to Tian Lei\u0027s arrogance, he gave the impression that he was a little scared, even as he bowed slightly to his opponent.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWith Tianlei’s pride, he naturally would not launch an attack at Zhou Weiqing at such a time.

A thick wave of Fire Attribute energies mixed with the Destruction Aura burst forth from his body, and his entire body seemed to become an exploding fireball. Such an explosive force caused his Heavenly Energy to have the effect of an indiscriminate attack all around. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eEveryone else from both sides had already retreated far away before the fight had begun. A clash between Heavenly Kings and above would affect a large area, and no one wanted to be caught up in the crossfire.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn the instant that Tian Lei flared out, his body had turned around. According to normal logic, when an opponent disappeared in front of him, they would most likely reappear behind him. Even at this point0, Tian Lei was still planning to fight with only a single arm. As such, when he turned around, his right hand moved with a swirl of a fiery dragon appearing, twisting and moving around his body. This fire dragon would protect his body in the meantime, and as soon as he spotted Zhou Weiqing, it could then be used to strike a fatal blow against Zhou Weiqing.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eFurthermore, Tianlei was pleasantly surprised to feel that he had indeed struck his young foe even in the midst of turning around.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe truth was indeed as such. The explosive Fire Attribute energies that burst forth from Tianlei’s body smashed savagely into Zhou Weiqing, who had appeared behind him.

Although they had called it a tournament style fighting, with the current relationship between both sides, killing their opponent was undoubtedly the simplest and most direct method, which would also serve to break the other side’s morale.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe fire dragon slammed into Zhou Weiqing’s body without the slightest deviation, bursting into brilliant flames.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eOn the other side, the Demonic Emperor had closed his eyes.

He had seen Zhou Weiqing getting hit by both his attacks, totally without any Consolidated Equipment. Yet, he had then step out of the flames, and his palms had just landed on his own chest chest.
