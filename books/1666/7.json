Beyond the glass, on the balcony was a shadow so dark it seemed to eclipse the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glass shattered, falling to the floor like tinkling wind chimes, and the shadow drifted inside the apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrost — mother-freaking frost— spread along the kitchen walls, a thin, icy coating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man let go of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHitting the floor on my knees, I doubled over, dragging air into my bruised throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Arum,” said the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled onto my haunches, lifting my head as my lungs worked overtime to replenish the deprived cells. What I saw… oh God…it had to be a hallucination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shadow rushed the attacker, solidifying as it flew through my kitchen. It slammed into the guy with the force of a freight train, knocking him over the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrabbling back against the wall, I lifted my gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cyclone of shadows swirled in place, revealing a form underneath with each vicious turn. Loose papers flew into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe curtains covering the windows billowed. Cheap pictures rattled on the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderneath the black cloud, two legs, a torso, arms, and broad shoulders formed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything in the room stopped. Papers fluttered to the floor like doves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurtains drifted back to the windows. The shadowy cyclone stilled, revealing a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gasp shattered the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter stood where the shadow had been, a tall and imposing force. And he was smiling, a deadly smirk that said he welcomed a fight that he knew he would win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other man was on his feet, hands clenching and unclenching at his sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe golden complexion of my attacker was now a ghastly white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerror filled those diamond-colored eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You really want to do this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter’s deep, smooth voice rolled like thunder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man’s lips pulled back in a snarl, and I almost expected to see fangs protruding from his mouth. There weren’t any, but then the man flew at Hunter, his form blurring around the edges. His whole form flickered in and out like an old TV station losing reception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBright light flooded the room—it came from the man. He was still there, but…but he was made of light. A solid, humanoid form made of light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like Mel had said, I thought dumbly. Like a walking, fucking light bulb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight Bulb reared his arm back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhitish-red light crackled and spit into the air, spinning down his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI recognized the same action from the parking garage and I stopped thinking. Lurching to my feet, I grabbed the bat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything happened so fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flung the bat at Light Bulb with all my strength. It shot through the air like a dagger, flipping over and over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight Bulb’s head whipped in my direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter cursed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight Bulb lifted a hand, catching the bat, handle first. The metal smoked and then collapsed into itself, incinerating into ash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit,” I said, taking a step back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved his hand, and I was off my feet before I could blink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sailed backward like a rag doll, smacking into the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePain sliced through me. I hit the floor, unable to break my fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard the two of them crashing into each other as oblivion washed over me. I fought to stay conscious, knowing that if Light Bulb could blow up cars, incinerate bats, and fling me across the room without touching me, there was a good chance Hunter would fall to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn image flashed among the disjointed thoughts that were colliding in my brain —my mom. I didn’t know why I saw her. Maybe it was because I had always thought of her as being the strongest person I’d known. Mom had hung on to life after the robbery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was a hell of a fighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held on to that image of her as my fingers dug into the carpet. Aching deep in my bones, I pulled myself up, hurting all over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight Bulb and Hunter were still fighting, the latter delivering blows so fast that Light Bulb had a hard enough time just staying on his feet. They went at each other in a macabre dance; Light Bulb’s light blinding while Hunter, still looking like Hunter, casting deep, unforgiving shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpinning around, Hunter caught Light Bulb by the back of the neck and flipped him over his shoulder, pile driving him into the floor. Hunter was astride Light Bulb within a heartbeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder him, Light Bulb’s form flickered and then the light faded, revealing the man. “Do it, you leech. But you can’t—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter gripped the man by the throat, forcing his head back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not interested in last speeches. Time to kiss your ass good-bye, Lite- Brite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Hunter lowered his other hand to Glow Stick’s chest. From my huddled position, it looked like half of Hunter’s arm had suddenly turned to smoke and then disappeared, but then, as I pushed up into a sitting position, I saw what Hunter had done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arm had become less solid, and the hand — HOLY SHIT—the hand went through Glow Stick’s chest and was inside it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smacked my hand across my mouth, muffling my scream. I wasn’t sure what to be more freaked out about in this whole fucked-up situation—that Light Bulb wanted to kill me? Or that he was a Light Bulb? Or that Hunter could apparently shadow poof and put his hand inside someone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe options were limitless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight Bulb reared off the floor, his mouth gaping in a silent scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter leaned over him, keeping his head in line with Light Bulb’s. It seemed like he was inhaling. Whatever he was doing had Light Bulb flickering in and out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Hunter reared back, pulling his arm out of Light Bulb. Fully solid, his arms fell to his side. The hollows of his cheeks were flushed as if he’d been sun-kissed. Hunter opened his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let out a ragged breath, pressing against the wall. If he could do that to Light Bulb, what in the hell could he do to me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the floor, Light Bulb wasn’t moving. The light had faded, leaving a pearly shell that had human form but reminded me of jellyfish. Networks of veins were visible on the arms and legs. Light Bulb even had fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight Bulb was also most definitely dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter rose fluidly, his pale eyes fixed on mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYep. He was inhuman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat might have been the exact moment when I decided I’d blown past the acceptable level of bizarreness for the day, but I was there, knee-deep in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped around the body of Light Bulb and stopped in front of me. “I do believe I told you to go straight home, Miss Cross.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI struggled to my feet, swaying to the side as I inched away. Every part of me ached and it hurt to stand. “Don’t come near me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne single brow went up. “Wasn’t planning on it, but I at least thought there’d be a ‘thank you for saving my life’ statement thrown in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not human,” I said slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And that obviously has nothing to do with the fact I saved your life,” he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe not, but I was beyond caring. There was a dead… something on my floor and a whatever standing in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, but please—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That didn’t sound sincere, but it doesn’t matter. We—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had taken a step toward me, and I shrieked, “Don’t touch me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter exhaled loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We really don’t have time for this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I could see was his hand disappearing into Light Bulb’s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePressure clamped down on my heart as I continued to make my way toward the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not human,” I mumbled again, because I needed to hear it to process it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes, face tight with impatience; and when his eyes reopened, the obsidian pupils seemed to expand. “I’m pretty sure we’ve covered that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy chest rose and fell rapidly. “What…what are you?” My gaze dropped to the other thing. “What is that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause, and then he nodded at the prone form on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s an alien. I’m an alien. We’re aliens. Aliens everywhere, actually, which is why we have to leave. I’m sure someone has called the police by now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him. “Aliens?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter nodded. “Aliens.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth opened and I was pretty sure I was going to scream, because at that moment, it seemed like the only logical thing to do. Scream. Why not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were aliens everywhere apparently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter shot forward, gripping my shoulders. “I really don’t have time for this. We don’t have time for this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tugged me against his chest and lowered his head, angling it in a way that his mouth lined with mine. For a wild second, I thought he was going to kiss me. The funny thing was what flashed through my mind in that moment was that I didn’t know him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that I was about to be kissed by an alien—or a murderous alien.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem was that I didn’t know him. Yeah, I was officially cracked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter’s lips didn’t touch mine, but it almost felt like they did. I could feel their coolness, and in the back of my mind I wondered how they would feel and taste. And then, his mouth was on mine. His lips were cool and firm. My startled gasp opened my mouth to his. He tasted like winter snow and something dark and rich, like chocolate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he wasn’t kissing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHunter inhaled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt probably made me a son of a bitch to do this to her, especially considering I was in charge of keeping her safe, which by the way was ironically laughable, and in her vulnerable state, it wouldn’t help things. Not to mention this just proved my whole lack of self- control issue. Patience was a virtue I found pointless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we really didn’t have time for her dramatics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stir of energy around her was a deep violet, which meant she really was about to go off the deep end. Totally understandable—there was a dead alien on her floor. But when I’d grabbed and pulled her close, there was something else swirling in her energy fields. Thin slivers of red broke through the violet; the hallmark of arousal. It wasn’t a lot. Serena wasn’t going to drop her panties and jump me, but it was there. And that made me very curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy kind did like to covet pretty, little things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was frozen in my arms, eyes wide, when I brought my mouth down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer full lips, shaped like a pouty bow, were incredibly soft and warm. I wanted to investigate that, discover if they could be demanding and hungry, but there wasn’t time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slid a hand to her chest, my palm resting just below her breasts. The tips of my fingers brushed the heavy swells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery distracting. To most the move looked like one of pure dominance, and in a way, it was. But it was also necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI inhaled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFed as I was off the Luxen, taking from a human would be like getting a cheeseburger off the dollar menu when you just had filet, but…damn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSerena’s taste—the heightened emotions and adrenaline pumping through her—was exquisite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarmth poured into me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike with Luxen or hybrids—humans mutated by the Luxen—I didn’t pick up any memories or emotions. With them, one never knew what you were going to get. Usually it was something the Luxen or hybrid was stressing over, a memory they kept rehashing. The one I just killed had been smart. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/obsession/page-7.html","bookId":1666,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:57 PM"}
