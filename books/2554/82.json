Just ahead, the Manhattan skyline loomed above the entrance to the Midtown Tunnel, while his impatient passenger waited behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had heard from the Manhattan brothers who investigated the Connell woman\u0027s apartment. Neither she nor the Compendium had been in evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now word from New Jersey. Some of the information was puzzling, and even a little disturbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was from the brothers who checked the Johnson Lodge. They found two men and a woman in the basement. The woman\u0027s description fits Louise Connell. Descriptions of the men are vague, but they easily could have been Jack and the woman\u0027s brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were they doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere was the puzzling part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"According to the brother I just spoke to, they were digging.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were they.\" A statement rather than a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. They appeared to have been digging in an excavation beneath the basement of the Lodge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would put them in the ruins of the buried town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe One had been very interested in the town when he had quizzed Ernst about Jack\u0027s boyhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. The brother told me that the High Council had authorized the dig and sent an emissary named Kristof Szeto to initiate it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did they find anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone - they don\u0027t know whether it was Jack and his friends or the workers Szeto hired - but someone unearthed the large, damaged sigil that has been down there longer than the Lodge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been largely forgotten over the years. Ernst hadn\u0027t thought about it in a long, long time - not since the 1980s when he\u0027d researched the Johnson Lodge before visiting it. The sigil had been found in ancient times. The brothers back then had no use for a damaged symbol of the Order but did not feel right discarding such a relic. So they stored it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we must assume the Heir saw it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No assumption necessary: He directed the brothers to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe One made no reply. He remained silent as they entered the Midtown Tunnel. Ernst glanced in the rearview mirror and saw him staring out the window, his expression unreadable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does that particular sigil have a special significance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice seemed to come from far away. \"It belonged to me back in the First Age.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst stiffened in his seat. What a remarkable revelation. That explained the One\u0027s interest in it when Ernst had mentioned it during his quizzing about Jack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If only we\u0027d known, it would have been displayed all these centuries in a place of honor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am glad it wasn\u0027t. I had thought it lost forever.\" He seemed full of sudden determination as he leaned forward. \"When we reach the city, turn downtown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnst knew better than to ask why. But then the One answered his question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must feed.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-82.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
