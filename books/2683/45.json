And they\u0027re all existing in this freezing, screwy-looking loft where DAT tapes and CDs are scattered everywhere, MTV\u0027s on, Presidents of the United States merging into a Mentos commercial merging into an ad for the new Jackie Chan movie, empty Zen Palate take-out boxes are strewn all over the place, white roses dying in an empty Stoli bottle, a giant sad rag-doll photo by Mike Kelly dominates one wall, the collected works of Philip K. Dick fill an entire row in the room\u0027s only bookcase, Lava lamps, cans of Play-Doh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a deep breath, enter the room casually, brush some confetti off my jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept Fitz, they all look up, and Aztec immediately starts strumming something from Tommy on his Fender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He seems to be completely unreceptive,\" Aztec sings-talks. \"The tests I gave him show no sense at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His eyes react to light-the dials detect it,\" Conrad chimes in. \"He hears but cannot answer to your call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up,\" I yawn, grabbing an ice beer out of the fridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His eyes can see, his ears can hear, his lips speak,\" Aztec continues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the time the needles flick and rock,\" Conrad admits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No machine can give the kind of stimulation,\" Fergy points out, \"needed to remove his inner block.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is happening in his head?\" the three of them sing out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ooh I wish I knew,\" Fitzgerald calls from the beanbag chair for one lucid moment. \"I wish I kneeeeew.\" He immediately rolls over into a fetal position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re late,\" Conrad snaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m late?
