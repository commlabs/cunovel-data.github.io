It wasn’t just a question of being able to pull this off with the finesse required; it also meant lowering her guard, opening her heart to the truth. She was attracted to him, both physically and emotionally. Otherwise she wouldn’t have participated in or enjoyed the few times they’d kissed. The most important factor wasn’t her ability to fool Immigration, but resurrecting the shield protecting her against the pull she felt toward Alek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo complicate matters, the attachment she felt was growing stronger every day. She often found herself thinking about him. Hard as it was to admit, Julia had discovered she enjoyed his company and looked forward to the short time they spent together in the evenings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re sure?” Jerry asked, sounding as if he thought she was anything but.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Positive,” she said, chancing a look in Alek’s direction. He caught her eye and smiled reassuringly. Taking her hand, he squeezed her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll do just fine,” Alek said to Jerry. “Wait and see. What both of you fail to realize is that Julia and I did marry for love.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop pacing,” Alek said, more testily than he intended. The Immigration officer was due in fifteen minutes and Julia was understandably nervous. Unable to sit still, she stalked the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Walking helps take my mind off the interview,” Julia snapped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tension between them was thick enough to slice and serve for dinner. That would hurt their case more than anything they said or did. The man or woman doing the interview would sense the strain immediately and count it against them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should know more about me,” Julia said, whirling around to face him as if this was a new thought. “The brand of toothpaste I use and stuff like that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be ridiculous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not…. That’s exactly the kind of questions he’ll ask.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Julia, my love,” he said patiently, “a man doesn’t pay attention to such things. Now relax.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How can you be so calm?” Julia shrugged, raising both hands. “Our future hinges on the outcome of this meeting. There’s a very real possibility I could go to jail for involving myself in this…marriage.” Her arms seemed to have lost their purpose and fell lifelessly to her sides. “I’m not the only one who has a lot at stake with this. Your mother and sister’s plans depend on the outcome, as well. Didn’t you mention you’ve already seen to the necessary paperwork for them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m aware of the consequences.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then how can you be so calm?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very simple, my love.” He said this evenly and without emotion as he leaned forward, clasped her around the waist and brought her down into his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia struggled at first. “Stop,” she said, wriggling against him. “What are you trying to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let her struggle, but her efforts were weak. His arms were around her and he felt her yielding. Taking advantage of her acquiescence, he brushed his face against her hair. She’d left it down, at his request, and he gathered the length of it in his hands, loving its clean jasmine scent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alek, are you insane?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped a trail of moist kisses along her throat and shoulder. “That’s better,” he whispered as her tight muscles relaxed. “Much better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…I don’t think we should be doing this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” he asked as his hand caressed her back in a slow, soothing motion. “This?” He eased her against the chair until her hair spilled over his arm. A sigh escaped her as he pressed his lips to hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia felt hot, then cold and shaky in his embrace, but no more so than he. They’d kissed a handful of times and each had been a battle for him. His wife had balked at his touch in the beginning, then gradually she’d opened herself to him until he was so needy he ached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time the skirmish between them was over even before it started. Julia accepted his kiss with little more than a token protest. Perhaps she was ready for more.…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe broke off the kiss and told her how badly he needed her. He pleaded with her as only a man who needs his wife can implore. It wasn’t until he saw the confusion in her eyes that he realized he’d spoken in his native tongue. His English was hopeless just then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia’s fingers were digging into his shoulders. He felt the rapid beat of her heart and heard the ragged echo of her breath as it rasped in his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorbell chimed and Alek would have ignored it if Julia hadn’t frozen and then jumped from his lap as though she’d caught fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, my goodness,” she cried. Her face was a rich shade of red as she swept back her hair. “The interviewer is here.” She stared at him as if he had the magical power to make everything right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That would be my guess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alek.” Her voice shook as she quickly adjusted her clothes. “I’m scared.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be. Everything will be fine,” he said. He gave her a moment to fuss with her hair before he stood, kissed her lightly on the lips and answered the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Alek appeared outwardly composed, he was as shaken as Julia. And not because their future hung in the balance. His head reeled with the aftershock of their kissing. A few kisses, he’d thought, to take the edge off their nervousness. In another five minutes, he would’ve carried her to his bed.…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello,” Alek said, opening the door to admit a lanky, official-looking gentleman. He wore a crisp business suit and from the tight set of his mouth, Alek guessed he would brook no foolishness. His expression was sharp and unfriendly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Patrick O’Dell,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My name is Alek and this is my wife, Julia,” Alek said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia stood on the far side of the room, her smile fleeting and strained. “Welcome to our home, Mr. O’Dell. Would you care to sit down?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.” He moved into the living room and didn’t pause to look at the view. Indeed, there might not have been one for all the notice O’Dell took. He sat on the recliner they’d recently vacated and set his briefcase on the coffee table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek walked over to Julia’s side and held her hand in his. Together they ventured to the sofa opposite the interviewer and sat down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. O’Dell removed a file from his briefcase. He scanned the contents, then frowned with clear disapproval. “How did you two meet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Through my brother,” Julia said quickly. “He’d met Alek several years earlier while he was in Europe. They corresponded for a number of years and then after the fire…” She hesitated and turned to Alek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jerry offered me a job in this country almost three years ago. I’ve lived here for the past two.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me about your work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek answered the questions thoroughly, while minimizing his importance to Conrad Industries. No need to raise suspicions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alek is a gifted biochemist,” Julia added with unnecessary enthusiasm. “The company was nearly ruined a few years back following the fire I mentioned. I don’t know what would’ve become of us if it hadn’t been for Alek.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he smiled, Alek was groaning inwardly. Julia was offering far more information than necessary. He wished now that they’d gone over what they planned to say. Jerry had advised them to do so, but Alek had felt spontaneity would serve them better than a series of practiced responses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In other words, you needed Mr. Berinski.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, very much so.” Julia was nothing if not honest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you continue to need him?” the interviewer pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Alek answered before Julia could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I disagree,” she returned, looking briefly at Alek. “I find we need him more than ever now. The new line of paints Alek’s been working on for the past two years is ready to be marketed. That’s only the beginning of the ideas he’s developing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek’s concern mounted as O’Dell made a notation. Julia really was as bad at pretense as she’d claimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My husband has worked hard on this project. He deserves to reap the fruits of his labors.” Fortunately, Julia didn’t stumble over the word husband. She’d said it a number of times since their marriage and it always seemed to cause her difficulty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You give me more credit than I deserve, my dear,” he murmured, feeling they’d dug themselves into a pit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nonsense,” Julia said, obviously warming to her subject. “Alek is a genius.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother notation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek squeezed Julia’s fingers, willing her to stop speaking, but the more he tried to discourage her, the more she went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you two held each other in such high esteem, why did you wait until Alek’s visa had almost expired before you agreed to marry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Love isn’t always planned,” Julia answered quickly. “No one completely understands matters of the heart, do they? I know I didn’t.” She glanced shyly toward Alek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand why the Immigration department is suspicious of our marriage,” Alek added. “We realized you would be when we decided to go ahead and marry. It didn’t make any difference.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother notation, this one made with sharp jagged movements of his pen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were several more questions, which they answered as forthrightly as possible. Alek was uncertain of how well they were coming across. He’d rarely heard Julia sound more animated and, to his surprise, sincere. When he’d first learned of the interview, his biggest concern had been Julia, but now he suspected she’d be his strongest asset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he was forced to return to Russia, Alek would go, because he had no other choice. He hadn’t dwelled on the consequences, refusing to allow any negative suggestions to enter his mind. He realized as they were speaking how much he’d hate to leave Julia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think that answers everything,” O’Dell said, closing his file and placing it back in his briefcase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe unexpectedness of his announcement caught Alek off guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s all?” Apparently Julia was as astonished as he was. “You don’t want to know what brand of toothpaste Alek uses or about his personal habits?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe official smiled for the first time. “We leave that sort of interrogation for the movies. It’s obvious to me that you two care deeply for each other. I wish all my assignments were as easy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will I need to sign anything?” Julia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” O’Dell said as he stood. “I’ll file my report by the end of the week. I don’t believe there’s any reason for us to be in further contact with you. I appreciate your agreeing to see me on such short notice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlek stood in order to escort Mr. O’Dell to the door. Julia seemed to be in a state of shock. She sat on the sofa, her mouth hanging open, staring up at the official with a baffled, uncertain look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you again for your trouble,” Patrick O’Dell said when Alek opened the front door. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/an-engagement-in-seattle/page-11.html","bookId":1964,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:38 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:38 AM"}
