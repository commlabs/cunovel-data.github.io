A brief smile touched his lips. \"Maybe that\u0027s why you\u0027re director.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still against me?\" asked Coogan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smile left Sil-Chan\u0027s mouth. \"It\u0027s suicide, Vince.\" He hitched himself forward. \"If we follow your orders, when this Adams says to destroy the Library, we\u0027d have to help him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we would,\" said Coogan. \"But it\u0027s not going to come to that. I wish you\u0027d trust me, Toris.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you were doing something that even remotely made sense, of course I would,\" said Sil-Chan. \"But --\" He shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve a job for you,\" said Coogan. \"It may or may not make sense, but I want it carried out to the letter. Take any ship you can get and hop to this Sextus C III in the Mundial Group. When you get there, I want you to prove that the Yoo Clan killed Leader Adams\u0027 father. I don\u0027t care whether it\u0027s true or not. I want the proof.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That makes sense,\" said Sil-Chan. \"If we can discredit the big boss --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visor chimed. Coogan hit the switch and a sub-librarian\u0027s face appeared in the screen. \"Sir,\" the man blurted, \"the Library information broadcasts are silent! I just got a call from --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Orders of the government,\" said Coogan. \"It\u0027s quite all right. Return to your duties.\" He blanked the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSil-Chan was leaning on the desk, fists clenched. \"You mean you let them close us down without a struggle.\" \"Let me remind you of some things,\" said Coogan. \"We must obey the government to survive. I am director here and I\u0027ve given you an order. Get on it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if I refuse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get somebody else to do it and you\u0027ll be locked up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t leave me any choice.\" He turned and slammed out of the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty-four times the evening rains passed across the tower far above Coogan\u0027s office. The game of cat-and-mouse with Pchak went on as usual, the little brown general delving deeper and deeper into the files. On the twenty-fifth day Coogan came into his office in mid afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePchak is completely hooked, he thought, but what happens when Adams finds out the Library hasn\u0027t been destroyed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat down at his desk, swiveled to face the control panel and activated a tiny screen linked to a spy cell on the sixty-ninth level. Pchak was in the viewing room, studying the Albireo language preexamining that double-star system\u0027s war history. Behind Coogan, a mechanical hum sounded, indicating someone was emerging from the elevator. Hastily, he blanked the spy screen, turned to his desk just as the door burst open. Toris Sil-Chan staggered into the room, his clothing torn, a dirty bandage over one shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mundial native lurched across the room, clutched the edge of Coogan\u0027s desk. \"Hide me!\" he said. \"Quick!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoogan jerked around to the panel, swung it open and motioned toward the hole that was exposed. Sil-Chan darted in and Coogan closed the panel, returned to his desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain the telltale signaled. Two armed guards burst into the room, blasters in their hands. \"Where is he?\" demanded the first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s who?\" asked Coogan. He squared a stack of papers on his desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The guy who jumped off that lifeboat,\" said the guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about,\" said Coogan, \"but I can see that I\u0027ll have to call General Pchak and tell him how you\u0027ve burst into my office without preamble and --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard lowered his blaster and retreated one step. \"That won\u0027t be necessary, sir,\" he said. \"We can see the man\u0027s not here. He probably went to a lower level. Please excuse the interruption.\" They backed out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoogan waited until his spy relays in the corridor told him the men had gone, then opened the panel. Sil-Chan was crumpled on the floor. Coogan bent over him, shook him. \"Toris! What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSil-Chan stirred, looked up at Coogan with eyes that were at first unrecognizing. \"Uh . . . Vince --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe director put an arm behind Sil-Chan, supported the man to a sitting position. \"Take it easy now. Just tell me what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Made a mess of assignment,\" said Sil-Chan. \"Yoo Clan got wind of what I was after. Had Adams send order . . . arrest. Lost ship. Got away in escape boat. Landed other side . . . planet. Pchak\u0027s guards tried stop --\" His head slumped forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoogan put a hand to the man\u0027s heart, felt its steady pumping. He eased Sil-Chan back to the floor, went out and summoned a hospital robot. Sil-Chan regained consciousness while the robot was listing him. \"Sorry to go out on you like that,\" he said. \"I --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe message visor on the director\u0027s desk chimed. Coogan pushed the response switch, scanned the words of a visual message, blanked the screen and turned back to Sil-Chan. \"You\u0027ll have to be treated here,\" he said. \"Couldn\u0027t risk carrying you through the corridors right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe spy beam hummed at the door. Coogan pushed Sil-Chan behind the panel, closed it. Pchak strode into the office, a blaster in his hand, two guards behind him. The general glanced at the hospital robot, looked at Coogan. \"Where\u0027s the man that robot was called to treat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last guard into the office closed the door, drew his blaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talk or you\u0027ll be cut down where you stand,\" said Pchak. The showdown, thought Coogan. He said, \"These hospital robots are a peculiar kind of creature, general. They don\u0027t have the full prime directive against harming humans because sometimes they have to choose between saving one person and letting another one die. I can tell this robot that if I\u0027m harmed it must give all of you an overdose of the most virulent poison it carried in its hypo arm. I informed the robot that this action will save my life. It naturally is loyal to the Library and will do exactly what I have just now told it to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePchak\u0027s face tightened. He raised the blaster slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless you wish to die in agony, place your blasters on my desk,\" said Coogan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t,\" said Pchak. \"Now what\u0027re you going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your blasters can kill me,\" said Coogan, \"but they won\u0027t stop that robot until it has carried out my order.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePchak\u0027s finger began to tighten on the trigger. \"Then let\u0027s give it the --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sharp blat! of an energy bolt filled the room. Pchak slumped. The guard behind him skirted the robot fearfully, put his blaster on Coogan\u0027s desk. The weapon smelled faintly of ozone from the blast that had killed Pchak. \"Call that thing off me now,\" said the man, staring at the robot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoogan looked at the other guard. \"You, too,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other man came around behind the robot, put his weapon on the desk. Coogan picked up one of the weapons. It felt strange in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not going to turn that thing loose on us now, are you?\" asked the second guard. He seemed unable to take his gaze from the robot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoogan glanced down at the scarab shape of the mechanical with its flat pad extensors and back hooks for carrying a stretcher. He wondered what the two men would do if he told them the thing Pchak had undoubtedly known -- that the robot could take no overt action against a human, that his words had been a lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first guard said, \"Look, we\u0027re on your side now. We\u0027ll tell you everything. Just before he came down here, Pchak got word that Leader Adams was coming and --\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adams!\" Coogan barked the word. He thought, Adams coming! How to turn that to advantage? He looked at the first guard. \"You were with Pchak when he came the first day, weren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was his personal guard,\" said the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoogan scooped the other blaster off his desk, backed away. \"All right. When Adams lands, you get on that visor and tell him Pchak wishes to see him down here. With Adams a hostage, I can get the rest to lay down their arms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But --\" said the guard. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/direct-descent/page-6.html","bookId":1571,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:50:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:50:33 PM"}
