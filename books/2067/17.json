Seriously,\" Bonnie said happily, skipping along with her hand in Zander\u0027s. \"I am, like, the Queen of Quarters. Who knew I had this hidden talent?\" Laughing, Zander threw his arm around her shoulders and pul ed her closer. \"You are pretty awesome,\" he agreed. \"Drinking games, visions, astrology. Any other skil s I should know about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnuggling against him, Bonnie frowned in mock concentration. \"Not that I can think of. Just be aware of my general wonderfulness.\" His T-shirt was soft and worn, and Bonnie tilted her head a bit to rest her cheek against it. \"I\u0027m glad we got our friends together,\" she said. \"I thought Marcus and Meredith real y hit it off, didn\u0027t you? Not romantical y, at al , which is good since Meredith has a super-serious boyfriend, but it was like they shared the same secret jock language. Maybe we can al hang out in a group again sometime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, Meredith and Marcus real y bonded over their workouts,\" Zander agreed, but there was a hesitation in his voice that made Bonnie stop walking and peer up at him sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you like my friends?\" she asked, hurt. She and Meredith and Elena had always had what they privately cal ed a \"velociraptor sisterhood.\" Cross one of them and the other two would close in to protect her. Zander had to like them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I liked them a lot,\" Zander assured her. He hesitated, then added, \"Elena seemed kind of ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003euncomfortable, though. Maybe we\u0027re not the kind of people she likes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie stiffened. \"Are you cal ing my best friend a snob?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZander stroked her back appeasingly. \"Sort of, I guess. I mean, nice, but just kind of a snob. The nicest kind of snob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just want her to like me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not a snob,\" Bonnie said indignantly. \"And even if she was, she\u0027s got a lot to be a snob about. She\u0027s beautiful and smart and one of the best friends I\u0027ve ever had. I\u0027d do anything for her. And she\u0027d do anything for me, too. So it doesn\u0027t matter if she\u0027s a snob,\" she concluded, glaring at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come here,\" Zander said. They were near the music building, and he pul ed her into the lit alcove by the front door. \"Sit with me?\" he asked, settling on the brick steps and tugging her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie sat down, but she was determined not to snuggle up to him again. Instead, she kept a distance between them and stared stubbornly out at the night, her jaw firmly set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, Bonnie,\" Zander said, pushing a long strawberry blonde curl out of her eyes. \"I\u0027l get to know Elena better, and I\u0027m sure I\u0027l like her. I\u0027l get her to like me, too. You know why I\u0027m going to get to know her better?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, why?\" said Bonnie, reluctantly looking at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I want to know you better. I\u0027m planning on spending a lot of time with you, Bonnie McCul ough.\" He nudged her gently with his shoulder, and Bonnie melted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZander\u0027s eyes were so blue, blue like morning on the very first day of summer vacation. There was intel igence and laughter with just a touch of a wild longing in them. He leaned in closer, and Bonnie was sure he was about to kiss her, their first kiss at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tilted her head back to meet his lips, her eyelashes fluttering closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment of waiting for a kiss that didn\u0027t come, she sat up again and opened her eyes. Zander was staring past her, out into the darkness of the campus, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie cleared her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" he said, \"sorry, Bonnie, I got distracted for a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Distracted?\" Bonnie echoed indignantly. \"What do you mean you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hang on a sec.\" Zander put a finger to her lips, shushing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you hear something?\" Bonnie asked, uneasy tingles creeping up her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZander got to his feet. \"Sorry, I just remembered something I have to do. I\u0027l catch up with you later, okay?\" With a halfhearted wave, not even looking at Bonnie, he loped off into the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie\u0027s mouth dropped open. \"Wait!\" she said, scrambling to her feet. \"Are you just going to leave me here\" - Zander was gone - \"alone?\" she finished in a tiny voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat. Bonnie walked out to the middle of the path, looked around, and waited a minute to see if there was any sign of Zander coming back. But there was no one in sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t even hear his footsteps anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were pools of light beneath the street lamps on the path, but they didn\u0027t reach very far. A breeze rustled the leaves of the trees on the quad, and Bonnie shivered. No sense in standing here, Bonnie thought, and she started walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first few steps down the path toward her dorm, Bonnie was real y angry, hot and humiliated. How could Zander have been such a flake? How could he leave her al alone in the middle of the night, especial y after al the attacks and disappearances on campus? She kicked viciously at a pebble in her path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few steps further on, Bonnie stopped being so angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was too scared; the fear was pushing the anger out of her. She should have headed back to the dorm when Meredith and Elena did, but she\u0027d assured them, gaily, that Zander would walk her back. How could he have just left her? She wrapped her arms around herself tightly and went as fast as she could without actual y running, her stupid high-heeled going-out-dancing shoes pinching and making the bal s of her feet ache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was real y late; most of the other people who lived on campus must be tucked into their beds by now. The silence was unsettling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the footsteps began behind her, it was even worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t sure she was real y hearing them at first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGradual y, she became aware of a faint, quick padding in the distance, someone moving lightly and fast. She paused and listened, and the footsteps grew louder and faster stil .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone was running toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie sped up, stumbling over her feet in her haste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer shoes skidded on a loose stone in the path and she fel , catching herself on her hands and one knee. The impact stung sharply enough to bring tears to her eyes, but she kicked off her shoes, not caring that she was leaving them behind. She scrambled up and ran faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe footsteps of her pursuer were louder now, starting to catch up. Their rhythm was strange: loud periodic footfal s with quicker, lighter beats in between. Bonnie realized with horror that there was more than one person chasing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer foot skidded again, and she barely caught her balance, staggering sideways a few steps to keep from fal ing, losing more ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA heavy hand fel on Bonnie\u0027s shoulder, and she screamed and whipped around, her fists raised in a desperate bid to defend herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bonnie!\" Meredith gasped, clutching Bonnie\u0027s shoulders. \"What are you doing out here by yourself?\" Samantha came up beside them, carrying Bonnie\u0027s shoes, and doubled over, panting for breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are way too fast for me, Meredith,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie swal owed a sob of relief. Now that she was safe, she felt like sitting down and having hysterics. \"You scared me,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeredith looked furious. \"Remember how we promised to stick together?\" Meredith\u0027s gray eyes were stormy. \"You were supposed to stay with Zander until you got home safely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonnie, about to respond heatedly that it hadn\u0027t been her choice to be out here alone, suddenly closed her mouth and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Meredith knew that Zander had left Bonnie out here by herself, she would never, never forgive him. And Bonnie was mad at Zander for leaving her, but she wasn\u0027t quite that mad, not mad enough to turn Meredith against him. Maybe he had an explanation. And she stil wanted that kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Bonnie said abjectly, staring down at her feet. \"You\u0027re right, I should have known better.\" Mol ified, Meredith swung an arm over Bonnie\u0027s shoulders. Samantha silently handed Bonnie her shoes, and Bonnie pul ed them back on. \"Let\u0027s walk Samantha back to her dorm, and then we\u0027l go home together,\" she said forgivingly. \"You\u0027l be okay with us.\" Around the corner from her room, Elena sagged and leaned against the hal way wal for a moment. It had been a long, long night. There had been drinks, and dancing with the huge shaggy-haired Spencer who, as Samantha had warned her, did try to pick Elena up and swing her around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings got loud and aggravating, and the whole time, her heart hurt. She wasn\u0027t sure she wanted to navigate the world without Stefan. It\u0027s just for now, she told herself, straightening up and plodding around the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hel o, princess,\" said Damon. Elena stiffened in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLounging on the floor in front of her door, Damon somehow managed to look sleek and perfectly poised in what would have been an awkward position for anyone else. As she recovered from the shock of his being there at al , Elena was surprised by the burst of joy that rose up in her chest at the sight of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrying to ignore that happy little hop inside her, she said flatly, \"I told you I didn\u0027t want to see you for a while, Damon.\" Damon shrugged and rose graceful y to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darling, I\u0027m not here to plead for your hand.\" His eyes lingered on her mouth for a moment, but then he went on in a dry and detached tone. \"I\u0027m just checking in on you and the little redbird, making sure you haven\u0027t disappeared with whatever\u0027s gone sour on this campus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re fine,\" Elena said shortly. \"Here I am, and Bonnie\u0027s new boyfriend is walking her home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"New boyfriend?\" Damon asked, raising one eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d always had - something - some connection with Bonnie, Elena knew, and she guessed his ego might not be thril ed to have her moving past the little crush she\u0027d focused on him. \"And how did you get home?\" Damon asked acidly. \"I notice you haven\u0027t picked up a new boyfriend to protect you. Not yet, anyway.\" Elena flushed and bit her lip but refused to rise to the bait. \"Meredith just left to patrol around campus. I notice you didn\u0027t ask about her. Don\u0027t you want to make sure she\u0027s safe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon snorted. \"I pity any ghoul that goes after that one,\" he said, sounding more admiring than anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I come in? Note that I\u0027m being courteous again, waiting for you out here in this dingy hal way instead of comfortably on your bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can come in for a minute,\" Elena said grudgingly, and opened her bag to rummage for her keys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh. She felt a sudden pang of heartache. At the top of her bag, rather crushed and wilted now, was the daisy she\u0027d found outside her door at the beginning of the evening. She touched it gently, reluctant to push it aside in the hunt for her keys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A daisy,\" said Damon dryly. \"Very sweet. You don\u0027t seem to be taking much care of it, though.\" Purposely ignoring him, Elena grabbed her keys and snapped the bag shut. \"So you think the disappearances and attacks are because of ghouls? Do you mean something supernatural?\" she asked, unlocking the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you find out, Damon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShrugging, Damon fol owed her into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" he answered grimly. \"But I certainly don\u0027t think the missing kids just freaked out and went home or to Daytona Beach or something. I think you need to be careful.\" Elena sat down on her bed, drew her knees up, and rested her chin on them. \"Have you used your Power to try to figure out what\u0027s going on?\" she asked. \"Meredith said she would ask you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon sat down next to her and sighed. \"Beloved, as little as I like to admit it, even my Power has limits,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If someone is much stronger than me, like Klaus was, he can hide himself. If someone is much weaker, he doesn\u0027t usual y make enough of an impression for me to find him unless I already know who he is. And for some ridiculous reason\" - he scowled - \"I can never sense werewolves at al .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you can\u0027t help?\" Elena said, dismayed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I didn\u0027t say that,\" Damon said. He touched a loose strand of Elena\u0027s golden hair with one long finger. \"Pretty,\" he said absently. \"I like your hair pul ed back like this.\" She twitched away from him, and he dropped his hand. \"I\u0027m looking into it,\" he went on, his eyes gleaming. \"I haven\u0027t had a good hunt in far too long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena wasn\u0027t sure that she ought to find this comforting, but she did, in a kind of scary way. \"You\u0027l be relentless, then?\" she asked, a little chil going through her, and he nodded, his long black lashes half veiling his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was so sleepy and felt happier now that she\u0027d seen Damon, although she knew she shouldn\u0027t have let him in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe missed him, too. \"You had better go,\" she said, yawning. \"Let me know what you find out.\" Damon stood, hesitating by the end of her bed. \"I don\u0027t like leaving you alone here,\" he said. \"Not with everything that\u0027s been happening. Where are those friends of yours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027l be here,\" Elena said. Something generous in her made her add, \"But if you\u0027re that worried, you can sleep here if you want.\" She\u0027d missed him, she had, and he was being a perfect gentleman. And she had to admit, she would feel safer with him there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can?\" Damon quirked a wicked eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the floor,\" Elena said firmly. \"I\u0027m sure Bonnie and Meredith wil be glad for your protection, too.\" It was a lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Bonnie would be thril ed to see him, there was a decent chance Meredith would kick him on purpose as she crossed the room. She might even put on special pointy-toed boots to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena got up and pul ed down a spare blanket from her closet for him, then headed off to brush her teeth and change. When she came back, al ready for bed, he was lying on the floor, wrapped in the blanket. His eyes lingered for a minute on the curve of her neck leading down to her lacy white nightgown, but he didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena climbed into bed and turned out the light. \"Good night, Damon,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a soft rush of air. Then suddenly he whispered softly in her ear, \"Good night, princess.\" Cool lips brushed her cheek and then were gone. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-moonsong-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-17.html","bookId":2067,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:18:43 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:18:43 AM"}
