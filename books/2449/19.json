He looked across at Timberlake, who sat on the edge of his action couch staring at a memo pad of ship paper. The thin paper rustled faintly as Timberlake folded back a page, scribbled something on a clean surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monitor screen beside Timberlake showed that Bickel had sunk into sleep almost immediately after that strange call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tim, did Bick\u0027s message make sense to you?\" Flattery asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\" Timberlake looked up from his notepad. \"Let\u0027s assume that consciousness involves an organic receptor of some kind which produces a field structure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And this field structure expands and collapses under different stresses,\" Prudence said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimberlake nodded. \"And that field structure itself would be the phenomenon we call consciousness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you two agreeing with him?\" Flattery asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the moment,\" Timberlake said. \"Now, let\u0027s follow this assumption. The organic receptor would be subjected to a constant storm of impressions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And most researchers think the cerebellum is the focus of that storm of impressions,\" Prudence said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s certainly not the seat of consciousness,\" Flattery objected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There may be no seat of consciousness,\" Prudence said. \"We\u0027re talking about a motile phenomenon. It can move by itself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Timberlake said. \"What\u0027s the impression input? What does the cerebellum receive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Electrical inputs of some form,\" Prudence said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.... but how is that input sorted into its receiver?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlattery inhaled a deep breath, caught at last by the feeling of the hunt with the quarry near. Was it possible that this crew would succeed? He grew conscious that Prudence had asked him a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you understand this concept? We\u0027re talking about electroform inputs of nerve-impulse groups and each group would be of extremely short duration.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the groups wouldn\u0027t be absolutely discrete,\" Flattery said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not,\" she said. \"It\u0027s like the ambiguity of light. Sometimes the physicist has to think of light as waves and sometimes as particles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wavicles,\" Flattery said, his tone musing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. So sometimes we think of these nerve-impulse groups as discrete units, particles, and sometimes we think of them as a continuous flow... waves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Track that discrete flow for me,\" Timberlake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced away from the big console, studied Timberlake. There was no avoiding the excitement in him. With that intuitive sense of his, Timberlake had leaped ahead somewhere and the others were supposed to follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The track\u0027s pretty well plotted,\" Flattery said: \"Action currents are conducted over the cortico-ponto-cerebellar tract. What\u0027re you driving at?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw it then as a diagram in her mind: (1) cortico- (2) ponto- (3) cerebellar. Three phase! Were those the essential three of Bickel\u0027s field-self?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrudence put this thought into words, waited, not knowing quite what to expect from the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three tracks, not one,\" Flattery mused. \"No... that\u0027s not it.\" Then, pouncing: \"Holographic!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A holographic field,\" Prudence said. She saw that Flattery, too, had been caught up in Timberlake\u0027s excitement. But the board demanded her full attention for a moment and it was only later that she realized she had missed some silent exchange between Flattery and Timberlake - perhaps a knowing look, a nod...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresently, Timberlake said: \"I want you to say it. What\u0027s the terminal point of all that input?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It goes into the silent or nonfunctional areas of the cerebellum,\" Prudence said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlattery felt a need to expand on this. \"That\u0027s the superior and inferior lobes, the declive, the folium, and the tuber - the major portion of the cerebellum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mediation is across the tract from the cerebral cortex,\" Prudence said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Silent or nonfunctional?\" Timberlake asked. \"Don\u0027t you medical people ever listen to your own words?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" Flattery asked. There was an edge of anger in his tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the potential, the effect?\" Timberlake demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Energy arrives! Does it turn a wheel? Does it turn on a light? You can\u0027t keep piling energy into any system indefinitely without some kind of output... or balancing effect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you said -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the output, the potential, the balancing effect? The energy goes in. What does it do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you suggesting that this... this potential, that it\u0027s consciousness?\" Prudence asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she remembered Bickel calling the field system an \"infinite sponge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlattery cut across this thought. \"Didn\u0027t Bickel say something about consciousness being like the vestibular reflex of the inner ear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The way we balance,\" Timberlake said. \"The thing that tells us which way is down and which way is up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The strangest thing,\" Prudence said. \"I feel as though I\u0027d been a little bit asleep all along, not awake enough to realize what Bickel was driving at.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But now you\u0027re beginning to get it,\" Timberlake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That storm of sense impressions doesn\u0027t stop when you\u0027re asleep,\" Flattery argued. \"Are you trying to tell me that sleep is a form of consciousness?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he spoke, he remembered making the same argument to Bickel, but now he had to be honest with himself and face up to the obvious answer plus everything that the answer implied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course,\" Flattery said. \"Sleep\u0027s a form of consciousness. It just falls near one end of the spectrum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And all that unexplained energy?\" Timberlake insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has to be used for something,\" Flattery said. \"Yes, I see that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Timberlake said. \"The consciousness-effect - field or whatever - may mediate that energy balance. Perhaps it\u0027s a homeostat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All biological control mechanisms are homeostats,\" Prudence said. \"So what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not enough to say that consciousness juggles the storm of sense impressions,\" Flattery said. \"That still leaves your question unanswered, Tim. What happens to the energy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There must be another effect somewhere in the system,\" Timberlake said. \"There has to be an unexplained flow of energy somewhere - or a flow that\u0027s been explained the wrong -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Synergy,\" Prudence said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlattery shot a surprised glance at her. The word had been on the tip of his tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Synergy,\" Timberlake mused. \"Any medical surprises in there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrudence heard the question within the question. The life-systems engineer had a working acquaintance with synergy, but he wanted to know if a medical simplification might help him. Timberlake was sniffing down a hot trail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the effect produced by our spinal reflexes,\" she said. \"Synergy acts through the cerebellum, an extra effect. It\u0027s on the side of the... ahhh, circuit that leads out from the cortex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re looking for an integrating or balancing effect,\" Timberlake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s... possible,\" Flattery said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn\u0027t enough for Timberlake. \"Simple synaptic integration is enough on the side leading toward the cortex. Does synergy involve output from the frontal lobes or the gyrus? Could it account for our missing energy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why the gyrus?\" Flattery asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I keep looking for secondary mediation areas. We don\u0027t dare overlook anything....ave to be right the first time or we go down the tube the same way all the other ships did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going around in circles the same way Bickel does,\" Flattery objected. \"So you narrow down the mediating area to the frontal lobes. So what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimberlake wouldn\u0027t be distracted. \"Lot\u0027s of researchers think the frontal lobes -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine!\" Flattery interrupted. \"No end of good people may\u0027ve suggested that the frontal lobes are the mysterious center of consciousness. But Prue may be closer to it than you are. Motile, remember? There may be no seat of consciousness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimberlake blinked. \"What good does it do to know where it is if you don\u0027t know what it is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlattery pressed him. \"Synergy may not be totally explained, but it\u0027s still useful as a concept. However, if you\u0027re suggesting that synergy is consciousness...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dead end,\" Timberlake said. \"But Bickel thinks we\u0027re after a field-regulating sensor which deals with mental and emotional responses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that\u0027s what\u0027s bothering him! Prudence thought. She said aloud: \"If we\u0027re going to reproduce this thing artificially, whatever we build has to have sensory, mental, and emotional responses to regulate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlattery pressed himself back into his couch. \"Ahhhhh. We can give Bickel\u0027s Ox its sensory and mental responses - but how do we give it emotions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about negative feedback?\" Timberlake asked. \"Emotions always involve a goal. Negative feedback suggests a goal-seeking element in the system.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Consciousness requires a goal?\" Flattery asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe realized by the sudden silence greeting his question that they had lifted themselves to a critical point of this analysis. They could all feel it. Bickel\u0027s challenging ideas had goaded them to this effort and now all of them were poised, sprinters waiting for the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A goal,\" Timberlake whispered. His voice grew louder. \"An object on which to focus.\" He looked at Flattery. \"The field relationship?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClose, but not quite it, Prudence thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlattery said: \"Not an entity or a thing or an area of the brain, but a connecting link between such things or entities or areas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the corner of an eye, Flattery saw Prudence adjust a dial on the big console. He sensed the waiting tensions in her movements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A bridge!\" Timberlake shouted. \"Of course! Of course! A bridge!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A bridge built out of language?\" Prudence asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the symbols are loaded with errors, with weaknesses and flaws,\" Timberlake said. \"That\u0027s it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlattery saw a new quickness and sureness enter Prudence\u0027s movements as she digested this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time spanning,\" she said. \"With words... with symbols.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Flattery thought: There is a gateway to the imagination you must enter before you are conscious and the keys to the gate are symbols. You can carry ideas through the gate from one time-place to another time-place, but you must carry the ideas in symbols. Do you know, though, what you carry... and who it is that carries?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every symbol has hidden premises behind it,\" Flattery said. \"Every word carries unspoken assumptions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the most critical word in the whole problem is the word consciousness,\" Timberlake said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which assumes,\" Prudence said, \"that there is a self to be conscious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A bridge crosses from one place to another place,\" Timberlake went on. \"If it starts breaking down, the engineers get out the original blueprints, the materials orders, and they go to the bridge and examine it. They study the bridge under static conditions and under loads. Then they may replace parts, put in new bracings -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or tear the whole damn thing down and start over,\" said Prudence. \"Didn\u0027t either one of you hear me? Our word assumes there\u0027s a self to be conscious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We heard you,\" Flattery said. \"But there are more important hidden assumptions... than \u0027Know thyself.\u0027 \"What about \u0027Know thy limits\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Limits,\" Timberlake picked up the word. \"At one end - sleep or the sleep of death; and at the other end - waking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the question of Western religion,\" Flattery said, \"is: What lies beyond death? But the question of the Zen master is: What lies beyond waking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For Kee-rist\u0027s sake!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice was Bickel\u0027s and it plunged down onto them from the command-circuit screen overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlattery looked up with a smug smile to find Bickel glaring down at him from the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I leave you for a half-hour, and you lure these poor fools down some mystical dead end! Tossing labels around just like those jackasses back at UMB! Zen master! Next you\u0027ll trot out Cosmic Consciousness! Of all the impractical -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"John, we\u0027ve refined this question down to its essence,\" Timberlake said. \"If you\u0027d -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I asked you to give me some circuit suggestions. I\u0027ve been listening to you play verbal medicine ball for ten minutes, and what I want to know is this: How will all that yakking build one circuit? Just one circuit!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You yourself asked UMB to define consciousness,\" Prudence protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I wanted to keep them occupied and out of our hair.\" The screen went blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlattery looked over to the console in front of Prudence, saw that the command-circuit key pointed to \"on,\" but the screen remained blank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat key is on! Flattery told himself. It had to be turned on deliberately. She did it! To waken Bickel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut why was the screen blank?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs though she read his mind, Prudence said: \"John\u0027s installed an override on the command circuit. Any idea why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you see where he was?\" Timberlake demanded. \"He was in the shop - working on that Ox mess!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimberlake unlocked his action couch and, in almost the same motion, launched himself at the hatch to the computer maintenance shop. He wrenched at the lock dogs, but they remained immovable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s jammed the lock!\" Timberlake\u0027s voice rose in fear. \"If he wrecks our computer...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You noticed... so you may as well watch,\" taunted Bickel\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey looked up to see a view of the shop on their big screen. Bickel stood with the detritus of the initial Ox installation around him - dangling leads, meters, neuron blocks - all stacked precariously away from the computer wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bickel, listen to reason,\" Timberlake pleaded. \"You can\u0027t just tear into -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up or I\u0027ll turn you off,\" Bickel warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knelt with a substitute neuron block, inserted it between the Ox and the computer wall, began making connections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, John,\" Prudence begged, \"if you\u0027d -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not going to stop him by talking to him,\" Flattery said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to Raj.\" Bickel slipped another neuron block into place against the wall, made new connections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rhythm,\" he said. \"I went to sleep on it... and it woke me up - that and your yakking. Rhythm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother substitute neuron block went into place beneath the first two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Describe what you\u0027re doing,\" Flattery said, and he motioned for Timberlake to come to his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brain-vision anatomy can be reduced to the mathematical description of a scanning process,\" Bickel answered. \"It follows that any other brain-function anatomy - including consciousness - should submit to the same approach. I can duplicate the alpha-rhythm cycle for a brain-scanning sweep by setting it up in the time-cycle of these neuron blocks. If I trace each rhythm from a human model and duplicate -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the function of each of these human rhythms?\" Flattery demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he spoke, Flattery scribbled a note on a pad of ship flimsy, pressed it into Timberlake\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimberlake looked up to the screen, but Bickel still had his back to the video eyes that matched the screen-view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know that function for certain, do we?\" Flattery asked, and he motioned frantically for Timberlake to read the note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimberlake turned his attention onto the paper, read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"BACK WAY, AROUND THE HYB TANKS. BICKEL HASN\u0027T JAMMED THE HATCH FROM QUARTERS. TAKE THE OTHER TUBE AND SURPRISE HIM.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, Timberlake looked up to the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ox was taking on new shape under Bickers hands - reaching out to the angle of the shop against the computer wall. It began to assume a feeling of topological improbability in Timberlake\u0027s eyes - with jutting triangles of plastic, oblongs of neuron couplers, strips of Eng multipliers... and the color-coded leads interweaving like a crazy spiderweb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimberlake felt a hand grab his arm, shake him. He looked at the hand, followed its arm to Flattery\u0027s glaring face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlattery gestured to the note in Timberlake\u0027s other hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, Timberlake looked at the note, recognizing why he remained rooted to this spot. Around the hyb tanks?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would have to be through the hyb tanks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlattery must know that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimberlake turned his tortured gaze on Flattery, bringing the terror up to full awareness. Bickel has infected me with his cynical skepticism. I\u0027m afraid of what I\u0027ll find in the hyb tanks if I look too close. I\u0027ll find the tanks empty, and nothing but leads back into the computer from the tanks. And the computer will be programmed to simulate the presence of hybernating life in those tanks. The whole thing will turn out to be a monstrous hoax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll discover I\u0027ve been life-systems engineer to... nothing....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do Ifear that? he wondered. Even this thought set him shivering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, Flattery shook his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy doesn\u0027t he go? Timberlake wondered. He\u0027s so anxious!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer was obvious: Flattery wasn\u0027t as knowledgeable about computers. He couldn\u0027t analyze what Bickel was doing and repair - if that was possible - the damage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m panic-stricken, Timberlake thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he knew he couldn\u0027t stay rooted here. He had to take that other passage. And when he got into the hyb tanks, he wouldn\u0027t be able to resist the close inspection. He\u0027d look beyond the dials and gauges and repeaters. He\u0027d look into the tanks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite his unexplainable terror, the other possibility remained - that the tanks contained life, and this life shared their danger. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/destination-void-destination-void-1/page-19.html","bookId":2449,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:22:21 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:22:21 PM"}
