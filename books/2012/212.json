I – I need you to hate me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I know, husband.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShelemasa could see that beseeching need in Gall’s reddened eyes, but his wife gave him nothing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried again. ‘Wife, the Burned Tears died at the Charge.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanavat simply shook her head, then took Shelemasa’s hand and led her into the camp. It was time to leave. They had to see to the horses. Shelemasa spared one glance back and saw Gall standing alone, hands covering his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘In grief,’ murmured Hanavat, ‘people will do anything to escape what cannot be escaped. Shelemasa, you must go to Jastara. You must take back your words.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I will not.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It is not for you to judge – yet how often is it that those in no position to judge are the first to do so, and with such fire and venom? Speak to her, Shelemasa. Help her find some peace.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But how can I, when just to think of her fills me with disgust?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I did not suggest it would be easy, daughter.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I will give it some thought.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Very well. Just don’t wait too long.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe army lifted into motion like a beast mired in mud, one last exhausted heave forward, weight dragging it down. The wagons lurched behind the teams of haulers as they strapped on their harnesses and took up the ropes. Scores of tents were left standing, along with a scattering of cookpots and soiled clothing lying like trampled flags.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlies roiled in clouds to swarm the hunched-over, silent soldiers, and overhead the glow of the Jade Strangers was brighter than any moonlight, bright enough for Lostara Yil to see every detail on the painted shields of the regulars, which they now carried to keep the flies from their backs. The lurid green painted drawn, lined faces with a ghastly corpulent hue, and made unearthly the surrounding desert. Clouds of butterflies wheeled above like ever-building storms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLostara stood with Henar Vygulf at her side, watching the Adjunct draw on her cloak, watching her lifting the hood. She had taken to leading the vanguard herself, five or six paces ahead of everyone else, excepting Captain Fiddler’s thirty or so Khundryl youths who ranged ahead a hundred paces, scouts with nothing to scout. Lostara’s eyes stayed on the Adjunct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘In Bluerose,’ said Henar, ‘there is a festival of the Black-Winged Lord once every ten years on winter’s longest night. The High Priestess shrouds herself and leads a procession through the city.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘This Black-Winged Lord is your god?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Unofficially, under the suspicious regard of the Letherii. Highly proscribed, in fact, but this procession was one of the few that they did not outlaw.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You were celebrating the year’s longest night?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not really. Not in the fashion that farmers might each winter, to celebrate the coming of the planting season – very few farms around Bluerose; we were mostly seafaring. Well, maritime, anyway. It was meant to summon our god, I suppose. I was not much for making sense of such things. And as I said, it was once every ten years.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLostara waited. Henar wasn’t a talkative man – thank Hood – but when he spoke he always had something useful to say. Eventually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Hooded, she’d walk silent streets, followed by thousands equally mute, down to the water’s edge. She would stand just beyond the reach of the surf. An acolyte would come up to her carrying a lantern, which she would take in one hand. And at the moment of dawn’s first awakening, she would fling that lantern into the water, quenching its light.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLostara grunted. ‘Curious ritual. Instead of the lantern, then, the sun. Sounds like you were worshipping the coming of day more than anything else.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then she would draw a ceremonial dagger and cut her own throat.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaken, Lostara Yil faced him, but found she had nothing to say. No response seemed possible. Then a thought struck her. ‘And that was a festival the Letherii permitted?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They would come down and watch, picnicking on the strand.’ He shrugged. ‘For them it was one less irritating High Priestess, I suppose.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze returned to the Adjunct. She had just set out. A shrouded figure, hidden from all behind her by that plain hood. The soldiers fell in after her and the only sound that came from them was the dull clatter of their armour, the thump of their boots. Lostara Yil shivered and leaned close to Henar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The hood,’ Henar muttered. ‘It reminded me, that’s all.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-212.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
