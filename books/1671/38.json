He might end the war and save the world, and we’re trying to give him a hand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis satisfied her, enough to release her death grip on her grandson. “All right then. Mr. Troost, if you say they’re with you…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They are, so don’t fret—not even for a moment. I’m going to take these nice folks back to the quiet taps. We’ve got some talking to do.” He cast a sharp glance at the white man, who hadn’t been identified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go on back,” he said. “I’ll stick it out up here and see if the ship shows up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good deal. Come on, you two, this way,” Troost said to Maria and Henry. He led them back through the underground apartment with its hard wood chairs and two low beds, and out a door at the back end. As he went, he explained, “We have a telegraph line here. Runs underground, like the railroad, and it works just fine, so long as nobody messes with it. Not a whole lot of people know its signal, so don’t go running off at the mouth. I probably don’t have to warn you about such things, but don’t take it personal. Caution is the grease that keeps this railroad running smooth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand,” Maria said quietly, following him along a corridor and past a couple of doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe you do, and maybe you don’t. If anybody gets a whiff of what goes on out here, dozens of people will get shot before word even makes it to the city. This whole block is floating on high treason, and everyone who knows about it is a suspect.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I really do understand. Believe me, I was a spy for years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For this side, yes. You only know what the Grays will do to protect a body. You don’t know what they’ll do to destroy one. In here.” He opened a door and guided them through. “I don’t mean any disrespect, ma’am, but I’m thanking Christ Almighty that no one recognized you back there. Having you set foot in this place is sacrilege, so far as they would figure it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cut her off. “You want to tell me what you really think? How you really feel about slavery? Save your breath. If you want to help, and you don’t want to make any trouble for these people, then you’ll keep your past and everything else to yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped and faced her. Maria didn’t flinch, but she didn’t press forward, either, even though she had the extra height on him and—if she was honest with herself—a few pounds on him, to boot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said to her, a little more gently, “Your silence is the only thing that can prove you here. Hold your tongue, hide your name, and don’t tell a soul about where you came from, or what brought you—unless you tell ’em it’s the Pinks, because that’s what I said already. Anything more than that and you start a panic and put us all in danger. You got it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I … I got it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, here are the … facilities,” he said, picking a word for the rigged-up taps system that filled the bulk of the room. Wires ran to and fro, and tap receivers were set up across a table, some of them quivering with a signal freshly sent or received. No one monitored them at the moment, though the white man from the living area showed up shortly to poke his head in the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Holler if anything starts signaling through if it’s longer than you want to read.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will do,” Troost said, then returned his attention to his guests. “I can take the script, but I’m slower than he is.” He cocked a thumb toward the door. “And, anyway, right now I’ve got other things to attend to. Most recent word from D.C. says we’ve got worse problems than we knew. How much have you heard?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry said, “Maynard is apparently on the move. Could kill hundreds of thousands before it’s finished. And it’s pointed at civilian targets, not military ones, except maybe Danville.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not headed for Danville,” Troost said firmly. “Not enough of a population center. It would be more convenient to send it to a bigger city.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Atlanta?” Maria guessed. It was the biggest city of all, outside New York.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s the word on the wires. At present, it ought to be someplace south of Dalton, but north of Marietta. That’s as close as anyone could pin it down. The taps are having trouble between here and there, but I don’t know if it’s a conspiracy, or just an inconvenience. You can rest assured I’ll keep trying to rouse the Rebs, though. They’ll sure as shit want to know about it, and might even be able to help. You never know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anything’s possible. And now Maynard is somewhere within…” Maria wracked her brain, trying to make an educated assessment. “Seventy or eighty miles of here? That’s no pinpoint, but it’s a narrower window than we had before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When we’re finished up here and you’re on your way, I’ll drop Mr. Lincoln a line to keep him informed.” Some flicker of uncertainty crossed Troost’s face, but quickly passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Maria saw it, and she asked, “What? Is something wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroost laughed, short and harsh. “Other than the end of the world, you mean?” He pulled a map out of a drawer beneath the taps and spread it out beside them. “I can’t be sure, but I think something funny’s up in the District. I don’t trust the wires there, not tonight. There’s an interruption someplace, and I don’t like it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry stiffened, and he narrowed his eyes. “You think Mr. Lincoln’s in danger?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think everyone’s in danger, more often than not. But yes, him in particular. And maybe the president, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think it’ll go that far?” Maria asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s gone farther than him already. But there’s nothing I can do about that right now. Not from here.” Finished with the subject for the time being, he jabbed his finger at the map to guide them, and said, “All right. From where we’re sitting now, the fastest way to Georgia is that road right outside, the little highway you came in on. But the more direct route is this road, which cuts through the south end of town and out past the ridge. The main road drops down that way, and it’s a straight shot to Atlanta, then on to Macon, and so forth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can we take that map?” Henry asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroost rolled it up. “It’s all yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But will they be sticking to the main roads?” Maria asked. “They’re on a covert military mission; wouldn’t they take the side streets and back ways? They’re less likely to be caught that way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know what side streets you’re talking about. Most of the way, it’s the main road or nothing. And these men don’t have much choice but to hide in plain sight. We’re talking about two dozen soldiers, a half-dozen horses, and a couple of carts big enough to pass for a mobile hydrogen station. They’ll be dressed in grays, with paperwork that’ll fool anyone who’d stop them—especially since there’s a big hydro facility in the middle of Atlanta. That may even be the truth, as that’s probably where they intend to detonate the weapon. It’s right at the edge of a real dense neighborhood, with plenty of easy victims.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And if the cloud roams…?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can’t tell you much about the weather, ma’am,” Troost replied. “All I know is that word out of the city says it’s fair and calm, but clouds are coming up from the southwest, so you never know. Might be a storm in the Gulf pushing up a breeze. Let’s hope not, eh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe murmured, “You hope. I’ll pray.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pray into one hand, shit in the other. You tell me which one fills up first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s unnecessary.” She frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a reminder, that’s all. Get out there and do your jobs, and don’t count on any help from above, unless it comes in the form of an airship.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry stuck the map into his coat, jamming it down into a pocket. “And it’s our job to stop this caravan? The pair of us? Against a contingent of special Union forces?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A Pink and a Marshal against a squadron?” Troost grinned, and it only looked a little forced. “I almost feel bad for them. Now, let’s get you on the move so that I can get on the move.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria asked, “You’re taking Sally and Caleb out? Tonight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, ma’am, I’m getting them as far from the blast zone as I can. Orders right from the top, from Uncle Grant this time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry said, “I was under the impression he hadn’t been too helpful so far.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroost started to roam the room, packing up small items and throwing them into a satchel. “He’s a sad old drunk who’s sitting in a nest of vipers, but he’s not a bad sort—and I don’t know what convinced him, but I can make a guess or two. Uncle Abe implied that Miss Haymes showed up to give him a heart-to-heart in person. But you know how it is with telegrams. You have to guess at half the detail.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaria tapped her fingernail on the table beside the telegraph key. “So, Henry, how fast can that carriage of yours run? It seemed a bit slow-going on the way here—not that I’m complaining, of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroost announced, “I have a better idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry grinned. “I told her you might,” he said, as Troost passed him a small packet of paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take this down to the dirigible docks on Missionary Ridge. Henry, you know the place?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can find it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Got you a two-seater reserved. It’ll be cold flying—and I expect that might be hard on a delicate magnolia like yourself, Miss Boyd, but—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hush your ridiculous mouth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“—but if you’re living on the Chicago lake, I figure you’ll survive the discomfort. Now, the craft’s reserved under the name Henry Fisher, courtesy of the Texas Rangers. I ran it that way because your stars ain’t too different, and if I’d put it under the Marshals, they’d have put me under arrest. Sorry, but you’ll have to fib it as a brown. How’s your Republican accent?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fiddlehead-the-clockwork-century-5/page-38.html","bookId":1671,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:33 PM"}
