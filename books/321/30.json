The two young men on the craft were skillful sailors, and soon came within reach of Nelson. One held out a boathook, and presently our hero was hauled on board.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s a lucky thing we were near by, or you[Pg 225] might have been drowned,\" said the young man called Bob. \"Isn\u0027t that so, Clarence?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s true,\" answered Clarence Bell. \"I see your ship isn\u0027t stopping for you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"She isn\u0027t my ship, and I don\u0027t want her to stop,\" answered Nelson, shaking the water from him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh!

As soon as he had donned the other suit he[Pg 226] sat down and told how he had chased Billy Darnley on board the Victory, and of what had followed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Humph! that captain is pretty hard-hearted,\" remarked Clarence Bell.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He ought to be arrested,\" put in Bob Chalmer. \"You were lucky to get away.

They had had good luck, as the mess on board proved, and they were now sailing for Manasquan Inlet, where they were boarding for a few weeks.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We belong in New York,\" said Bob Chalmer later. \"And I guess we can see you through all right.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll be much obliged, if you would,\" said Nelson. \"I\u0027ll pay you back as soon as I reach the city.\" And then he told of the news stand, and the business he and Van Pelt were doing.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The breeze was as brisk as ever, and it veered around, so that the sloop made the Inlet [Pg 227]without difficulty. They ran up the river to a small collection of cottages and boathouses known as Reefer\u0027s. Here they tied up, and Nelson went ashore, wearing the old fishing suit he had borrowed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You can\u0027t get home to-night, so you shall stay with us,\" said Bob Chalmer, and procured a room at one of the cottages for Nelson. Tired out, our hero slept well. But he arose early, and by that time his own clothes were dry, and he put them on.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ve got a railroad ticket in my pocket good from Lakewood to New York,\" said Chalmer, while they were having breakfast. \"It\u0027s a limited ticket and runs out to-morrow.

Yet[Pg 228] Nelson thought but little of the journey. His mind was filled with his personal affairs. He wondered what Van Pelt thought of his continued disappearance.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He\u0027ll think I\u0027ve captured Darnley sure,\" he reasoned. \"Well, what\u0027s happened can\u0027t be helped, and I\u0027m lucky to escape, I suppose.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On and on went the stage, making good time, for the team was fresh.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When about two miles from Lakewood they reached a bend, where the road was being repaired.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A steam roller was at work, and at this one of the horses grew frightened and started to run away. His mate went with him, and in a twinkle the stage was bumping along at a high rate of speed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Stop! stop!\" shrieked a lady sitting near Nelson. \"Stop, or we\u0027ll all be killed!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Whoa! whoa!\" roared the stage-driver, and tried to pull the horses in. But his lines were old, and suddenly one snapped, and then the horses went along faster than ever.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Not far down the road were several heaps of stone, to be used in repairing the highway, and the team headed directly for the first of these heaps. The driver tried to sheer them around, but with one line gone was nearly helpless, and[Pg 229] in a second more the stage struck the pile and went over with a crash. Then the horses came to a halt.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n No one was seriously injured by the mishap, although the lady who had cried out was much shaken up.
