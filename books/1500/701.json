The true power of the energy pillar was less than a hundredth of the power she felt from the energy gathering. This was Pandora’s final trick to deceive the enemy, her dying counterattack and fleeing method. However, despite this being the case, if the energy light beam struck her head on, Madeline would be heavily injured even if she didn’t die, the areas that were struck even more so vaporized under the ridiculously high temperature. She didn’t even know if the important parts that were lost because of this, for example, her arms or legs, had a chance of regenerating. Meanwhile, Pandora was already high in the air.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMadeline definitely didn’t believe she didn’t even have this bit of precision.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePersephone released a groan, struggling as she climbed to her feet. Madeline left behind a hidden blow when throwing her out, long calculated that she would jump out, only leaving her with enough strength to jump to Madeline, yet unable to touch her, a position that offered the greatest area of protection.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePersephone felt a slight numb sensation from all of her bones, a great feeling of limp and painful powerlessness. All of her muscles were shaking uncontrollably, making it hard for her to even raise a hand. Persephone couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed with shock; she understood Madeline’s combat strength well, but she never expected that it had already reached this degree. At that time, Madeline only lightly tapped her body, yet it was already enough to make all of her bones shake, immediately breaking down her ability to move.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePandora already left. Cirvanas was still laying on the ground, not moving at all, as if unknown whether or not he was still alive or dead. However, his back that was trembling uncontrollably sold him out.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Cirvanas…” Madeline calmly spoke, immediately making him jump up from the ground, standing perfectly straight.

The mountaintop that had just experienced a great battle became even more rugged, the warped heavy club also looking especially sinister. Meanwhile, under this type of environment, under the contrast of night, Madeline’s silhouette shed its valiant and ferocious exterior, revealing her soft side.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePersephone walked over, standing by Madeline’s side.

At that time, I was always scared, and I didn’t know what I was scared of, which was why I frantically trained everything the empress taught me. During that entire year, only when she praised me would I feel a bit of security. In addition, the castle was extremely cold, my hands forever cold.

I spoke about many, many things related to him, and I even drew pictures for you, within them what I had imagined he would now look like.
