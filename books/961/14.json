{"id":17035,"no":14,"title":"Chapter 13","content":"\u0026nbsp;The restaurant was small and quiet. Corinna and Kintyre had a corner table, where the light fell gently. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"By rights we should have a Genever apéritif,\" he said, \"but I\u0027m convinced Dutch gin is distilled from frogs. On the other hand, Dutch beer compares to Hof, Rothausbr?u, or Kronenbourg.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You\u0027ve traveled a lot, haven\u0027t you?\" she said. \"I envy you that. Never got farther than the Sierras myself.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A little embarrassed—he had not been trying to play the cosmopolite—he fell silent while she glanced at her menu. \"Will you order for me?\" she asked finally. \"You know your way around these dishes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He made his selections, pleased by the compliment. When the beer came, in conical half-liter glasses, he raised his: \"Prosit.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Salute.\" She drank slowly. \"Wonderful. But this may not be wise on top of two whiskies.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It\u0027s all right if you go easy. Take the word of a hardened bowser.\" He searched out an inward weariness on the strong broad face. \"You could use a little anesthesia.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well—\" She set her glass down. \"Bear with me. I promise not to blubber, but I may get sentimental. Or maybe even hilarious, I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve never lost anyone close to me before now.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I understand,\" said Kintyre.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And please help me steer clear of myself,\" she added. \"I would like to talk about Bruce, and otherwise about wholly neutral things.\" She managed a smile. \"I\u0027ve been meaning to ask you something. You\u0027re the Machiavelli specialist. Our theater did Mandragola last year. Tell me, how could the same man write that and Il Principe?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Actually,\" said Kintyre, \"I would be surprised if the author of The Prince—or, rather, the Discourses on Livy, since The Prince is really just a pamphlet—I\u0027d be surprised if he had not done sheer amusement equally well. One of the more damnable heresies of this era is its notion that a man can only be good at one thing. That versatility is not the inborn human norm.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ve often thought the same,\" she said. \"I suppose you know Bruce changed his major to history because of you. He took one of your classes as a freshman. Now I see why.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well,\" he stalled, and hoisted his beer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She shifted the conversation with a tact he appreciated: \"But how did you happen to get interested in it, in the Italian Renaissance yet, with a name like yours?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I served time in one of those private schools back East,\" he said. \"The Romance languages master got me enthusiastic.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He paused, then continued slowly: \"I entered Harvard, but Pearl Harbor happened in my sophomore year. I was in the Navy the whole war, the Pacific; fell in love with the Bay Area on my shore leaves, which is why I came here to live afterward. But during the war I had a lot of time to read and try to think where this world was going. To the wolves, I decided—like Machiavelli\u0027s world—I suppose that\u0027s why I feel so close to him. He was also studying the problem of how the decent man can survive. He spoke the truth as he saw it, because he didn\u0027t think that civilization should be encumbered with nice-nellyisms that the barbarians had already discarded. Wherefore he became the original Old Nick, and the very people—us, the free people, whom he could warn—won\u0027t listen, because we think he speaks for the enemy!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He braked. \"Sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to orate at you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wish more men had convictions,\" she said. \"Even when I don\u0027t agree. Everybody respects everybody else\u0027s sensibilities so much these days, there\u0027s nothing left to talk about but football scores.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You\u0027re very kind,\" he said. \"Ah, here come the appetizers. Pay special attention to the characteristically Dutch delicacy, Russian eggs, but don\u0027t ask me how they came by that name.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Later, after much talk, some of it with enough laughter to tell him she was a merry soul in better days:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A ruby spark lay in their glasses of Cherry Heering. \"This isn\u0027t Dutch either,\" said Kintyre. \"However.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you know,\" she said, \"I begin to understand the old idea of a wake. Getting the clan together and having one fine brawling celebration. It\u0027s more an act of love, really, than drawing the parlor curtains and talking in hushed voices.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s the Latin who speaks,\" he said. \"We Protestant races are cursed with the tradition that misery is a virtue.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But you, you Bostonian Scot or whatever you are—I hear a trace of accent—you approve.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I left Boston for the Pacific at the arthritic age of nine.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What was the reason for that?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My father was a marine architect. He was laid off in, uh, 1930. Being an imaginative man, he spent his savings on a schooner, hired a Mexican crew, and we all lit out for the South Seas. For seven years we lived on that schooner.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Bruce told me you were a sailor.\" Her eyes were very bright upon him. \"But how did you make it pay?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Miscellaneously. Sometimes we carried cargo and passengers between islands. The passengers were usually Kanakas, and those who didn\u0027t have money would pay us in food and hospitality when we got where we were going. Father wasn\u0027t after riches anyway. His main enterprise was to gather and prepare marine specimens, for museums and colleges and so on. Toward the end, he was making a name for himself. Well, we never saw much cash money, but we never needed a lot either.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Kintyre held his glass to the light, tossed it off and followed it with a scalding sip of coffee. Why was he speaking of this? He had barely mentioned his youth to anyone else, except Trig, who was the friend of a dozen years. Trig had led him into the dojo, hoping that its discipline of mind as well as body would strangle the horror. But Corinna had the story out of him in a matter of hours, not even knowing what she did.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He had taken her for Morna last night.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What happened?\" she asked. Her tone said that he needn\u0027t answer unless he wanted to.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A typhoon and a lee shore,\" he said. \"I was the only survivor.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He took out a cigarette. She folded her hands and waited, in case he should want to say more.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That was in the Gilbert Islands,\" he continued after the smoke was curling down his tongue. \"The British authorities shipped me home. The guardianship was wished onto a cousin of my mother\u0027s. So I went to the boarding school I spoke of, and summers I worked at a seaside resort. Don\u0027t feel sorry for me, it was quite a good life.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But a lonely one,\" she said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He grinned with a single corner of his mouth. \"\u0027He travels the fastest who travels alone.\u0027\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I understand a great deal now.\" She held her cup so lightly that he grew aware he was in danger of breaking his. Tendon by tendon, he eased his fingers. \"Yes,\" she said after a moment. \"Bruce was always puzzled by you. As I imagine most people are. You don\u0027t seem to belong anywhere, to anything or anyone. And yet you do. You belong to a world that foundered in the ocean.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It jarred him. Not given to self-analysis, he had imagined he lived a logical, well adapted round of days.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Sometime you\u0027ll build it again,\" she said. \"Oh, not the physical ship, you\u0027ve more important things on hand, but a personal world.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And again it was a blow, to be shown himself as alien as a castaway from Mars.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Please,\" he said, more roughly than he had intended. \"I don\u0027t find my personality the most interesting object on earth.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She nodded, as if to herself. The long hair swept her flat high-boned cheeks. \"Of course. You wouldn\u0027t.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Perhaps I\u0027d better take you home now,\" he said, without noticeable enthusiasm. \"Are you working tomorrow?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Only if I feel like it, my boss told me. I\u0027d planned to, but—Are you in any hurry?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Contrariwise.\" I don\u0027t think I would sleep much.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then could we go somewhere and talk? I\u0027d like to ask you some things.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027d love to be asked. I know a place.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was small, dark, and masculine, undegraded by jukebox or television. Kintyre led Corinna into a booth at the rear.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"They serve steam beer,\" he said. \"The only really good beer made in this country.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oof! I couldn\u0027t. Another Irish, if I may. I promise to go slow.\" Her tone was not as light as the words.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nonetheless, he needed a little while to sense the trouble in her.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n After much time she met his eyes, obviously forcing his own. \"Dr. Kintyre,\" she began.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was about to ask her to use his given name; and then he thought how little intimacy could be achieved in this American cult of first-name familiarity with all the universe. \"Yes?\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I would—I would have thanked you for a wonderful time, which helped me more than you know. And then I would have gone home. But—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He waited.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know how to say it,\" she stumbled. \"I knew you were Bruce\u0027s—Bruce\u0027s brother, the one he should have had. But only tonight could I feel it.\" She searched for a phrase. Finally: \"I don\u0027t believe I could hurt myself by being serious with you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hope not,\" he said, as grave as she. \"I can\u0027t promise it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why did you go to the Michaelises last night?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027m not quite sure.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You want to discover who killed Bruce? Isn\u0027t that it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am not a self-appointed detective. The police can do that job infinitely better than I. But I have been thinking.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What do you think?\" she persisted.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I certainly wouldn\u0027t go accusing someone who—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Can you realize what Brace meant to me?\" She asked it quietly, as a meaningful request for truth. \"We were more than siblings. We were friends, all our lives, in a way they haven\u0027t made words for.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I do know,\" he said, and he would have told it to few other creatures that lived. \"I had a younger sister myself.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Even after he left home—can you imagine the way he continued to watch over me? How often he stepped in and used a word or two to straighten out a lonesome, confused, unhappy girl whom nobody else liked; how he steered me toward the kind of people I can feel at home with; how he healed the breach with my parents, when I had to get away and they didn\u0027t understand; how he got me out of a wretched business office and into the museum, where I can like what I\u0027m doing and believe it has some value. You knew Bruce, did you know that side of him?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No,\" said Kintyre. \"He wouldn\u0027t have talked about it. Still, yes, I can imagine.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And he was lured somewhere, and tortured, and murdered,\" she said. The lacquered fingernails stood white where she caught the table edge.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Kintyre didn\u0027t touch her himself, but he held out his hand. She gripped it for a while. Her face was lowered. When she let go and looked up again, he saw tears.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she gulped. \"I promised not to bawl, and then—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Kintyre let her have it out. It didn\u0027t take long, nor was it noisy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She said at last, in a wire-thin voice: \"Why was it done? Who would do it, to him of all people in the world?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Kintyre. \"I just don\u0027t know.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But you can guess, can\u0027t you? You know everyone concerned. That writer he was having the fight with. That businessman who owns the thesis manuscript. Gene Michaelis. You could be wrong! Even his girl, God help me for saying it. Who?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why must you know?\" he asked.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why?\" It took her aback. \"To know! To understand—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you want to be reassured the murderer won\u0027t strike at you next? I hardly think you need fear that.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of course not!\" she flared. \"I want to know so the world can make some sense again.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s too metaphysical to be true,\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Briefly, she shivered with tension. Then, leaning back, she picked up her whisky glass and sipped of it and asked coldly:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Where did you go last night after you left the Michaelis place?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Home,\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Guido was badly shaken today. He hadn\u0027t slept at all, I could see that in the morning. He stayed around the apartment like a hurt animal. I know him, he\u0027s terrified.\" Corinna spat as if at an enemy: \"What did you do to him?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Nothing!\" said Kintyre.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Her lip caught her teeth.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I didn\u0027t think of it till just now,\" she breathed. \"But it all fits. You do know something. In God\u0027s name, tell me!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He said, with an overpowering compassion: \"I see. You\u0027re afraid Guido is involved.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes,\" she said dully.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why should he be?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh—I don\u0027t know—jealousy? Who can tell? Guido always seemed like the wild, reckless one and Bruce a mama\u0027s boy. Yet it was Bruce who left home and Guido never has.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Let\u0027s have no half-digested psychological theory,\" he said, purposely astringent. \"Stick to facts. What leads you to suspect your brother is involved?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I might as well tell you,\" she sighed. \"Last week he was dropping all kinds of dark hints about a big job which would take him out of town over the weekend. He\u0027s like that, has to sound important, mostly there\u0027s no harm in it. But he came back Monday evening with a good deal of money. I knew he was broke before. He had even been forced to sell his car. He came in loaded with expensive presents for all of us, and had a fat roll in his wallet. Of course, when we told him about Bruce, that more or less made us forget it. But then today, how frightened he was—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What happened last night?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Kintyre took out a cigarette. \"Excuse me while I think,\" he said. He made a ceremony of lighting it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Guido is in trouble,\" he admitted. \"I don\u0027t know how closely related to the murder it is.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t misunderstand me.\" Her face could have been modeled in chalk. \"I never thought Guido would—would dream of—no! But he could have been drawn into something. And what would the police think?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Uh-huh. The same notion occurred to me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What happened, then?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He told her.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, no.\" Her eyes closed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You see my dilemma,\" he said wearily. \"I\u0027ll protect Guido if my conscience will let me, even though it\u0027s already led me into lawbreaking. But I don\u0027t know, I can\u0027t tell—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She opened her eyes again. They blazed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thank You,\" she said, not to Kintyre.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n His scalp crawled. \"What are you thinking of?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I know Guido,\" she answered. \"I can get the truth out of him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You can try.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She stood up. \"I\u0027ll take a cab,\" she said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What?\" He rose himself. \"You\u0027re not going there now?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"When else? I\u0027m sorry, it\u0027s a shabby way to treat you, but do you think something like this can wait?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A murderer is hanging around that place,\" he said. \"You can see Guido tomorrow at your parents\u0027, but tonight I won\u0027t have it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She grinned. There was even a little humor in the expression. \"What do you plan to do?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Call the police!\" he rapped.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She said like a sword: \"By the time you\u0027ve explained all the ins and outs to them, I\u0027ll have taken him elsewhere.
