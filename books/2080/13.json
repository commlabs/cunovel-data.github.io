Some kind of hypnosis, she supposed. But she\u0027d had enough of hypnosis in the last\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eweek. She fought it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she fought with her body, unskillfully maybe, but with utter conviction. She head-butted him on the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enose when he tried to get close to her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ow!\" The Artful Dodger jerked back. Then he got a better grip on her arm. He pulled the wrist toward\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehim and Hannah suddenly realized what he was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edoing. There were nice accessible veins there. He was going to draw blood from her wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you don\u0027t,\" she gasped. She had no idea what would happen if she lost any more blood to a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evampire. Thierry had said she wasn\u0027t in danger as long as she kept away from them for the next week, so\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe presumed that if she didn\u0027t stay away, she was in danger. And she was already noticing little changes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein herself: her ability to see better in the dark, for instance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to wrench her arm out of the boy\u0027s grip- and then she heard a gasp. Suddenly she realized that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe wasn\u0027t holding her as tightly, and he wasn\u0027t trying to pull her wrist to him. Instead he was just staring at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt her ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe expression on his face might have been funny if Hannah hadn\u0027t been shaking with adrenaline. He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elooked shocked, dismayed, scared, disbelieving, and embarrassed all at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who-who-who are you?\" he spluttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah looked at the ring, and then at him. Of course. How could she have been so stupid? She should\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave mentioned Thierry right away. If he was a Lord of the Night World, maybe everybody knew him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe she could skip the witches altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you I was looking for somebody. His name is Thierry Descouedres. He gave me this ring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Artful Dodger gave a kind of moan. Then he looked up at her from under his spiky bangs. \"I didn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehurt you, did I?\" he said. It wasn\u0027t a question, it was a demand for agreement. \"I didn\u0027t do anything to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t get the chance,\" Hannah said. But she was afraid the boy might just take off running, so she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eadded, \"I don\u0027t want to get you in trouble. I just want to find Thierry. Can you help me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ... help you. Yeah, yeah. I can be a big help.-\" He hesitated, then said, \"It\u0027s kind of a long walk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA walk? Thierry was here? Hannah\u0027s heart leaped so high that her whole body felt light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not tired,\" she said, and it was true. \"I can walk anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house was enormous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagnificent. Palatial, even. Awe-inspiring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Artful Dodger abandoned Hannah at the beginning of the long palm-tree-lined drive, blurting, \"That\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eit,\" and then scampering off into the darkness. Hannah looked after him for a moment, then grimly started\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eup the drive, sincerely hoping that it was it. She was so tired that she was weaving and her feet felt as if\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey\u0027d been pounded with stones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she walked up to the front door, though, her doubts disappeared. There were black roses\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeverywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an arch-shaped stained-glass window above the double doors, showing a black rose that had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe same intricately knotted stem as the one on Hannah\u0027s ring. The same design had been worked into the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecrowns over the windows. It was used like a family crest or seal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust seeing all those roses made Hannah\u0027s heart beat faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, then. Ring the doorbell, she told herself. And stop feeling like some Cinderella who\u0027s come to see\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhat\u0027s keeping the prince.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed the doorbell button, then held her breath as chimes echoed distantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease. Please answer....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard footsteps approaching and her heart really started to pound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t believe it\u0027s all been this easy....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when the door opened, it wasn\u0027t Thierry. It was a college-age guy with a suit, brown hair pulled\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eback into a short ponytail, and dark glasses. He looked vaguely like a young CIA agent, Hannah thought\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and Hannah stared at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, I\u0027m here to ... I\u0027m looking for Thierry Des-couedres,\" Hannah said finally, trying to sound confident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe CIA guy didn\u0027t change expression. When he spoke, it wasn\u0027t unkindly, but Hannah\u0027s heart\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eplummeted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not here. Try again in a few days. And it\u0027s better to call one of his secretaries before showing up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to shut the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wave of desperation broke over Hannah. \"Wait!\" she said, and she actually stuck her foot in the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edoorway. She was amazed at herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe CIA guy looked down at her foot, then up at her face. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, God, he thinks I\u0027m a nuisance visitor. Hannah suddenly had a vision of swarms of petitioners lined\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eup at Thierry\u0027s house, all wanting him to do something for them. Like supplicants waiting for an audience\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith the king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I must look like riffraff, she thought. She was wearing Levis and a shirt that was sweaty and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewrinkled after tramping around the Strip all day. Her boots were dusty. Her hair was limp and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edisheveled, straggling over her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" the CIA guy said again, politely urgent. .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ... nothing.\" Hannah felt tears spring to her eyes and was furious with herself. She hid them by bending\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edown to pick up her duffel bag, which by now felt as if it were loaded with rocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had never been so tired. Her mouth was dry and cottony and her muscles were starting to cramp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had no idea where to find a safe place to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn\u0027t the CIA guy\u0027s problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Hannah said. She took a deep breath and started to turn away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the deep breath that did it. Someone was crossing the grand entrance hall behind the CIA guy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand the breath delayed Hannah long enough that they saw each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nilsson, wait!\" the someone yelled and came bounding over to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a girl, thin and tanned, with odd silvery-brown hair and dark amber eyes. She had several\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyellowing bruises on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was her expression that startled Hannah. Her amber eyes were wide and sparkling in what looked\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elike recognition, her mouth was open in astonishment and excitement. She was waving her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s her!\" she yelled at the CIA guy, pointing to Hannah. \"It\u0027s her! It\u0027s her.\" When he stared at her,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe hit him in the shoulder. \"Her!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both turned to stare at Hannah. The CIA guy had an expression now. He looked stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah stared back at them, bewildered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, seeming dazed, the CIA guy very slowly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eopened the door. \"My name is Nilsson, miss,\" he said. \"Please come inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStupid me, Hannah thought. Almost as an afterthought, she pushed straggling hair off her left cheek,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eaway from her birthmark. I should have told them who I was. But how could I know they would\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunderstand?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNilsson was talking again as he gently took her bag. \"I\u0027m very sorry, miss-I didn\u0027t realize ... I hope you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewon\u0027t hold this-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody knew you were coming,\" the girl broke in with refreshing bluntness. \"And the worst thing is that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry\u0027s gone off somewhere. I don\u0027t think anybody knows where or when he\u0027ll be back. But meanwhile\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou\u0027d better stay put. I don\u0027t want to think about what he\u0027d do to us if we lost you.\" She smiled at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah and added, \"I\u0027m Lupe Acevedo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hannah Snow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" The girl winked. \"We met before, but I couldn\u0027t exactly introduce myself. Don\u0027t you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eremember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah started to shake her head-and then she blinked. Blinked again. That silvery-brown coloring...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethose amber eyes...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Lupe said, looking hugely delighted. \"That was me. That\u0027s how I got these bruises. The other\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewolf got it worse, though. I ripped him a new-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like something to drink?\" Nilsson interrupted hastily. \"Or to eat? Why don\u0027t you come in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand sit down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah\u0027s mind was reeling. That girl is a werewolf, she thought. A werewolf. The last time I saw her she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad big ears and a bushy tail. Werewolves are real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this one protected me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said dizzily, \"I ... thank you. I mean, you saved my life, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupe shrugged. \"Part of the job. Want a Coke?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah blinked, then laughed. \"I\u0027d kill for one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take care of it,\" Nilsson said. \"I\u0027ll take care of everything. Lupe, why don\u0027t you show her upstairs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hurried off and opened a cellular phone. A moment later several other guys dressed like him came\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erunning. The strange thing was that they were all very young-all in their late teens. Hannah caught\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esnatches of frantic-sounding conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, try that number-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about leaving a message with-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" Lupe said, interrupting Hannah\u0027s eavesdropping. With that same cheerful bluntness she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eadded, \"You look like you could use a bath.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe led Hannah past a giant white sculpture toward a wide curving staircase. Hannah glimpsed other\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erooms opening off the hallway. A living room that looked as big as a football field, decorated with white\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecouches, geometric furniture, and abstract paintings. A dining room with a mile-long table. An alcove with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea grand piano.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah felt more like Cinderella than ever. Nobody in Medicine Rock had a grand piano.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know he was so rich. I don\u0027t know if I can deal with this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when she was installed in a sort of Moorish fantasy bathroom, surrounded by jungly green plants\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand exotic tiles and brass globe lights with cut-out star shapes, she decided that she could probably\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eadjust to living this way. If forced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was heaven just to relax in the Jacuzzi tub, drinking a Coke and breathing in the delicious scent\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof bath salts. And it was even better to sit up in bed afterward, eating finger sandwiches sent up by\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chef\" and telling Lupe how she came to be in Las Vegas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she was done, Lupe said, \"Nilsson and everybody are trying to find Thierry. It may take a little\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhile, though. See, he just stopped off for a few minutes on Saturday, and then he disappeared again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut meanwhile, this house is pretty well protected. And all of us will fight for you-I mean, fight to the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edeath, if we have to. So it\u0027s safer than most other places.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah felt a roiling in her stomach. She didn\u0027t understand. Lupe made it sound as if they were in some\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecastle getting ready for a siege. \"Safe from... ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupe looked surprised. \"From her-Maya,\" she said, as if it should be obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah had a sinking feeling. I should have known, she thought. But all she said was, \"So you think I\u0027m\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estill in danger from her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupe\u0027s eyebrows shot up. She said mildly, \"Well, sure. She\u0027s going to try to kill you. And she\u0027s awfully\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egood at killing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEspecially me, Hannah thought. But she was too tired to be much afraid. Trusting to Lupe and Nilsson\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand the rest of Thierry\u0027s household, she fell asleep \"that night as soon as her head touched the pillow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe woke up to see sunshine. It was reflecting off the bedroom walls, which were painted a softly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eburnished gold. Weird but beautiful, Hannah thought, looking dreamily around at ebony furniture and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edecorative tribal masks. Then she remembered where she was and jumped out of bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found clean clothes-her size-lying on an elaborately carved chest. She had just finished pulling them\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon when Lupe knocked on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lupe, have they-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupe shook her silvery-brown head. \"They haven\u0027t found him yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah sighed, then smiled, trying not to look too disappointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupe made a sympathetic face. \"I know. While you wait, though, you might like to meet some people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned. \"They\u0027re sort of special people, and it\u0027s a secret that they\u0027re even here. But I talked to them\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elast night, and they all decided that it would be okay. They all want to meet you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah was curious. \"Special people? Are they humans or... uh... ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupe grinned even more widely. \"They\u0027re both. That\u0027s why they\u0027re special.\" As she talked, she was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eleading Hannah downstairs and through miles of hallway. \"They did something for me,\" she said, not\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esmiling now, but serious. \"They saved my life and my mom\u0027s life. See, I\u0027m not a purebred werewolf. My\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edad was human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah looked at her, startled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. And that\u0027s against the laws of the Night World. You can\u0027t fall in love with a human, much less\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emarry them. The other werewolves came one night and killed my dad. They would have killed my mom\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand me, too, but Thierry got us out of the city and hid us. That\u0027s why I\u0027d do anything for him. I wouldn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebe alive if it wasn\u0027t for him... and Circle Daybreak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had paused by the door of a room located toward the back of the house. Now, she opened the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edoor, gave Hannah a funny little nod and a wink, and said, \"You go meet them. I think you\u0027ll like each\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eother. You\u0027re their type.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah wasn\u0027t sure what this meant. She felt shy as she stepped over the threshold and looked around\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a den, smaller than the front living room, and more cozy, with furniture in warm ochers and burnt\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esiennas. A breakfast buffet was set out on a long sideboard made of golden pine. It smelled good, but\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah didn\u0027t have time to look at it. As soon as she came in the room, every head turned and she found\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea dozen people staring at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYoung people. All around her age. Normal-type teenagers, except that a surprising number of them\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere extremely good-looking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind her, the door closed firmly. Hannah felt more and more as if she\u0027d just walked out on stage and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eforgotten her lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen one of the girls sitting on an ottoman jumped up and ran to her. \"You\u0027re Hana, aren\u0027t you?\" she said\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewarmly. \"Hannah. Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m really meeting you! This is so exciting. Thierry\u0027s told us all about you.\" She put a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egentle hand on Hannah\u0027s arm. \"Hannah, this is Circle Daybreak. And my name is Thea Harman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was almost as tall as Hannah was, and the yellow hair spilling over her shoulders was a few shades\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edarker than Hannah\u0027s. Her eyes were brown\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand soft and somehow wise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Thea.\" Somehow Hannah felt instinctively at ease with this girl. \"Lupe was telling me about Circle\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaybreak, but I didn\u0027t exactly understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It started as a sort of witch organization,\" Thea said. \"A witch circle. But it\u0027s not just for witches. It\u0027s for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehumans and vampires and werewolves and shapeshifters... and, well, anybody who wants to help Night\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople and humans get along. Come and meet the others and we\u0027ll try to explain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later, Hannah was sitting on a couch with a plate of eggs Benedict, being introduced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is James and Poppy,\" Thea said. \"James is a Redfern on his mother\u0027s side-which makes him a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edescendant of Maya\u0027s.\" She glanced at James with gentle mischief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t pick my parents. Believe me, I didn\u0027t,\" James said to Hannah. He had light brown hair and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethoughtful gray eyes. When he smiled it was impossible not to smile back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody would have picked your parents, Jamie,\" Poppy said, elbowing him. She was very small, but\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethere was a kind of impish wisdom in her face. Her head was a tangle of copper curls and her eyes were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eas green as emeralds. Hannah found her elfin beauty just a little scary... just a little inhuman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re both vampires,\" Thea said, answering Hannah\u0027s unspoken question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t used to be,\" Poppy said. \"James changed me because I was dying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s a soulmate for?\" James said, and Poppy poked him again and then grinned at him. They were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eobviously in love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re-soulmates?\" Hannah spoke softly, wistfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Thea who answered. \"That\u0027s the thing, you see-something is causing Night People to find human\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esoulmates. We witches think that it\u0027s some Power that\u0027s waking up again, making it happen. Some Power\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat\u0027s been asleep for a long time- maybe since the time when Thierry was born.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Hannah understood why Lupe had said she was Circle Daybreak\u0027s type of people. She was part\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But-that\u0027s wonderful,\" she said, speaking slowly and trying to gather her thoughts. \"I mean...\" She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecouldn\u0027t exactly explain why it was so wonderful, but she had a sense of some immense turning point\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebeing reached in the world, of some cycle that was about to end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea was smiling at her. \"I know what you mean. We think so, too.\" She turned and held out a hand to a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003every tall boy with a sweet face, sandy hair, and hazel eyes. \"And this is my soulmate, Eric. He\u0027s human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just barely,\" a boy from the other side of the room said. Eric ignored him and smiled at Hannah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And this is Gillian and David,\" Thea said, moving around the circle. \"Gillian\u0027s a distant cousin of mine, a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewitch, and David\u0027s human. Soulmates, again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGillian was tiny, with white-blond hair that fit her head like a silky cap and deep violet eyes. David had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edark hair, brown eyes, and a lean tanned face. They both smiled at Hannah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea was moving on. \"And next comes Rashel and Quinn. Rashel is human-she used to be a vampire\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehunter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still am. But now I just hunt bad vampires,\" Rashel said coolly. Hannah had an instinctive feeling\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof respect for her. She was tall and seemed to have perfect control of her body. Her hair was black and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher eyes were a fierce and blazing green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Quinn\u0027s a vampire,\" Thea said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn was the boy who\u0027d made the barely-human remark. He was very good-looking, with clean\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efeatures that were strongly chiseled but almost delicate. His hair was as black as Rashel\u0027s, and his eyes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere black, too. He flashed Hannah a smile that, while beautiful, was slightly unnerving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quinn\u0027s the only one here who can compete with you as far as the past goes,\" Thea added. \"He was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emade into a vampire back in the sixteen hundreds, by Hunter Redfern.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn flashed another smile. \"Did you have a life in colonial America? Maybe we\u0027ve met.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah smiled in return, but she was also studying him with interest. He didn\u0027t look older than eighteen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that why everybody here looks so young?\" she asked. \"All the staff, I mean-Nilsson and the other\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eguys in suits. Are they all vampires?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea nodded. \"All made vampires. Lamia, like James, can grow up if they want. But once you make a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehuman into a vampire they stop aging-and you can\u0027t make somebody over nineteen into a vampire. Their\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebodies can\u0027t make the change. They just burn out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah felt an odd chill, almost of premonition. But before she could say anything, a new voice\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einterrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speaking of the lamia, isn\u0027t anybody going to introduce me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThea turned toward the window. \"Sorry, Ash-but if you\u0027re going to sleep over there, you can\u0027t blame\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eus for forgetting you.\" She looked at Hannah. \"This is another Redfern, a cousin of James\u0027s. His name is\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh was gorgeous, lanky and elegant, with ash-blond hair. But what startled Hannah as he got up and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunhurriedly walked to meet her was his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were like Maya\u0027s eyes, shifting color from moment to moment. The resemblance was so striking\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat it was a moment before Hannah could take his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s got Maya\u0027s genes, Hannah thought. He smiled at her, then sprawled on the loveseat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not all of Circle Daybreak, of course,\" Thea said. \"In fact, we\u0027re some of the newest members.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we\u0027re from all over the country-North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, everywhere. But\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThierry called us together specially, to talk about the soulmate principle and the old Powers awakening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was last week, before he found out about you,\" copper-haired Poppy said. \"And before he ran\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eoff. But we\u0027ve been talking without him, trying to figure out what to do next.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah said, \"Whatever it is, I\u0027d like to help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all looked pleased. But Thea said, \"You should think about it first. We\u0027re dangerous people to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re on everybody\u0027s hit list,\" Rashel, the black-haired vampire hunter, said dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got the whole Night World against us,\" Ash said, rolling his ever-changing eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Against us. You just said \u0027us.\u0027 \" James turned on his cousin triumphantly, as if he\u0027d just won a point in an\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eargument. \"You admit you\u0027re a part of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have any\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh looked at the ceiling, choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you do, Hannah,\" Thea interrupted. She smiled at Hannah, but her soft brown eyes were serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to be in any more danger than you are now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think-\" Hannah began. But before she could finish, there was an explosion of noise from somewhere\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eoutside. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-soulmate-night-world-6/page-13.html","bookId":2080,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:27 PM"}
