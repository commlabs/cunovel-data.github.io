Her mind conjured up an image of his dark face all but hidden by at least a fortnight\u0027s growth of thick, black beard, and she shivered at the memory of those strange silver eyes as they\u0027d looked last night with the leaping flames from the fires reflected in them. Today his eyes had been the angry gray of a stormy sky—but there had been a moment, when his eyes had shifted to her mouth, that the expression in their depths had changed—and that indefinable change had made him seem more threatening than ever before. It was his black beard, she told herself bracingly, that made him seem so frightening, for it hid his features. Without that dark beard, he\u0027d doubtless look like any other elderly man of… thirty-five? Forty? She\u0027d heard the legend of him since she was a child of three or four, so he must be very old indeed! She felt better, realizing he was old. \u0027Twas only his beard that made him seem alarming, she reassured herself. His beard, and his daunting height and build, and his strange, silver eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorning came and still she\u0027d come up with no truly feasible plan that would satisfy their need to make all speed as well as hide and to avoid being set upon by bandits, or worse. \"If only we had some men\u0027s clothing,\" Jenny said, not for the first time, \"then we\u0027d have a much better chance, both to escape and to reach our destination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t very well just ask our guard to lend us his,\" Brenna said a little desperately, as fear overwhelmed even her placid disposition. \"I wish I had my sewing,\" she added with a ragged sigh. \"I\u0027m so jumpy I can hardly sit still. Besides, I always think most clearly when I\u0027ve my needle in my hand. Do you suppose our guard would secure a needle for me if I asked him very nicely to do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hardly,\" Jenny replied absently, plucking at the hem of her habit as she gazed out at the men tramping about in war-torn clothes. If anyone needed a needle and thread, it was those men. \"Besides, what would you sew with the—\" Jenny\u0027s voice dropped but her spirits soared, and it was all she could do to smooth the joyous smile from her face as she turned slowly to Brenna. \"Brenna,\" she said in a carefully offhand voice, \"you\u0027re quite right to ask the guard to secure you a needle and thread. He seems nice enough, and I know he finds you lovely. Why don\u0027t you call him over and ask him to get us two needles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny waited, laughing inwardly as Brenna went to the flap of the tent and motioned to the guard. Soon she would tell Brenna the plan, but not yet; Brenna\u0027s face would give her away if she tried to lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a different guard—I don\u0027t know this one at all,\" Brenna whispered in disappointment as the man came toward her. \"Shall I send him to fetch the nice guard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By all means,\" Jenny said, grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSir Eustace was with Royce and Stefan looking over some maps when he was informed by the guard that the ladies were asking for him. \"Is there no end to her arrogance!\" Royce bit out, referring to Jenny. \"She even sends her guards on errands, and what\u0027s more, they run to do her bidding.\" Checking his tirade, he said shortly, \"I assume it was the blue-eyed one with the dirty face who sent you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSir Lionel chuckled and shook his head. \"I saw two clean faces, Royce, but the one who talked to me had greenish eyes, not blue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, I see,\" Royce said sarcastically, \"it wasn\u0027t Arrogance that sent you trotting away from your post, it was Beauty. What does she want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She wouldn\u0027t tell me. Wants to see Eustace, she said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get back to your post and stay there. Tell her to wait,\" he snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Royce, they\u0027re no more than two helpless females,\" the knight reminded him, \"and small ones at that. What\u0027s more, you won\u0027t trust anyone to guard them except Arik or one of us,\" he said, referring to the knights who made up Royce\u0027s elite personal guard and were also trusted friends. \"You\u0027re keeping them bound and under guard like they were dangerous men, able to overpower us and escape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t trust anyone else with the women,\" Royce said, absently rubbing the back of his neck. Abruptly, he lurched out of his chair. \"I\u0027m tired of the inside of this tent. I\u0027ll go with you and see what they want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So will I,\" Stefan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny saw the earl coming, his long effortless strides bringing him swiftly toward their tent, two guards on his right and his brother on the left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" Royce said, stepping into their tent with the three men. \"What is it this time?\" he demanded of Jenny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna whirled around in panic, her hand over her heart, her face a picture of flustered innocence as she hastened to take the blame for annoying him. \"I—it was I who asked for him.\" She nodded in the direction of the guard. \"For Sir Eustace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sigh of impatience, Royce withdrew his gaze from Jenny and looked at her foolish sister. \"Would you care to tell me why you did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was actually all she was going to say, Royce realized. \"Very well, then tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I… we\"—she cast a look of sheer misery at Jenny, then plunged ahead—\"we… would like very much to be given thread and needles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce\u0027s gaze swung suspiciously to the person most likely to have conceived some way of using needles to his own physical discomfort, but today Lady Jennifer Merrick returned his gaze levelly, her face subdued, and he felt an odd sense of disappointment that her bravado had been depleted so quickly. \"Needles?\" he repeated, frowning at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Jenny answered in a carefully modulated voice that was neither challenging nor submissive, but calmly polite as if she\u0027d quietly accepted her fate. \"The days grow long and we have little to do. My sister, Brenna, suggested we spend the time sewing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sewing?\" Royce repeated, disgusted with himself for keeping them bound and under heavy guard. Lionel was right—Jenny was merely a small female. A young, reckless, headstrong girl with more bravado than sense. He\u0027d overestimated her simply because no other prisoner brought before him had dared to strike him. \"What do you think this is, the queen\u0027s drawing room?\" he snapped. \"We don\u0027t have any of those—\" His brain stalled as he searched for the names of the contraptions which women at court spent hours of every day sewing upon with embroidery thread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Embroidery hoops?\" Jenny provided helpfully. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-kingdom-of-dreams-westmoreland-saga-1/page-11.html","bookId":1848,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:10 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:10 PM"}
