If you looked at the island from up above in the sky, it had the appearance of a turtle. This island had been quite a mystery in the Milky Way Sea during past years. It floated about here and there, surrounded by mists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the floating island stopped, and an astonishing bellow of rage could be heard from within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“SCREW OFF!! Bastard! I just fell asleep, and now you come bothering me? You think I want those memories of that twerp Meng Hao? Dammit! SCREW OFF!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatriarch Reliance’s thunderous voice echoed out, kicking up huge waves on the Milky Way Sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe archaic voice anxiously said, “How could something like that even exist!?!? How do I accomplish this severing? How?!?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounded completely flustered and exasperated, shaking because of Meng Hao’s very existence. On another island in the Milky Way Sea was a stooped old man who was currently standing in front of an artist’s easel, painting a picture of the tall, strapping man who stood in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the middle of making a brushstroke, the old man suddenly frowned and looked up into the sky. A profound glow suddenly appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“People who exist in my memory cannot have their Karma severed by the Heavens of Ji,” he said softly. He lifted his right hand into the air and then waved his paintbrush. A drop of ink flew out which then merged into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, the entire sky in the region turned completely black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA miserable shriek could be heard echoing out from the void. The voice was none other than that of ancient Ji Nineteen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the shriek filled the air, all of the Cultivators who were affected by the destruction of the Karma threads suddenly shook. The threads connecting them to Meng Hao, suddenly began to recover. They returned from absolute destruction to form once again. In fact, because they were being reformed out of destruction, they were even stronger and more tenacious than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChu Yuyan’s face was pale white. Her closed eyes opened, and she looked silently at the character ‘Meng’ written on the wall. She slowly lifted her hand up and wrote the character ‘Hao.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePill Demon put away the medicinal pill and looked wordlessly off into the distance. However, his eyes were filled with staunchness and determination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFatty rubbed his head as he thought confusedly about past events. Suddenly, his body trembled and he gasped. There were now many more memories of the past. His face flickered as he recalled Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChen Fan was the same, as was the entirety of the lands of the Southern Domain. In the Black Lands and the Western Desert, all of the Cultivators whose Karma threads had been affected, were suddenly recovered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXu Qing gnawed at her lip silently. She looked at the pill bottle in her hand, and her eyes filled with deep anxiety. She now remembered everything that had happened, and was filled with coldness. She could only imagine the loneliness she would experience if Meng Hao’s image did not exist within her memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin her silence, she clenched her teeth. She knew that power was the only way to truly resolve problems. She was now more determined than ever to fully fuse with the memories of Matriarch Phoenix, and increase the level of her Cultivation base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in the Western Desert, in the Crow Divinity Holy Land, within the depths of the volcano, Meng Hao stood trembling in the Pool of Destiny. He, too, heard the miserable shriek. As it echoed about, he opened his eyes to see the silver fishing line turning black. The blackness spread, and as it did, the line turned into smoke and ashes. The ash and smoke spread out amidst the shriek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of the shriek caused Meng Hao’s eyes to glow with coldness. He hadn’t been able to see what had happened just now, but he had witnessed the severing of the Karma of the old earthworm man. He could only imagine the death he had just experienced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKilling intent radiated out from his eyes as he caught sight of an indistinct figure in front of him. It was the image of a Cultivator surrounded by black flames, screaming as he struggled to disappear from this place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe indistinct figure was repeatedly calling out a name. “Shui Dongliu, it’s Shui Dongliu….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes glittered. His left hand raised up and placed the blood-colored mask onto his face. Massive, frenzied power exploded from his Cultivation base. Blood Qi emanated out in waves as he charged forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood Finger. Blood Palm. Blood Death World!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all appeared, causing massive roaring to fill the air as they descended upon the illusory figure. Meng Hao’s killing intent soared as he waved his hand again. The Lotus Sword Formation appeared; as it rotated, the power of Time rippled out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“DIE!” shouted Meng Hao, his voice ice cold. His hand flickered an incantation and he pointed forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Violet Qi Guillotine, Violet Qi Garrote, Violet Gibbous Moon exploded out with a roar, causing violet light to billow up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Without a face, a single word, the flames of war unify!” Meng Hao lifted up his left hand and pressed down onto the mask. Immediately, a gigantic face appeared. It opened its mouth and spoke a voiceless word. A roaring sound filled the air as it shot toward the illusory figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the miserable screaming continued, Meng Hao charged forward, slipping on the Fang Clan glove. He punched, and a massive rumbling could be heard. Meng Hao’s killing intent soared as he punched over and over again, more than a hundred times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach of these fists contained incredible power. Rumbling sounded out without end, and the illusory figure seemed to be on the verge of bursting into pieces. It appeared to have been sealed, rendering it incapable of making any moves whatsoever; even its Cultivation base was weak beyond compare. It was still trying to disappear and escape, but Meng Hao performed another incantation, and the Eighth Demon Sealing Hex appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the figure suddenly stopped moving, Meng Hao’s face distorted with the desire to kill. None of his magical arts seemed to have any effect on this figure. And yet, Meng Hao was not willing to let him escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had killed one of the sons of Ji, and he wasn’t afraid to kill this Ji Nineteen. That was especially true considering that if he didn’t kill him right now, when he was at his weakest, then the man would no doubt cause endless troubles in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGritting his teeth, Meng Hao pressed down again onto the blood-colored mask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Flag of three streamers!” he growled. This was the most powerful magical item he possessed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering the current level of his Cultivation base, he could, with effort, wield one streamer. This time, it didn’t appear in illusory form, either. As soon as the words left his mouth, power filled the area as a long, blood-colored streamer appeared. As soon as it left Meng Hao’s hand, Heaven and Earth shook. It shot forward, wrapping around the figure of Ji Nineteen, dragging him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJi Nineteen let out a horrified scream filled with shock, fear, and disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This… this is… the Mountain and Sea Emperor’s Banner!” He cried out in alarm as roaring shook his body. Suddenly, what had been illusory, only partly in the same world as Meng Hao, was now forcibly dragged out. There, standing directly in front of Meng Hao, was an old man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was clearly in very sore straits; his face was covered with a burning, black ink, and his aura was in absolute chaos. Currently, it seemed he was being forcibly repressed, and was now only able to wield the power of Core Formation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was filled with astonishment. He could scarcely believe that he had actually been pulled into this world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Impossible! It can’t be the Emperor’s Banner. The legendary Emperor’s Banner was destroyed….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What Emperor’s Banner, b*tch!?” said Meng Hao, his face contorted with fury as he thought about how he had just basically died. Then he recalled what Shui Dongliu had said years ago, that people he remembered could not have their Karma severed by the Ji Clan. He was certain that without Shui Dongliu, he would most likely be dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his fury, he unthinkingly imitated the parrot’s wording. With that, he clenched his hand into a fist and punched. A boom filled the air, and the old man let out a cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You trifling mortal, do you dare to injure me? You….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBOOM!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you dare to kill me!?!?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBOOM!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao struck out repeatedly with his incredibly powerful fist, pummelling the old man until his body was on the verge of exploding. However, the man’s Cultivation base was fundamentally intrepid. Despite being attacked in such a way, his body was recovering rapidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Puny mortal, you injured me and dragged me out from the world of Ji. But just wait until I’m fully recovered. I’ll kill you with my bare hands!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes flickered with coldness, and retracted his right hand. He glared coldly at the old man, which caused the old man to stare in shock. Then, the old man began to laugh coldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant he began to laugh, however, Meng Hao’s right hand flickered an incantation and then he pushed down onto the old man’s forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It would be a pity to kill you. However, your blood, along with the blood of that son of Ji that I killed, can help me to create my Blood Spirit!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My recovery will quickly outpace whatever tiny injuries you inflict on me,” said the old man, his tone vicious. Suddenly, Meng Hao waved his hand, and the Lotus Sword Formation appeared. Rippling power of Time flowed out, relentlessly pounding against the old man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man’s face fell, but he let out a cold snort nonetheless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If it were twice as powerful, maybe it could affect me. But that level of Time power is simply not enough!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not enough?” asked Meng Hao, his eyes flickering icily. He instantly produced his four wooden swords and stabbed them into the man’s body to hinder his recovery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man was inherently tyrannical and haughty, but the instant he saw the four wooden swords, and especially when they stabbed into him, he had no choice but to scream miserably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit! Dammit! Those are… Immortal Murdering Swords!! You, you, you… just who are you?! How can you have so many!! Although they’re not completely unsealed… they really are Immortal Murdering Swords!!” His injuries suddenly worsened, and his recovery slowed down to a crawl. Thanks to Meng Hao’s many forms of torment, Ji Nineteen was in an incredibly wretched predicament.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s still more time to cause you suffering!” said Meng Hao, coldness flickering within his gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the Great Tang in the Eastern Lands exists a luxurious mansion. Sitting inside was the girl with the explosive temper that Meng Hao had met that year, Fang Yu. She was currently wiping some blood off of her mouth; how could Ji Nineteen ever have imagined that the effects of his Karmic Severing would reach all the way to the Great Tang in the Eastern Lands, and Fang Yu? [1. Meng Hao met Fang Yu in \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/issth-book-3-chapter-309/\"\u003echapter 309\u003c/a\u003e, in the events leading up to the end of book 3. She initially attacked him, but backed off after seeing the mark on his hand, whereupon she threw an epic temper tantrum]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFang Yu’s face filled with fury, and she rose to her feet. She was about to walk out the door when suddenly a woman’s voice could be heard, shocking and furious to the extreme. It came from the restricted area in the back of the mansion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“JI CLAN!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she heard the voice, Fang Yu’s face flickered. She saw someone flying out from the restricted area toward her. It was an elegantly dressed middle-aged woman. Her face was beautiful, but grim. As soon as she appeared, everything grew dim, and the air itself began to vibrate. The land quaked, and cracks appeared on the surfaces of the nearby buildings, despite the restrictive spells that protected them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mom….” said Fang Yu, trembling. She feared no one in the world more than she did her mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You, come with me!” said the woman. This woman was none other than the woman who had appeared in the Song Clan back in the Southern Domain. Her eyes radiated killing intent as she turned toward the Ji Clan mansion which existed in the Great Tang of the Eastern Lands. [2. This woman appeared in \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/issth-book-2-chapter-190/\"\u003echapter 190\u003c/a\u003e as well as subsequent chapters.
