No embarrassment. No trying to cover her naked body. Hell, she didn’t even shriek with surprise. She just stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I forgot how much you and Luke sound alike.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wasn’t tryin’ to pretend to be him,” Brandt said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat comment brought her sad smile. “I know. There’s no comparison.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was that kicked-in-the-heart sensation again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why did you stick around? I wasn’t very nice to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis thoughts skipped back to Jessie’s bored appraisal of him and her insulting parting shot. “I intended to take off. B-but…” Goddammit. Why was he such a stammering freakin’ idiot around her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you didn’t because you were worried about me.” She held his gaze. “Why? Luke would have left me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not Luke.” Like he needed to remind her of that fact, after she’d already done such a bang up job of reminding him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know that too, Brandt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you? Do you really?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned, almost as if she’d heard his internal thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on. Get dressed and I’ll take you home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie shook her head. “I’m staying here with Mike.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why in the hell would you do that?” he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because he treats me like I’m sexy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Christ, Jessie. He almost treated you to a gang bang.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe that’s what I want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh-uh. I know you and that’s not you talkin’.” Brandt pointed to the bottle of Southern Comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s the booze talkin’.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camper door slammed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tossed her head. “Maybe you don’t know me as well as you think you do, McKay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe emphasis on McKay, as if it were some sort of disease, had Brandt seeing red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant Mike swayed into the doorway, Jessie scooted to the end of the bed, cooing, “What took you so long?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why? Didja miss me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep. Let’s get this party started.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnough. Brandt pushed to his feet. “I’m outta here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike shot Brandt a stoned look. “I thought you were gonna watch us fuck? You know. Like live porn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen phrased that way? Jesus. It made him sound like a loser who couldn’t score his own woman. He looked at Jessie—just as she started to slide off the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandt dove for her, snaking his arm around her waist, bringing her naked back against his chest as he anchored himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dude.” Mike blinked at him. “Talk about Superman reflexes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s Brandt. A superhero in the flesh. A boy scout. A real trooper. The ultimate gentleman cowboy, always willing to lend a hand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d known each other for four years and that’s how Jessie saw him? A damn do-gooder? While some guys might like those comparisons, he didn’t. Not at all. Especially not from Jessie. Especially not tonight when he was skating so close to the edge of disproving that gentleman cowboy remark to her in explicit detail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she wasn’t done taunting him. “He’s the guy who always does the right thing. Which is why he’ll skip out, even if he wants to stay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with that smartass comment…Jessie had pushed him too far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know, on second thought, I do believe I will stick around and lend a hand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie gasped when Brandt brought them down on the edge of the mattress. He hooked her legs over the tops of his thighs, then moved her body forward so her ass hung off the bed. After circling her wrists with his fingers, he rested on his elbows and placed her palms flat on the mattress and nestled his groin against her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You hold her and I’ll go first. Then it’ll be your turn,” Mike promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squirmed, sliding her smooth shoulders against Brandt’s bare chest. The friction of his swimming trunks rubbing against his cock as her body writhed on his instantly turned his cock into granite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandt allowed his gaze to drop to the Mike’s groin after he ditched his cutoffs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell? Mike’s dick hung between his scrawny thighs like a limp worm. Seeing Jessie’s naked body spread out for him like a feast didn’t affect him at all? Jesus. How would that make Jessie feel?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe she’s so drunk she won’t notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time, Brandt hoped that was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill you step in and show her how she affects you if this douche fucker can’t get it up?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. But that didn’t mean he couldn’t distract her. Brandt angled his head and spoke quietly. “Jessie, is this really what you want?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I-I d-don’t… Yes,” she reiterated firmly, “it’s what I want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then close your eyes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do it,” he said harshly. Then he softened toward her, in mind and body, nuzzling the tender, fragrant skin behind her ear. “Just close your eyes. I’ve got you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA heartbeat or two later, Jessie relaxed into him, turning her head so her rapid breaths drifted across his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that moment he wanted her with an ache that defied reason. It went beyond sex. It went beyond anything he’d ever felt before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandt tore his attention away from Jessie and looked up at Mike—who frowned at the state of his non-responsive dick. Mike knocked back a slug of Southern Comfort and set the bottle aside. His fingers traced the inside of Jessie’s thighs as he leaned over to suck her right nipple into his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie arched and she tried to move her hands to touch Mike, but Brandt held her firmly. She wiggled, moaning as Mike kissed down her belly and staggered to his knees. Brandt knew the instant Mike’s mouth connected with Jessie’s sex. Her back bowed as if she’d been touched by a defibrillator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoddammit. This was so fucking bizarre, but also almost…erotic, holding her, feeling her body’s response as another man pleasured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whimpered, “Yes. Please. More.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike kept a slurred dialogue, extolling the virtues of Jessie’s pussy in outdated porn terms, which he probably believed turned her on. But the idiot didn’t notice Jessie reacted most strongly when he quit flapping his gums and put his mouth on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Mike got to it, spiking Brandt’s jealousy to epic proportions to hear Mike’s slurping, sucking noises from between Jessie’s quivering thighs. He wanted to be the one eking out her feminine sighs and moans. He wanted to be the one tasting her. He wanted to be the one driving her to the brink of ecstasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweat broke out on his brow. On the back of his neck. Moisture coated his balls. And it didn’t help that Jessie’s sexy, slippery body was sliding all over his. Specifically against his impatient cock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA loud thud sounded and Jessie’s thrashing stopped abruptly. Brandt released her wrists to see what the hell the noise was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessie maneuvered her body away from Brandt’s. They peered over the edge of the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly shit. Mike had passed out cold on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the middle of going down on Jessie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfuckingbelievable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whispered, “You think he had a heart attack or something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she wasn’t frantically checking him over, which meant she wasn’t so out of it she couldn’t see the truth. She nudged his leg. “Mike?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike let out a soft snore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again Brandt’s heart broke when Jessie made a soft sob. She scampered away from him quickly, like a crab sinking back into the sand. “Jessie—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just go away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I’m takin’ you home. Where are your clothes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFocusing on his anger on her behalf kept him from pitying her. “Fine.” Brandt tossed the comforter over her, rolled her like a sausage, and lifted her into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gasped, “What’re you doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Takin’ you home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I’m naked!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wasn’t like that swimsuit covered up much anyway.” And yeah, when Brandt stepped over Mike’s sprawled form, he might’ve kicked the guy’s ribs. The idiot wouldn’t have noticed if he’d been kicked in his numb nuts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Put me down, Brandt. I mean it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No way in hell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe walk from the camper to his truck was mighty long and mighty quiet. He deposited her in the passenger side of his pickup before he climbed in. After he started backing out, she said, “Wait.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? You feel like you’re gonna barf?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I forgot my purse.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bit her lip. “I’m pretty sure it’s still in the cab of Mike’s pickup.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandt whipped a U-turn and followed the bumpy trail from the public parking area back to the campsites. He pulled up behind Mike’s camper and shut off his truck, pocketing the keys. He issued a stern,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t go nowhere, Jessie, I mean it,” and bailed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pungent scent of pot smoke wafted out of Mike’s truck as Brandt opened the door. A roach clip dangled from the rearview mirror, weighted with feathers and skinny strips of leather. He pushed aside food wrappers and empty beer cans until he found a small bright orange fanny pack. Since he’d forgotten to ask specifics about size and color, he unzipped the main compartment. His hand froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t the unopened package of condoms that snared his interest, but the hand-tooled leather wallet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wallet he’d made Jessie for Christmas—in what turned out to be the only Christmas they’d spent together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ragged edge of Brandt’s thumb traced the row of flowers he’d so painstakingly pounded out in the supple leather above the metal clasp. After he’d tanned the row a rich brown and finished the rough edges with a leather whipstitch, he’d painted each tiny flower a different color. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cowgirls-don-t-cry-rough-riders-10/page-2.html","bookId":2691,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:18:11 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:18:11 AM"}
