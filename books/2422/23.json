Nothing crazy at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex’s room was just down the hall on the left. The door was locked, which was a first. I’d started to think nobody at the hotel ever locked doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alex!” I yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe noise of the storm was louder on this end of the hall. It almost sounded like it was inside his room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pounded on the door. Still nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImelda stood next to me, twisting her apron. Jose’s body was turned away from me, like he was trying to evade me, though I wasn’t sure why. It seemed odd that just a few hours ago, I’d thought of him as a man with a perpetual smile. That smile was long gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have the key?” I asked them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImelda’s eyes widened. “Señor Huff is the owner. He told us never to enter without permission.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t clean his room?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you have to have a master key.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…Back downstairs,” Imelda said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Downstairs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded halfheartedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Jose. “You?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, señor. I’m just the cook. I have no master key.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine,” I said. “I’ll break down the door.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJose tensed. Imelda started to say, “Señor—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my shoulder to the door and smashed it open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside, the room was a wreck. The window had been demolished, but the wood splinters and glass shards pointed toward the storm, as if something had been hurled out. A strip of torn red cloth fluttered from one jagged tooth of glass. The curtain was sprinkled with pink spots, like diluted blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to come up with some other explanation, but I kept coming back to the same conclusion. Someone had been pushed out the second-story window. And whoever it was had been wearing a shirt the same color as Alex Huff’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e26\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia couldn’t sleep. The pangs had passed, but they’d scared her worse than she’d let on. She lay on her side, trying to keep still. Lane Sanford was also awake. She was curled in the other bed with Garrett sitting at her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We used to have storms at the ranch,” Lane said. “Once lightning hit a tree and it burned almost an acre. But I’ve never seen anything like this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your family ranch?” Maia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No…Bobby rented the place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLane spoke his name like a cuss word she’d trained herself to say, a word proper ladies weren’t supposed to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should get a restraining order,” Maia said. “I’d be happy to help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t,” Lane said. “Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer tone was final. There was a secret there she wasn’t ready to share yet. Abuse, probably. Something else, too—something Lane thought she couldn’t bring to the police. The problem with working criminal cases so long: Maia could come up with a whole array of depressing possibilities, all equally plausible and horrible. And yet she could still be surprised. The worst violence, the most awful forms of depravity, always happened in a so-called loving relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least that made it easier for her to count her blessings. Whatever faults Tres had—however much he tortured himself with guilt or wrestled with his own demons—he was kind. He was a good man. He’d make a good father, Maia had no doubt, whatever happened with the baby. She depended on that. She counted on him so much it scared her. And she tried to tell herself Tres would be safe. They would make it through this weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe storm rumbled overhead like an endless train. Noises from the other rooms eventually died down. Lane closed her eyes and began breathing deeply. Garrett stayed at his post at the foot of her bed, his hand protectively on her ankle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia studied Garrett’s face, looking for similarities to Tres. The hawkish nose and green eyes were the same. Garrett hid his chin behind a scraggly beard, but she imagined it was the same as Tres’s—a strong jawline, hinting at stubbornness. Time had not been as kind to Garrett, though. He was the same age as Maia. She remembered they had talked about that when they first met, how both of them were just turning forty. His complexion had turned sallow from too many years of hard drinking. His eyes were constantly bloodshot. His hair was frosted with gray. But he was still handsome in an unkempt way. He looked at her and smiled, and Maia couldn’t help feeling a little better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You doing all right, darlin’?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Worried about Tres.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, hell. He’ll be fine. That bastard will drive you crazy if you keep worrying about him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have a point.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve known him longer, darlin’. I just hope that baby gets some of your good looks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’ll be beautiful, I’m sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The last few days, I’ve started to think of the baby as a he.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A nephew to corrupt. I could handle that. Uncle Garrett…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia pictured Garrett with a baby in his lap, the two of them taking joy rides in the wheelchair. The baby would be wearing a tie-dyed jumper, a miniature Jimmy Buffett hat. “Did you ever think about getting married?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced down at Lane. “I’m not exactly an attractive package, in case you hadn’t noticed. Kind of an extreme fixer-upper.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t sell yourself short.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re telling this to a man without legs?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know I didn’t mean it that way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFootsteps in the hall. Maia hoped it was Tres coming back, but it was only Mr. Lindy and the college boy Ty. Ty was clutching his stomach as if he were sick, and Mr. Lindy was helping him walk. They didn’t look inside the room as they passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maia, you’re lucky,” Garrett told her at last. “You and Tres. You stuck with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It wasn’t easy,” Maia promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I used to think there was a perfect match out there for everybody, you know? Alex told me that. Older I get, I realize there’s just matches you make work, and matches you give up on. Ain’t nothing perfect about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll find the right person, Garrett.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scratched his beard. “That’s not what worries me. Question is, will the right person stick around?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the dim light, the lines on his face seemed deeply etched. His hair looked even more gray than usual. He gazed down at Lane Sanford as she slept, as if trying to memorize her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia felt the baby kick. She put her hand against her belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boy, she thought. And though she had never been religious, she prayed: Please, let him be healthy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why don’t you get some sleep, darlin’?” Garrett told her. “I’ll wake you if anything happens.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to stay up. She wanted to wait for Tres to return safely. But her eyelids were as heavy as lead. She closed them and drifted off, imagining Tres holding the hand of the baby as he took his first step away from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e27\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJose took his eyes from the broken window. “Señor?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You didn’t want me to come in here. What happened to Alex?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, no longer evasive. Just bewildered. “I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shard of glass shook loose from the window frame. It flew past us, embedding itself in the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Señor, we must leave,” Imelda said. “Señor—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed toward the window, screening my face with my hands. The dark shape of the lighthouse loomed through the horizontal rain. The ocean churned below, waves surging against the side of the house. If Alex had fallen into that maelstrom, there was no chance of finding him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI yanked the piece of red fabric off of the window. A piece of Alex’s shirt. No doubt about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Señor!” Imelda shouted over the storm. “Please!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWind buffeted me back into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t want to leave, but the glass and debris were too dangerous to contend with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped back and tripped over something hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down. It was a wooden statue of a woman, about two feet tall, carved from cedar. The details, especially the face, were amazingly intricate. She had her arms crossed, one hand raised palm up, as if she were asking a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth tasted like metal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was sure of two things about the statue—two things that were impossible to reconcile. First, this was the same statue I’d seen Alex Huff carving when I was a child, the day I’d surprised him in the lighthouse. Second, the woman’s face looked a lot like a young mother I’d recently seen in a photograph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked like Rachel Lindy Brazos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett crumpled the piece of red fabric. “You’re telling me Alex jumped?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I doubt it was suicide. If he went out that window, he was pushed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No way, little bro. So his window was broken. So what? Half the windows in the place are broken.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was busted from the inside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s not dead,” Garrett insisted. “We gotta search the house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t answer. I didn’t mention the wooden statue I’d left in the bedroom. I still couldn’t process what I’d seen—the adult face of Rachel Brazos, carved in cedar by Alex Huff when Rachel and he would’ve both been teenagers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine,” Garrett said. He glanced over at the beds, where Maia and Lane were both asleep. “I’ll search outside. Little bro, you stay here for a change.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Garrett, you can’t. It’s too dangerous.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis stare was a little on the crazy side. “I’m not gonna sit here if something’s happened to Alex.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll find him,” I promised, but I was thinking about the ocean pounding the walls of the house, washing over the entire island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a loud knock behind me. “Tres.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenjamin Lindy stood in the doorway, looking weary and rumpled from his time with the college guys. He’d lost his tie. A strand of gray hair curled over his forehead, geriatric Superman-style. “I need to talk to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What a coincidence,” I said. I turned to Garrett. “Give me two minutes. We’ll figure it out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett glared at me like I’d just suggested torching a Jimmy Buffett album, but he nodded grudgingly. “Two minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the hall, Lindy looked around to make sure we were alone. “That young man, Ty. I took him to the bathroom just now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s terrific news.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t understand. He asked me to take him to the bathroom in his own room to get some Tylenol. He orchestrated that so he could talk to me away from his friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLindy’s eyes were as cold as steel. “He has something to tell you privately. He says it has to do with Chris Stowall’s murder.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTy sat at the bottom of the stairwell, watching the water lap against the steps. In the dim light of the hallway fixture, he looked like a wax figure, his face soft and sallow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chase and Markie?” he asked nervously. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rebel-island-tres-navarre-7/page-23.html","bookId":2422,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:34:57 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:34:57 PM"}
