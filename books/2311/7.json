She thought that she probably could have walked away, anonymous in her booties and scrubs, before anyone thought to look for her, but she didn\u0027t. Loyalty to Pansy won out against an atavistic desire to just get the hell out, and besides, McCarthy was there, looking sardonic and grim. The nasal swabs were exciting, and the industrial-strength shower and shampoo even more so. Fresh medical garb awaited at the end, but this time she wasn\u0027t alone; both McCarthy and Pansy had been given hospital couture as well. McCarthy\u0027s hair was damp and sticking up in points. Pansy looked well-scrubbed and a little less scared. \"Doxycycline,\" the doctor said, and handed over a giant bottle to each of them. \"Take it as indicated. If your tests come back negative, you can discontinue it immediately, but if not, keep taking it. No skips. Continue to the end of the regimen, no matter how good you feel. Tell us immediately if you get any symptoms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Symptoms?\" Pansy said faintly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fever\u0027s the first sign,\" he said. \"I want to see all of you in three days, sooner if you have even the slightest rise in temperature or start feeling under the weather. Clear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we get symptoms - \" Pansy began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you check in here, and we start you on an IV antibiotic course. But we don\u0027t even know that what you\u0027ve been exposed to is dangerous, and even if it is, we certainly don\u0027t know that you came into contact with any significant amount, or contracted anything from it. Lots of don\u0027t-knows and it\u0027s in there.\" He shrugged. \"Just relax. Chances are you\u0027ll be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t the most caring doctor Lucia had ever met, but she appreciated his clear-eyed, blunt approach. Even if he did look barely old enough to have graduated from high school, much less completed any kind of medical school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes met hers, and she was surprised to find that he wasn\u0027t nearly as young as he looked. Not inside, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good luck,\" he said, and held out his hand. She shook. He had a firm grip, soft, strong fingers. \"Three days, back here, or I send the FBI to handcuff you and bring you in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that, it appeared, was that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes later, Pansy\u0027s cell phone rang. She unfolded it. \"Hello?\" Her face brightened and took on a little color. \"Manny! Any news?\" Pansy, Lucia was amused to note, was like watching the news with the sound off. \"Oh. Okay.\" Obviously, no results yet, but then she perked up again. \"Yes! Yes, fine...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she hung up, Lucia said, \"You\u0027re going over to his place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePansy paused in the act of putting her phone back in her purse, obviously surprised. \"How did you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remind me not to put you undercover, Pansy. And besides, I think I know Manny well enough to know that he\u0027s not going to allow you to go home alone. Since he\u0027s working, he\u0027ll want you there, where he can watch out for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePansy blinked and smiled. \"Kinda nice, isn\u0027t it? Having somebody care?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Lucia, on impulse, reached over and took her hand. \"You may have saved my life, you know. I don\u0027t forget that kind of thing. Anything you need, Pansy, I\u0027ll deliver.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t an idle promise, and Pansy must have known it. She squeezed Lucia\u0027s fingers, and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d better get moving,\" she said. \"He\u0027s sending a car for me. Knowing Manny, it\u0027ll be a Bradley Fighting Vehicle, with a full squad of off-duty marines.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia smiled a goodbye and let her walk away. Pansy looked small and fragile, but there was a core of inner steel in her that Jazz must have sensed the first time she\u0027d met her. A fighter, that one. She\u0027d been cool and calm when she\u0027d spotted the problem, and not many people could have handled it with such grace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about you?\" McCarthy. He was standing next to her. Some people appeared ridiculous in scrubs, but he managed to carry more gravitas than the doctor who\u0027d just walked away in his official lab coat. Light blue suited Ben, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I\u0027ll go home,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t imagine I\u0027ll be able to sleep much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded and opened the plastic bag they\u0027d given him for the contents of his pockets. All he had was a wallet she supposed was left over from before his incarceration, some keys, and the assorted motel keycards that Omar had procured. Rawlins had asked for his gun, and hadn\u0027t asked to see the permit. She\u0027d have to see if she could borrow a gun from Omar for McCarthy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOmar. She\u0027d forgotten about him. She\u0027d have to call and tell him to take a few days off - or better yet, see if he could trace the fake FedEx. Pity she hadn\u0027t opened the red envelope all the way. She dearly wanted to know what they\u0027d had to say. Whoever they happened to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcCarthy fished the keys out of the bag in his hand and shook them lightly with a bemused expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just thinking. Jazz put my car and apartment stuff into storage, but I guess I should pick up the car, at least. Most of these keys don\u0027t mean much anymore. Apartment\u0027s gone. Office - well, I don\u0027t think they were saving my desk in the squad room. Anyway, I think I\u0027ll pick up the car, then head for the motel.\" He still wasn\u0027t looking at her. \"Unless you want to grab some dinner. You\u0027ve got to be hungry by now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Starving, actually. We could eat, then I could give you a ride to your car.\" She smiled slowly. \"Besides, I\u0027m the only one who\u0027s actually armed, I believe. Unless you\u0027re hiding a gun somewhere I don\u0027t want to know about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like to boast about my weapons.\" He dropped the keys back in the bag and followed her out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer car was downstairs, in non-emergency parking. They got in and she drove silently through the moderate nighttime traffic to Vine Street. Odd that she didn\u0027t feel a need to talk, and even odder that she didn\u0027t feel awkward with his silence. He was thinking, she sensed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are we eating?\" he asked, as she slowed and turned into the parking garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Best pizza in town,\" she replied. \"Delivered. Sorry, but I can\u0027t stand being in these scrubs another moment. We can pick up your car after.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t comment, just raised his eyebrows a little. She key-carded into the parking garage and found her spot, then led the way to the elevators. They let them in the lobby, which was vast, cool, and had two security guards on duty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ms. Garza.\" The first one nodded. \"Evening. Should I even ask about...?\" He gestured at her clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Marsh, I\u0027d rather you didn\u0027t,\" she said. \"This is my friend Mr. McCarthy. Ben, they\u0027ll need your driver\u0027s license. Nothing personal. This is a high-security building.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How high-security?\" McCarthy asked, and handed over his license. Marsh scanned it in and handed it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t talk about that,\" he said, and smiled. He was a huge man, intimidating when the situation called for it, but generally good-natured. Lucia liked him. She especially liked that he never let anybody he didn\u0027t know pass without ID. \"Let\u0027s just say Ms. Garza here isn\u0027t the most high-profile resident we\u0027ve got.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jagger and Clapton both keep apartments here,\" she said. \"For when they come to town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re kidding. To Kansas City?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Home of the blues.\" She shrugged. \"You\u0027d be surprised. This place has millionaires, CEOs, a few movie stars. I\u0027m lucky they let a peon like me in the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re good to go, Mr. McCarthy,\" Marsh said. \"Check in before you leave via intercom. Elevators won\u0027t work without a passkey or us releasing one for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcCarthy was looking at her as she slid her passkey into the slot in the apartment elevators and pushed the button for the sixth floor. \"What?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"You must be loaded, living in a place like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s say I have resources.\" Not that she was particularly proud of how she\u0027d come by them. The elevator rode smoothly up to six and dinged arrival, releasing them into a corridor with gleaming white walls, original artwork at regular intervals and deep plush carpeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jagger live next door?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has his own floor,\" she said, and led Ben to the second door on the right. Two key locks. Once she\u0027d ushered him in, she flipped on the lights and went to the control panel to shut off the intrusion alarms. The blinking lights went from red to a steady, soothing green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn,\" McCarthy was murmuring. \"So I guess breakfast at Raphael\u0027s was just par for the course for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced around, seeing it through his eyes. A sleek, modern kitchen in black and golden woods; a panoramic view past the dining table. A balcony out past the living room, overlooking the city. It was comfortable and classic, and it had virtually nothing of her personality in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like a really nice hotel,\" he said. \"This how you live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty much,\" she said, and went to pick up the phone. She called the pizza place and ordered two large pies. McCarthy, it seemed, was a meat-lover. She wasn\u0027t much surprised. Hers remained, of course, vegetarian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make yourself at home,\" she said, and picked up the TV remote from the low coffee table. She tossed it to him, and he fielded it without hesitation. \"You said you missed TV. Have at it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked past him and grabbed clothes from the closet before making her way to the bathroom to change. She heard the TV start up as she was pulling on a black knit top. Baseball, it sounded like. Men, she thought, and smiled. Her hair needed brushing. She took care of it and thought about applying makeup, but it seemed ridiculous at this point. She looked tired, but she\u0027d come by it honestly, and no amount of concealer was going to help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou realize, she told her reflection, that you\u0027re thinking about makeup and appearances when you\u0027re about to eat pizza. With an employee, no less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnsettling. She shook her head, tossed her sleek black hair back over her shoulders and went out into the apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcCarthy was on the couch, feet up, watching - yes, she\u0027d been right - baseball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beer?\" she asked. He turned to look at her, and kept looking. \"I assume beer and baseball still go together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" he said, and muted the sound on the TV. \"It\u0027s been awhile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether he meant baseball or something else was open to interpretation. He stood up and joined her in the kitchen as she opened the refrigerator and pulled out a cold bottle. Imported beer, the only kind she willingly drank. She popped the cap with an opener and handed it to him, opened a soft drink for herself, then clinked their bottles together. \"To surviving another day,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey tipped bottles and drank. McCarthy was still watching her, but his eyes closed when the taste of the beer hit his tongue. Sheer ecstasy, from the look on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow,\" he said, when he put the bottle down on the counter. \"It really has been awhile. And obviously, you know beer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I try.\" She took down two plates. \"You want to tell me anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like your theory on why the evidence exonerating you showed up so conveniently when it did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took another sip of beer. Stalling for time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t seem very convenient to me,\" he said. \"Considering I\u0027d already had the crap beaten out of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe they decided you\u0027d suffered enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s just say that little things like compassion don\u0027t enter into the equation for the Cross Society. And I mean that literally, by the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slid onto a bar stool and sipped from her bottle. She hadn\u0027t offered a glass; he hadn\u0027t seemed to mind. \"I don\u0027t think I understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What Simms does - you understand about him, right? That he\u0027s looking at alternate realities, not just telling the future?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcCarthy shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh boy. You\u0027ll need a lot of beer, somebody smarter than me and some kind of consulting physicist.\" He shrugged. \"Okay. There\u0027s this thing called string theory. Don\u0027t ask me how it works - I\u0027m just a cop, okay? But the idea is that there are a whole bunch of realities all layered up against each other. Every decision everybody makes, there\u0027s a slightly different chain of events, right? Take six billion people times about a billion decisions - good, bad or indifferent - and you get how many potential realities we\u0027re dealing with here. The thing is, most of these decisions end up being meaningless, in the great scheme of things. They cancel each other out, and such. So instead of sixty fazillion realities, you get some manageable number, like a couple of million that simultaneously exist in the here and now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia listened, thinking hard. Mostly, she happened to be thinking that she\u0027d never really believed the unlikely story of the Cross Society, or Max Simms, though Jazz seemed to have come closer to buying it, and Jazz was hardly the credulous type. \"So, Simms supposedly can use all this theory to predict the future.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Simms is the real deal, he\u0027s some kind of savant. He doesn\u0027t need theory to do what he does - he just sees it. Like some psychic in the circus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why the physics explanation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what where the Cross Society comes in. They made what he does scientific.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. And Eidolon...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen flipped a hand in assent. \"Started out the same way, but Eidolon took it further. Has to do with predictive math, or something. Both the Cross Society and Eidolon can track decisions and look at the different outcomes. Only problem is, once playing god gets to be a multiplayer game, it gets nasty. Eidolon actually came first, by the way. It got a ton of defense department money, and Simms actually worked with a staff of high-level physicists to develop a computer system that could do what he did. That was his mistake. He created himself right out of a job. Then he founded the Cross Society to do the same thing, once he realized Eidolon was going to manipulate events to their own advantage. Counter of a countermove.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And when Eidolon wanted him gone...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The new CEO made sure that he was taken out of the picture. I figure Simms should have been killed, but he managed to work the decision tree enough that he only got convicted and sent to prison. You\u0027d better believe that Eidolon\u0027s been working hard to keep him there, or better yet, make sure he dies behind bars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know all this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was in early.\" McCarthy shrugged and turned his beer bottle in neat, precise circles. \"Simms wanted people in the Cross Society who could carry out orders, not just sit around and talk theory. I was...\" He fell silent for a few seconds, eyes hooded. \"I was supposed to help them make things better. But I figured out pretty fast that wasn\u0027t how it worked. You start out fighting the good fight, but pretty soon you\u0027re just fighting for your life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you didn\u0027t agree.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a drink, then another. \"I didn\u0027t say that. I\u0027m no saint, Lucia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you agreed, then why did the Cross Society put you in prison?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you. I refused to carry out an order.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To stand by and let Jazz get killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis shrug was so small it could have been interpreted as fidgeting. \"Hey, even a total bastard\u0027s got limits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s changed? Why let the evidence come to light to get you out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why the hell do they do anything? Their spreadsheets or Simms or whatever told them I could do something for them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. Silence fell, broken by the clink of their bottles on the black marble counter. It seemed eerily quiet, here above the city, in this hermetically sealed building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe buzz of the intercom made both of them jump, though McCarthy tried to look nonchalant about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pizza,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept the gun handy anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound McCarthy made at the first bite of pizza was like a man in the throes of - well, ecstasy. \"Oh, God,\" he murmured. \"That\u0027s just...unbelievable. Sorry, but you\u0027ve got no idea how many nights I thought about - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pizza?\" She kept her voice cool and amused. \"I\u0027d imagine there were other things to think about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chewed and swallowed. Gave a Cheshire cat smile. \"Pizza\u0027s the one I\u0027m willing to talk about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Careful, Mr. McCarthy. I\u0027m not on the menu.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No question about that. Shit, I can\u0027t even afford the pizza.\" He blinked, and before she could feel even the first impulse to take offense, said, \"And I didn\u0027t mean that the way it sounded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to laugh, because his expression was priceless. \"Don\u0027t worry. My dignity is hardly that fragile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I meant - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you meant. Enjoy the food.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did, wordlessly, letting out involuntary sounds now and then that strongly reminded her of other things he might have missed, during his time in Ellsworth. Which made her skin prickle and made her pulse thud faster. No. This is strictly dinner. Nothing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was good at self-deception. It was why she had always been so damn good at undercover work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept on watching her, as he made his way through his second beer and last slice of pizza, stealing glances when he thought she wasn\u0027t looking. She felt them like feathery touches on her skin. Her glass was dry; she debated opening another soft drink, then decided to have a beer herself. She went to the refrigerator to pull one free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said flatly, and reached past her to close his hand around hers. She resisted the urge to drive her elbow back into his gut, mainly because the warmth of him, leaning against her, undid all her reflexes. \"You\u0027re on antibiotics. No beer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you, my doctor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Depends,\" he said. He was still pressed against her, his hand hot around hers. \"Do you need examining?\" His voice had dropped to a low, dark-velvet whisper, warm against the back of her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe needed a whole lot of things, and it shocked her, the depth of that need. How long had it been? Nearly a year, she realized, since that business with Dallas that had turned out such a mess. Not a good memory, though the sex...no, even the sex hadn\u0027t been worth that. McCarthy made her body come alive in ways she wasn\u0027t prepared to deal with - nerves hot and tingling, skin tight and sensitive to every touch, every breath he took.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could say no to a lot of things, and a hell of a lot of men. It came to her as an inescapable fact that she simply couldn\u0027t say no to Ben McCarthy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beer bottle slipped back into its place in the door of the refrigerator, and his fingers moved over hers, warm where hers were cold and trembling. Then he traced the sensitive inner side of her arm, his fingertips drawing a line of heat to her elbow, then around. He brushed her hair back in one slow, feather-soft motion, and let out his breath in a sigh that moved, moist and possessive, over her skin, across her throat. She felt her knees going weak. Her pulse pounded torturously fast. I can have this. I deserve this. Just this once. I know it\u0027s not smart. I don\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout any warning, he stepped back. Far back. Cold air crept along her skin, an arctic chill, and she felt the goose-flesh he\u0027d given her for entirely different reasons tighten in response. She shut the fridge door and turned to look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was walking away, his back to her, beer in his hand. Walking to the windows, where he stood staring out at the city lights and swigging beer as if his life depended on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ben...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tipped the bottle up and sucked down the last of the foam, then set the empty down on a table. He picked up the plastic bag that held his personal items.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen his voice sounded, it was rough and abrupt. Hard-edged. \"Do they call cabs, your guys downstairs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can drive you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pressed her hands to the hard marble of the countertop and willed herself - commanded herself - back to some kind of professional demeanor. There was nothing she could do about the rate of her breathing, or the flush in her cheeks, or the dilation of her pupils. But she could ignore it. \"Yes,\" she said. \"Yes, they can call a cab for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Set it up, would you? I need - \" He swallowed convulsively and drew the back of his hand across his mouth. \"I need to pick up my car. It\u0027s getting late. And even though this motel promises to keep the light on, I\u0027d better...\" He was at a loss for words. She could sense the turmoil in him. He made an effort to put some nonchalance back in his voice. \"Besides, I probably have some television viewing to catch up on. Any suggestions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe briefly entertained a few suggestions, but they were anatomically impossible. \"You seem to enjoy baseball.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, love it. Baseball, Mom, apple pie, though come to think of it, I always preferred peach...\" He was rattled, terribly off balance, and she imagined this was something of a new experience for him. She watched him visibly take control. \"You\u0027ve been really kind to a down-and-out ex-con. Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hadn\u0027t been kindness. He knew that, and she wasn\u0027t willing to humiliate herself by pointing it out. \"Any time,\" she said. Her lips felt numb and cold. \"You\u0027ll watch your back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Watch yours. And - \" His eyes met hers, blue and limitless and blind with the same yearning she felt. \"You take care of yourself. You heard the doc. Any fever...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go,\" she said. She didn\u0027t know why, except that she knew he desperately needed her to order him out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded and left, shutting the door behind him. She walked to the intercom and pressed the button and told Marsh her friend was coming down, and would he please call a cab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she went to the couch, turned on the television and sat numbly watching baseball - which she didn\u0027t even like - well into the night, thinking. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-due-red-letter-days-2/page-7.html","bookId":2311,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:16:31 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:16:31 PM"}
