However, she couldn’t look backwards and so she didn’t see how Zhou Weiqing had changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoments earlier, when she had grabbed Zhou Weiqing, his body had finally stopped alternating between those ephemeral flashes of gray light.\u0026nbsp;Behind him appeared a gray figure that was just as tall as he was, and it took a step forwards and merged into his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight at this moment, the Hate Ground No Handle Set on his body changed.\u0026nbsp;Its dark-gold color changed to become a translucent, crystalline gray.\u0026nbsp;His entire aura underwent an utterly earthshaking change as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonely, ancient, cold, remorseless… and boundlessly evil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this instant, Zhou Weiqing’s eyes finally opened.\u0026nbsp;His eyes were filled with that unlimited evil gray, and he himself seemed to be bathed in evil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped forward, moving out from behind Dongfang Hanyue.\u0026nbsp;His body had been completely changed as well.\u0026nbsp;The Dual Legendary Warhammers in his hands had actually transformed into a gray liquid that instantly merged into his arms, while the Yin-Yang Giant Spirit Palms also transformed.\u0026nbsp;The right side transformed into a tiger paw, while the left side transformed into a draconic claw.\u0026nbsp;He had instantly transformed to become much larger.\u0026nbsp;He had actually gone straight into the second mode of the Dragon-Tiger Transformation, ‘Like Dragon Equivalent Tiger’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis right leg still transformed into a hook, but this time it was a completely gray hook.\u0026nbsp;A wave of gray light instantly burst out of his body, transforming him into a gray meteor that smashed straight towards the Terror Sea Dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, he didn’t have the terrifying aura of the Demon God… but when he flew forwards, the Water Attribute energies in his path which had previously stifled him actually melted away on their own, revealing a truly empty ‘tunnel’ in the skies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time Dongfang Hanyue saw him, he had already traversed nearly half the distance to the Terror Sea Dragon.\u0026nbsp;His entire body lashed out in a strange arc, using some sort of simply inconceivable movement to spin around and launch a vicious kick with his right leg against the Terror Sea Dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter entering the ‘Like Dragon Equivalent Tiger’ mode, all of Zhou Weiqing’s physical attributes had increased by a terrifying amount.\u0026nbsp;In this state he was unable to use the vast majority of his techniques, but his physical prowess had risen to an utterly terrifying level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Terror Sea Dragon’s attention had been completely focused on Dongfang Hanyue.\u0026nbsp;Zhou Weiqing’s sudden attack had caught it completely by surprise.\u0026nbsp;However, as a Heavenly God powerhouse it still was able to quickly react with an absolutely explosive level of power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Water atmospheric energies instantly condensed, transforming into many barriers of ice that appeared in front of Zhou Weiqing.\u0026nbsp;At the same instant, the Terror Sea Dragon’s enormous body swiveled violently, sending its thick draconic tail smashing out at Zhou Weiqing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You dare!”\u0026nbsp;Dongfang Hanyue turned pale.\u0026nbsp;She naturally knew just how much power a physical attack from a Heavenly God powerhouse possessed.\u0026nbsp;She poured out the Heavenly Energy from her body, using almost all of the power in her core essence and filling the Dragon Spear with it.\u0026nbsp;The Dragon Spear then shot out like a bolt of red lightning that hurtled towards the Terror Sea Dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blood-red Dragon Spear dramatically increased in size, expanding to become thirty meters long.\u0026nbsp;It hurtled down through the skies like a flash of bloody lightning, carrying an aura of indomitable sharpness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Dongfang Hanyue was just a bit too slow.\u0026nbsp;The red lightning simply couldn’t catch up to Zhou Weiqing’s speed or the Terror Sea Dragon’s attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Terror Sea Dragon chose to steel its resolve. It had to first kill Zhou Weiqing, even if it meant fleeing with heavy wounds. This was the ocean, after all. Without the Tenebrous Sealing Formation, it could leave whenever it wanted and there would be no way Dongfang Hanyue could stop it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe previous Zhou Weiqing would’ve been frozen in midair by the awesome freezing energies.\u0026nbsp;But… the current Zhou Weiqing was clearly in a very strange and marvelous state.\u0026nbsp;When the freezing energies around him touched that blurry layer of gray light, they vanished on their own without being able to impede him in the slightest.\u0026nbsp;Moments later, his attack slammed right into the Terror Sea Dragon’s thick tail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing’s right leg and the Terror Sea Dragon’s draconic tail were on completely different levels of size, but when they collided against each other they actually produced an absolutely shocking explosion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing’s body was blasted away like a cannon ball and sent flying into the air.\u0026nbsp;But… but!\u0026nbsp;Dongfang Hanyue stared wide-eyed at what she saw before her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter blasting Zhou Weiqing away, the Terror Sea Dragon actually froze in its attack pose.\u0026nbsp;Even when the Dragon Spear pierced through its body, leaving behind an enormous gaping wound, it still maintained that frozen pose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoments later, a thunderous explosion rang out yet again.\u0026nbsp;This time, it actually came from the Terror Sea Dragon’s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts thick, powerful draconic tail actually exploded as a fist of gray light blasted it apart, sending blood and flesh flying everywhere.\u0026nbsp;More than a third of its entire tail had been blasted apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA horrified, agonized howl rang out from the Terror Sea Dragon’s maw. Its vast body instantly dove deep into the ocean, not hesitating in the slightest. Protected by an awesome tidal wave, it began to flee for its life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven a Heavenly God powerhouse would suffer heavy injuries when struck by these combined full-strength attacks from Zhou Weiqing and Dongfang Hanyue.\u0026nbsp;Why would this cowardly creature even pause for a second?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDongfang Hanyue flashed over to the midair Zhou Weiqing.\u0026nbsp;She reached out to touch him.\u0026nbsp;By now, the gray aura had completely vanished from his body.\u0026nbsp;Even his Legendary Set had vanished, and his face was as pale as paper, while his aura was almost gone.\u0026nbsp;Beads of blood were dribbling out of his mouth.\u0026nbsp;Thankfully, his heartbeat remained strong and vigorous.\u0026nbsp;Otherwise, Dongfang Hanyue would’ve believed him to be dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding onto his body, she carefully tested pouring her own Heavenly Energy into him.\u0026nbsp;However, she was absolutely shocked by what she found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thirty-six Death Acupuncture Points in his body were slowly swiveling.\u0026nbsp;As soon as her Heavenly Energy entered his body, it was instantly assimilated into Saint Energy.\u0026nbsp;And, judging from his internal condition, Zhou Weiqing’s internal organs and meridians were actually completely unharmed.\u0026nbsp;He was simply suffering from agitated blood and energies.\u0026nbsp;That silver-white energy was constantly roaming his body, protecting it from harm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow did he do this?\u003c/em\u003e Dongfang Hanyue stared at the man in her arms, completely lost. \u003cem\u003eThat strike just now… it had to be just as strong as my own strike with the Tenebrous Dragon Slayer Spear.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026nbsp;What was that gray light?\u003c/em\u003e Even though he was now unconscious, his attack had clearly caused a Heavenly God-stage Heavenly Beast to be injured! What type of level of power had this person reached?!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time Zhou Weiqing slowly woke up, he discovered that he was on a wooden bed.\u0026nbsp;He himself didn’t know how long he had been sleeping for.\u0026nbsp;This seemed to be a very ordinary wooden room, and it actually stank of fish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mental strength restored, the first thing he did was to examine his body. \u003cem\u003eI broke through?\u003c/em\u003e This was Zhou Weiqing’s first reaction. Indeed. The Saint Energy in his body had actually broken through the thirty-eighth stage, and so he was now officially at the second stage of Heavenly Dao Energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt must be understood that after gaining Heavenly Dao Energy, each new stage represented an enormous advance.\u0026nbsp;This was particularly true after the fortieth stage, where each stage represented an entirely different level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been just a few short months, but he had actually broken through yet again.\u0026nbsp;Even though this came at a price of having to face numerous powerful opponents, he was still alive.\u0026nbsp;Being alive was a victory of its own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAs badass as ever!\u003c/em\u003e Zhou Weiqing couldn’t help but smile smugly. He lay there, not even moving. Although his Saint Energy had recovered, his head was killing him. Even trying to think simple thoughts made him feel as though his brain was being stabbed by needles.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-254-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-254-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-26-chapter-254-02","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM"}
