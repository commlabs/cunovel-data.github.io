Someone must be left to work the spice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Count emitted a short, barking laugh. \"You think you can harness the Fremen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There never were enough of them for that,\" the Baron said. \"But the killing has made the rest of my population uneasy. It\u0027s reaching the point where I\u0027m considering another solution to the Arrakeen problem, my dear Fenring. And I must confess the Emperor deserves credit for the inspiration.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah-h-h?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see, Count, I have the Emperor\u0027s prison planet, Salusa Secundus, to inspire me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Count stared at him with glittering intensity. \"What possible connection is there between Arrakis and Salusa Secundus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron felt the alertness in Fenring\u0027s eyes, said: \"No connection yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must admit it\u0027d be a way to develop a substantial work force on Arrakis - use the place as a prison planet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You anticipate an increase in prisoners?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There has been unrest,\" the Baron admitted. \"I\u0027ve had to squeeze rather severely, Fenring. After all, you know the price I paid that damnable Guild to transport our mutual force to Arrakis. That money has to come from somewhere .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suggest you not use Arrakis as a prison planet without the Emperor\u0027s permission, Baron.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not,\" the Baron said, and he wondered at the sudden chill in Fenring\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another matter,\" the Count said. \"We learn that Duke Leto\u0027s Mentat, Thufir Hawat, is not dead but in your employ.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could not bring myself to waste him,\" the Baron said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You lied to our Sardaukar commander when you said Hawat was dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only a white lie, my dear Count. I hadn\u0027t the stomach for a long argument with the man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was Hawat the real traitor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, goodness, no! It was the false doctor.\" The Baron wiped at perspiration on his neck. \"You must understand, Fenring, I was without a Mentat. You know that. I\u0027ve never been without a Mentat. It was most unsettling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could you get Hawat to shift allegiance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His Duke was dead.\" The Baron forced a smile. \"There\u0027s nothing to fear from Hawat, my dear Count. The Mentat\u0027s flesh has been impregnated with a latent poison. We administer an antidote in his meals. Without the antidote, the poison is triggered - he\u0027d die in a few days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Withdraw the antidote,\" the Count said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he\u0027s useful!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he knows too many things no living man should know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said the Emperor doesn\u0027t fear exposure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t play games with me, Baron!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I see such an order above the Imperial seal I\u0027ll obey it,\" the Baron said. \"But I\u0027ll not submit to your whim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think it whim?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else can it be? The Emperor has obligations to me, too, Fenring.

I could place myself on the throne while still beating my breast over how I\u0027d been wronged .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Count\u0027s voice went dry and remote as he said: \"The Emperor believes what his senses tell him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dare the Emperor charge me with treason before a full Landsraad Council?\" And the Baron held his breath with the hope of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Emperor need dare nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron whirled away in his suspensors to hide his expression. It could happen in my lifetime! he thought. Emperor! Let him wrong me! Then - the bribes and coercion, the rallying of the Great Houses: they\u0027d flock to my banner like peasants running for shelter. The thing they fear above all else is the Emperor\u0027s Sardaukar loosed upon them one House at a time .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the Emperor\u0027s sincere hope he\u0027ll never have to charge you with treason,\" the Count said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron found it difficult to keep irony out of his voice and permit only the expression of hurt, but he managed. \"I\u0027ve been a most loyal subject. These words hurt me beyond my capacity to express.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um-m-m-m-ah-hm-m-m,\" said the Count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron kept his back to the Count, nodding. Presently he said, \"It\u0027s time to go to the arena.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed,\" said the Count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey moved out of the cone of silence and, side by side, walked toward the clumps of Houses Minor at the end of the hall. A bell began a slow tolling somewhere in the keep - twenty-minute warning for the arena gathering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Houses Minor wait for you to lead them,\" the Count said, nodding toward the people they approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDouble meaning . . . double meaning , the Baron thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up at the new talismans flanking the exit to his hall - the mounted bull\u0027s head and the oil painting of the Old Duke Atreides, the late Duke Leto\u0027s father. They filled the Baron with an odd sense of foreboding, and he wondered what thoughts these talismans had inspired in the Duke Leto as they hung in the halls of Caladan and then on Arrakis - the bravura father and the head of the bull that had killed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mankind has ah only one mm-m-m science,\" the Count said as they picked up their parade of followers and emerged from the hall into the waiting room - a narrow space with high windows and floor of patterned white and purple tile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what science is that?\" the Baron asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the um-m-m-ah-h science of ah-h-h discontent,\" the Count said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Houses Minor behind them, sheep-faced and responsive, laughed with just the right tone of appreciation, but the sound carried a note of discord as it collided with the sudden blast of motors that came to them when pages threw open the outer doors, revealing the line of ground cars, their guidon pennants whipping in a breeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron raised his voice to surmount the sudden noise, said, \"I hope you\u0027ll not be discontented with the performance of my nephew today, Count Fenring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ah-h-h am filled um-m-m only with a hm-m-m sense of anticipation, yes,\" the Count said. \"Always in the ah-h-h process verbal, one um-m-m ah-h-h must consider the ah-h-h office of origin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron hid his sudden stiffening of surprise by stumbling on the first step down from the exit. Process verbal! That was a report of a crime against the Imperium!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Count chuckled to make it seem a joke, and patted the Baron\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the way to the arena, though, the Baron sat back among the armored cushions of his car, casting covert glances at the Count beside him, wondering why the Emperor\u0027s errand boy had thought it necessary to make that particular kind of joke in front of the Houses Minor. It was obvious that Fenring seldom did anything he felt to be unnecessary, or used two words where one would do, or held himself to a single meaning in a single phrase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were seated in the golden box above the triangular arena - horns blaring, the tiers above and around them jammed with a hubbub of people and waving pennants - when the answer came to the Baron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dear Baron,\" the Count said, leaning close to his ear, \"you know, don\u0027t you, that the Emperor has not given official sanction to your choice of heir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron felt himself to be within a sudden personal cone of silence produced by his own shock. He stared at Fenring, barely seeing the Count\u0027s lady come through the guards beyond to join the party in the golden box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s really why I\u0027m here today,\" the Count said. \"The Emperor wishes me to report on whether you\u0027ve chosen a worthy successor. There\u0027s nothing like the arena to expose the true person from beneath the mask, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Emperor promised me free choice of heir!\" the Baron grated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We shall see,\" Fenring said, and turned away to greet his lady. She sat down, smiling at the Baron, then giving her attention to the sand floor beneath them where Feyd-Rautha was emerging in giles and tights - the black glove and the long knife in his right hand, the white glove and the short knife in his left hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"White for poison, black for purity,\" the Lady Fenring said. \"A curious custom, isn\u0027t it, my love?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um-m-m-m,\" the Count said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe greeting cheer lifted from the family galleries, and Feyd-Rautha paused to accept it, looking up and scanning the faces - seeing his cousines and cousins, the demibrothers, the concubines and out-freyn relations. They were so many pink trumpet mouths yammering amidst a flutter of colorful clothing and banners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came to Feyd-Rautha then that the packed ranks of faces would look just as avidly at his blood as at that of the slave-gladiator. There was not a doubt of the outcome in this fight, of course. Here was only the form of danger without its substance - yet . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyd-Rautha held up his knives to the sun, saluted the three corners of the arena in the ancient manner. The short knife in white-gloved hand (white, the sign of poison) went first into its sheath. Then the long blade in the black-gloved hand - the pure blade that now was unpure, his secret weapon to turn this day into a purely personal victory: poison on the black blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe adjustment of his body shield took only a moment, and he paused to sense the skin-tightening at his forehead assuring him he was properly guarded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis moment carried its own suspense, and Feyd-Rautha dragged it out with the sure hand of a showman, nodding to his handlers and distracters, checking their equipment with a measuring stare - gyves in place with their prickles sharp and glistening, the barbs and hooks waving with their blue streamers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyd-Rautha signaled the musicians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe slow march began, sonorous with its ancient pomp, and Feyd-Rautha led his troupe across the arena for obeisance at the foot of his uncle\u0027s box. He caught the ceremonial key as it was thrown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInto the abrupt silence, he stepped back two paces, raised the key and shouted. \"I dedicate this truth to . . . \" And he paused, knowing his uncle would think: The young fool\u0027s going to dedicate to Lady Fenring after all and cause a ruckus!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" . . . to my uncle and patron, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen!\" Feyd-Rautha shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was delighted to see his uncle sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music resumed at the quick-march, and Feyd-Rautha led his men scampering back across the arena to the prudence door that admitted only those wearing the proper identification band. Feyd-Rautha prided himself that he never used the pru-door and seldom needed distracters. But it was good to know they were available this day - special plans sometimes involved special dangers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, silence settled over the arena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyd-Rautha turned, faced the big red door across from him through which the gladiator would emerge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe special gladiator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plan Thufir Hawat had devised was admirably simple and direct, Feyd-Rautha thought. The slave would not be drugged - that was the danger. Instead, a key word had been drummed into the man\u0027s unconscious to immobilize his muscles at a critical instant. Feyd-Rautha rolled the vital word in his mind, mouthing it without sound: \"Scum!\" To the audience, it would appear that an un-drugged slave had been slipped into the arena to kill the na-Baron. And all the carefully arranged evidence would point to the slavemaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA low humming arose from the red door\u0027s servomotors as they were armed for opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyd-Rautha focused all his awareness on the door. This first moment was the critical one. The appearance of the gladiator as he emerged told the trained eye much it needed to know. All gladiators were supposed to be hyped on elacca drug to come out kill-ready in fighting stance - but you had to watch how they hefted the knife, which way they turned in defense, whether they were actually aware of the audience in the stands. The way a slave cocked his head could give the most vital clue to counter and feint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red door slammed open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut charged a tall, muscular man with shaved head and darkly pitted eyes. His skin was carrot-colored as it should be from the elacca drug, but Feyd-Rautha knew the color was paint. The slave wore green leotards and the red belt of a semishield - the belt\u0027s arrow pointing left to indicate the slave\u0027s left side was shielded. He held his knife sword-fashion, cocked slightly outward in the stance of a trained fighter. Slowly, he advanced into the arena, turning his shielded side toward Feyd-Rautha and the group at the pru-door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like not the look of this one, \"said one of Feyd-Rautha\u0027s barb-men. \"Are you sure he\u0027s drugged, m\u0027Lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has the color,\" Feyd-Rautha said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet he stands like a fighter,\" said another helper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyd-Rautha advanced two steps onto the sand, studied this slave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What has he done to his arm?\" asked one of the distracters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyd-Rautha\u0027s attention went to a bloody scratch on the man\u0027s left forearm, followed the arm down to the hand as it pointed to a design drawn in blood on the left hip of the green leotards - a wet shape there: the formalized outline of a hawk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHawk!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyd-Rautha looked up into the darkly pitted eyes, saw them glaring at him with uncommon alertness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s one of Duke Leto\u0027s fighting men we took on Arrakis! Feyd-Rautha thought. No simple gladiator this! A chill ran through him, and he wondered if Hawat had another plan for this arena - a feint within a feint within a feint. And only the slavemaster prepared to take the blame!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyd-Rautha\u0027s chief handler spoke at his ear: \"I like not the look on that one, m\u0027Lord. Let me set a barb or two in his knife arm to try him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll set my own barbs,\" Feyd-Rautha said. He took a pair of the long, hooked shafts from the handler, hefted them, testing the balance. These barbs, too, were supposed to be drugged - but not this time, and the chief handler might die because of that. But it was all part of the plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll come out of this a hero ,\" Hawat had said. \"Killed your gladiator man to man and in spite of treachery. The slavemaster will be executed and your man will step into his spot .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyd-Rautha advanced another five paces into the arena, playing out the moment, studying the slave. Already, he knew, the experts in the stands above him were aware that something was wrong. The gladiator had the correct skin color for a drugged man, but he stood his ground and did not tremble. The aficionados would be whispering among themselves now: \"See how he stands. He should be agitated - attacking or retreating. See how he conserves his strength, how he waits. He should not wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyd-Rautha felt his own excitement kindle. Let there be treachery in Hawat\u0027s mind , he thought. I can handle this slave. And it\u0027s my long knife that carries the poison this time, not the short one. Even Hawat doesn\u0027t know that .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hai, Harkonnen!\" the slave called. \"Are you prepared to die?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeathly stillness gripped the arena. Slaves did not issue the challenge!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, Feyd-Rautha had a clear view of the gladiator\u0027s eyes, saw the cold ferocity of despair in them. He marked the way the man stood, loose and ready, muscles prepared for victory. The slave grapevine had carried Hawat\u0027s message to this one: \"You\u0027ll get a true chance to kill the na-Baron .\" That much of the scheme was as they\u0027d planned it, then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tight smile crossed Feyd-Rautha\u0027s mouth. He lifted the barbs, seeing success for his plans in the way the gladiator stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hai! Hai!\" the slave challenged, and crept forward two steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one in the galleries can mistake it now , Feyd-Rautha thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis slave should have been partly crippled by drug-induced terror. Every movement should have betrayed his inner knowledge that there was no hope for him - he could not win. He should have been filled with the stories of the poisons the na-Baron chose for the blade in his white-gloved hand. The na-Baron never gave quick death; he delighted in demonstrating rare poisons, could stand in the arena pointing out interesting side effects on a writhing victim. There was fear in the slave, yes - but not terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyd-Rautha lifted the barbs high, nodded in an almost-greeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gladiator pounced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis feint and defensive counter were as good as any Feyd-Rautha had ever seen. A timed side blow missed by the barest fraction from severing the tendons of the na-Baron\u0027s left leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyd-Rautha danced away, leaving a barbed shaft in the slave\u0027s right forearm, the hooks completely buried in flesh where the man could not withdraw them without ripping tendons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA concerted gasp lifted from the galleries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound filled Feyd-Rautha with elation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew now what his uncle was experiencing, sitting up there with the Fenrings, the observers from the Imperial Court , beside him. There could be no interference with this fight. The forms must be observed in front of witnesses. And the Baron would interpret the events in the arena only one way - threat to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe slave backed, holding knife in teeth and lashing the barbed shaft to his arm with the pennant. \"I do not feel your needle!\" he shouted. Again he crept forward, knife ready, left side presented, his body bent backward to give it the greatest surface of protection from the half-shield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat action, too, didn\u0027t escape the galleries. Sharp cries came from the family boxes. Feyd-Rautha\u0027s handlers were calling out to ask if he needed them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved them back to the pru-door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll give them a show such as they\u0027ve never had before , Feyd-Rautha thought. No tame killing where they can sit back and admire the style. This\u0027ll be something to take them by the guts and twist them. When I\u0027m Baron they\u0027ll remember this day and won\u0027t be a one of them can escape fear of me because of this day .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyd-Rautha gave ground slowly before the gladiator\u0027s crablike advance. Arena sand grated underfoot. He heard the slave\u0027s panting, smelled his own sweat and a faint odor of blood on the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteadily, the na-Baron moved backward, turning to the right, his second barb ready. The slave danced sideways. Feyd-Rautha appeared to stumble, heard the scream from the galleries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, the slave pounced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGods, what a fighting man! Feyd-Rautha thought as he leaped aside. Only youth\u0027s quickness saved him, but he left the second barb buried in the deltoid muscle of the slave\u0027s right arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShrill cheers rained from the galleries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey cheer me now , Feyd-Rautha thought. He heard the wildness in the voices just as Hawat had said he would. They\u0027d never cheered a family fighter that way before. And he thought with an edge of grimness on a thing Hawat had told him: \"It\u0027s easier to be terrified by an enemy you admire .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwiftly, Feyd-Rautha retreated to the center of the arena where all could see clearly. He drew his long blade, crouched and waited for the advancing slave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man took only the time to lash the second barb tight to his arm, then sped in pursuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet the family see me do this thing , Feyd-Rautha thought. I am their enemy: let them think of me as they see me now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew his short blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not fear you, Harkonnen swine,\" the gladiator said. \"Your tortures cannot hurt a dead man. I can be dead on my own blade before a handler lays finger to my flesh. And I\u0027ll have you dead beside me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyd-Rautha grinned, offered now the long blade, the one with the poison. \"Try this one,\" he said, and feinted with the short blade in his other hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe slave shifted knife hands, turned inside both parry and feint to grapple the na-Baron\u0027s short blade - the one in the white gloved hand that tradition said should carry the poison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will die, Harkonnen,\" the gladiator gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey struggled sideways across the sand. Where Feyd-Rautha\u0027s shield met the slave\u0027s halfshield, a blue glow marked the contact. The air around them filled with ozone from the field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Die on your own poison!\" the slave grated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began forcing the white-gloved hand inward, turning the blade he thought carried the poison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet them see this! Feyd-Rautha thought. He brought down the long blade, felt it clang uselessly against the barbed shaft lashed to the slave\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyd-Rautha felt a moment of desperation. He had not thought the barbed shafts would be an advantage for the slave. But they gave the man another shield. And the strength of this gladiator! The short blade was being forced inward inexorably, and Feyd-Rautha focused on the fact that a man could also die on an unpoisoned blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scum!\" Feyd-Rautha gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the key word, the gladiator\u0027s muscles obeyed with a momentary slackness. It was enough for Feyd-Rautha. He opened a space between them sufficient for the long blade. Its poisoned tip flicked out, drew a red line down the slave\u0027s chest. There was instant agony in the poison. The man disengaged himself, staggered backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, let my dear family watch , Feyd-Rautha thought. Let them think on this slave who tried to turn the knife he thought poisoned and use it against me. Let them wonder how a gladiator could come into this arena ready for such an attempt. And let them always be aware they cannot know for sure which of my hands carries the poison .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyd-Rautha stood in silence, watching the slowed motions of the slave. The man moved within a hesitation-awareness. There was an orthographic thing on his face now for every watcher to recognize. The death was written there. The slave knew it had been done to him and he knew how it had been done. The wrong blade had carried the poison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You!\" the man moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyd-Rautha drew back to give death its space. The paralyzing drug in the poison had yet to take full effect, but the man\u0027s slowness told of its advance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe slave staggered forward as though drawn by a string - one dragging step at a time. Each step was the only step in his universe. He still clutched his knife, but its point wavered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One day . . . one . . . of us . . . will . . . get . . . you,\" he gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sad little moue contorted his mouth. He sat, sagged, then stiffened and rolled away from Feyd-Rautha, face down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyd-Rautha advanced in the silent arena, put a toe under the gladiator and rolled him onto his back to give the galleries a clear view of the face when the poison began its twisting, wrenching work on the muscles. But the gladiator came over with his own knife, protruding from his breast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of frustration, there was for Feyd-Rautha a measure of admiration for the effort this slave had managed in overcoming the paralysis to do this thing to himself. With the admiration came the realization that here was truly a thing to fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat which makes a man superhuman is terrifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he focused on this thought, Feyd-Rautha became conscious of the eruption of noise from the stands and galleries around him. They were cheering with utter abandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyd-Rautha turned, looking up at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll were cheering except the Baron, who sat with hand to chin in deep contemplation - and the Count and his lady, both of whom were staring down at him, their faces masked by smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCount Fenring turned to his lady, said: \"Ah-h-h-um-m-m, a resourceful um-m-m-m young man. Eh, mm-m-m-ah, my dear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His ah-h-h synaptic responses are very swift,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron looked at her, at the Count, returned his attention to the arena, thinking: If someone could get that close to one of mine! Rage began to replace his fear. I\u0027ll have the slavemaster dead over a slow fire this night . . . and if this Count and his lady had a hand in it . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe conversation in the Baron\u0027s box was remote movement to Feyd-Rautha, the voices drowned in the foot-stamping chant that came now from all around:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Head! Head! Head! Head!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron scowled, seeing the way Feyd-Rautha turned to him. Languidly, controlling his rage with difficulty, the Baron waved his hand toward the young man standing in the arena beside the sprawled body of the slave. Give the boy a head. He earned it by exposing the slavemaster .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyd-Rautha saw the signal of agreement, thought: They think they honor me. Let them see what I think!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw his handlers approaching with a saw-knife to do the honors, waved them back, repeated the gesture as they hesitated. They think they honor me with just a head! he thought. He bent and crossed the gladiator\u0027s hands around the protruding knife handle, then removed the knife and placed it in the limp hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was done in an instant, and he straightened, beckoned his handlers. \"Bury this slave intact with his knife in his hands,\" he said. \"The man earned it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the golden box, Count Fenring leaned close to the Baron, said: \"A grand gesture, that - true bravura. Your nephew has style as well as courage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He insults the crowd by refusing the head,\" the Baron muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all,\" Lady Fenring said. She turned, looking up at the tiers around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the Baron noted the line of her neck - a truly lovely flowing of muscles - like a young boy\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They like what your nephew did,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the import of Feyd-Rautha\u0027s gesture penetrated to the most distant seats, as the people saw the handlers carrying off the dead gladiator intact, the Baron watched them and realized she had interpreted the reaction correctly. The people were going wild, beating on each other, screaming and stamping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron spoke wearily. \"I shall have to order a fete. You cannot send people home like this, their energies unspent. They must see that I share their elation.\" He gave a hand signal to his guard, and a servant above them dipped the Harkonnen orange pennant over the box - once, twice, three times - signal for a fete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeyd-Rautha crossed the arena to stand beneath the golden box, his weapons sheathed, arms hanging at his sides. Above the undiminished frenzy of the crowd, he called: \"A fete, Uncle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe noise began to subside as people saw the conversation and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In your honor, Feyd!\" the Baron called down. And again, he caused the pennant to be dipped in signal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the arena, the pru-barriers had been dropped and young men were leaping down into the arena, racing toward Feyd-Rautha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ordered the pru-shields dropped. Baron?\" the Count asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one will harm the lad,\" the Baron said. \"He\u0027s a hero.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first of the charging mass reached Feyd-Rautha, lifted him on their shoulders, began parading around the arena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He could walk unarmed and unshielded through the poorest quarters of Harko tonight,\" the Baron said. \"They\u0027d give him the last of their food and drink just for his company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Baron pushed himself from his chair, settled his weight into his suspensors. \"You will forgive me, please. There are matters that require my immediate attention. The guard will see you to the keep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Count arose, bowed. \"Certainly, Baron. We\u0027re looking forward to the fete. I\u0027ve ah-h-h-mm-m-m never seen a Harkonnen fete.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" the Baron said. \"The fete.\" He turned, was enveloped by guards as he stepped into the private exit from the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA guard captain bowed to Count Fenring. \"Your orders, my Lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will ah-h-h wait for the worst mm-m-m crush to um-m-m pass,\" the Count said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, m\u0027Lord.\" The man bowed himself back three paces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCount Fenring faced his lady, spoke again in their personal humming-code tongue: \"You saw it, of course?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the same humming tongue, she said: \"The lad knew the gladiator wouldn\u0027t be drugged.

Someone sighed. Paul looked for Chani, found that she had left his side. He was hemmed in by a press of robed bodies. Someone jostled him, said, \"Excuse me, Usul. What a crush! It\u0027s always this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn his left, the narrow bearded face of the one called Farok turned toward Paul.

The odor of the place assailed him: unwashed bodies, distillate esters of reclaimed wastes, everywhere the sour effluvia of humanity with, over it all, a turbulence of spice and spicelike harmonics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are we waiting, Farok?\" Paul asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For the Reverend Mother, I think.

Then Liet-Kynes is dead , he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was Harkonnen treachery,\" someone hissed. \"They made it seem an accident . . . lost in the desert . . . a \u0027thopter crash . . . \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul felt a burst of anger. The man who had befriended them, helped save them from the Harkonnen hunters, the man who had sent his Fremen cohorts searching for two strays in the desert . . . another victim of the Harkonnens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does Usul hunger yet for revenge?\" Farok asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Paul could answer, there came a low call and the troop swept forward into a wider chamber, carrying Paul with them. He found himself in an open space confronted by Stilgar and a strange woman wearing a flowing wraparound garment of brilliant orange and green. Her arms were bare to the shoulders, and he could see she wore no stillsuit. Her skin was a pale olive. Dark hair swept back from her high forehead, throwing emphasis on sharp cheekbones and aquiline nose between the dense darkness of her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned toward him, and Paul saw golden rings threaded with water tallies dangling from her ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This bested my Jamis?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be silent, Harah,\" Stilgar said. \"It was Jamis\u0027 doing - he invoked the tahaddi al-burhan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not but a boy!\" she said. She gave her head a sharp shake from side to side, setting the water tallies to jingling. \"My children made fatherless by another child? Surely, \u0027twas an accident!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Usul, how many years have you?\" Stilgar asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fifteen standard,\" Paul said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar swept his eyes over the troop. \"Is there one among you cares to challenge me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar looked at the woman. \"Until I\u0027ve learned his weirding ways. I\u0027d not challenge him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe returned his stare. \"But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You saw the stranger, woman who went with Chani to the Reverend Mother?\" Stilgar asked. \"She\u0027s an out-freyn Sayyadina, mother to this lad. The mother and son are masters of the weirding ways of battle.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dune-dune-chronicles-1/page-21.html","bookId":2153,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:23:42 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:23:42 PM"}
