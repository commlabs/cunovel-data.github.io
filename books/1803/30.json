Propping her chin on her linked fingers, she\u0027d regarded him down the length of the dining table and asked, \"In April, when everyone of importance gathers in London for the Season and remains until June, what do people do with their children?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They stay in the country with their nannies, governesses, and tutors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the same is true in the autumn during the Little Season?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Stephen nodded, she tipped her head to the side and said gravely, \"How lonely English children must be during those long months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They aren\u0027t alone,\" Stephen emphasized patiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Loneliness has nothing to do with being alone. Not for children or adults.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephen was so desperate to avert a topic that he feared would lead directly into an impossible discussion of their children, that he didn\u0027t realize his tone had chilled or that in her vulnerable state, his remarks might hit her like daggers. \"Are you speaking from experience?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I… don\u0027t know,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid that tomorrow evening, you\u0027re going to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he nodded, she looked quickly at the delicate pastry shell filled with pâté that was on the plate in front of her, then she drew a deep breath, as if gathering her courage, and looked at him directly. \"Are you going out because of what I just said?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt like a beast for making her ask that, and very emphatically he said, \"I have a prior engagement that cannot be cancelled.\" And then, as if his need to exonerate himself in her eyes weren\u0027t already reaching the absurd, he announced, \"It may also set your mind at ease to know that my parents had my brother and me brought to London at least once every fortnight during the London Season. My brother and his wife, and a few of their friends, bring their children and an entourage of governesses here during the Season.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s lovely!\" she exclaimed, her smile dawning like the sun. \"I am vastly relieved to know there are such devoted parents amongst the ton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most of the ton,\" he informed her dryly, \"is vastly amused by that same parental devotion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think one ought to let the opinions of others influence what one does, do you?\" she asked, frowning a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree things hit Stephen at once, and he was torn between laughter, pity, and chagrin: Whether she realized it or not, Charise Lancaster was \"interviewing\" him, weighing his merits, not only as a prospective husband, but as the prospective father of her children—neither of which were roles he was going to fulfill. And that was a very good thing, because in the first place, he didn\u0027t seem to be rating very high in her estimation, and in the second, her disinterest in the opinions of Others would surely get her banished from polite society within a week, were she ever to set foot in it. Stephen had never cared for anyone\u0027s opinion, but then he was a man, not a woman, and his wealth and illustrious name gave him the right to do as he damn well pleased and to do it with impunity. Unfortunately, the same upright society matrons who were eager to lure him into marrying their daughters, and who were perfectly willing to overlook any of his vices and excesses, would pillory Charise Lancaster for the most minor social infraction—let alone a major one such as dining alone with him, as she was doing now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think one ought to let the opinions of others influence one\u0027s actions?\" she repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, definitely not,\" he solemnly averred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m happy to hear that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was afraid you would be,\" Stephen said, biting back a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis good humor continued unabated during their meal and afterward in the drawing room, but when it was time to bid her good-night, he realized he couldn\u0027t trust himself to do more than press a brotherly kiss on her cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever you did, it certainly has turned the trick,\" Hugh Whitticomb announced early the following evening, as he poked his head into the drawing room, where Stephen was waiting for Sherry to join him for dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s feeling well, then?\" Stephen replied, pleased and relieved that his passionate and willing \"fiancée\" had not decided to indulge in a fit of virginal guilt over the few liberties he\u0027d taken the night before and confessed it all to Whitticomb. Stephen had been closeted all day, first with one of his stewards, and then with the architect who was laboring over the plans for renovating one of his estates, and so he hadn\u0027t caught a glimpse of her, though the servants had kept him informed of her whereabouts in the large townhouse and reported that she appeared to be in good spirits. He was looking forward to a thoroughly enjoyable evening, first with Sherry and later with Helene. As to which part of the evening he was most looking forward to, that was something he did not care to consider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s feeling more than well,\" the physician remarked. \"I\u0027d say she\u0027s glowing. She said to tell you she\u0027d be down in a moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephen\u0027s pleasurable contemplation of his evening was substantially diminished by the fact that the physician was now strolling into the room, uninvited—and unwanted—and he was studying Stephen with an open, intense interest that was distinctly disturbing from someone as astute as he. \"What did you do to accomplish such a miraculous transformation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did as you suggested,\" Stephen said mildly, turning and walking over to the fireplace mantel where he\u0027d left his glass of sherry. \"I made her feel… er… safe and secure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you be more specific? My colleagues—the ones I\u0027ve consulted about Miss Lancaster\u0027s amnesia—would surely be interested in your method of treatment. It\u0027s amazingly effective.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn answer, Stephen propped an elbow on the mantelpiece and quirked a mocking brow at the inquisitive physician. \"Don\u0027t let me keep you from another appointment,\" he countered dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe broad hint that he should leave led Hugh Whitticomb to conclude that Stephen wished to enjoy the evening alone with her. Either that or he simply didn\u0027t want a witness to the charade he was being forced to play as her devoted fiancé. Hoping to discover it was the former, he said sociably, \"As it happens, I\u0027m free for the evening. Perhaps I could join you at supper and witness firsthand your methods with Miss Lancaster?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/until-you-westmoreland-saga-3/page-30.html","bookId":1803,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:38 PM"}
