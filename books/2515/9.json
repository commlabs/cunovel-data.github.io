Dante knows a tremen?dous amount of Roman and Greek history and my?thology. He is much more educated than I would have guessed. I begin to understand that one of the reasons Landulf kept him around was because of his powerful story-telling abilities. Even the evil duke loved a good tale, and when Dante starts on a story, his whole demeanor changes, as if he were hypnotized, and he speaks with great eloquence. But the moment the tale is over, he reverts. The sudden personality changes are disconcerting, but I am sympathetic to him be?cause he has obviously been warped by his exposure to Landulf. I feel guilty that I am manipulating him further. Only by dominating him with my eyes, by soothing him several times a day, am I able to persuade him to lead the way to the castle. The thought of the place fills him with dread and he must be wondering that his legs continue to carry him in that direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet he doesn\u0027t seem to wonder about me. His affection for me is genuine; it pains me to use him so. And it is obvious that he is more concerned about me than about himself. When my influence on him wanes, he begs me to turn back. The human sacrifices he tells me about as being commonplace at the castle fill me with doubt. It is hard to believe there could exist such evil as he describes. Of course that is Dante\u0027s point. Landulf is no longer human. He has become a beast he invoked. The devil lives and breathes on a peak once considered sacred in ancient Rome. Before resting each night, Dante recites the entire mass in Latin, praying to a small copper cross he hides during the day in the wooden brace that supports his leper\u0027s stump. At night I see him scratching at his sores, and his suffering weighs on my heart. Only a devil, I think, could have cursed him so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet I still do not believe in his Christian demons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what draws me to meet Landulf is the chance to witness his magic, whether it be white or black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough I know for a fact it will be black, that I have visited the cruel wizard already. But what I remember of the future grows more abstract with each passing day. The dirt paths of old Sicily are my only guides. I remember Alanda\u0027s name but I cannot imagine her face. At night, though, I stare for hours at the stars, trying to convince myself that I was once there, in a mysterious ship, with creatures from another world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd perhaps with the gods of ancient myths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDante wants to tell me about Perseus as we walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am familiar with the mythology, of course, having lived in ancient Greece for many years. But Dante insists I have not heard it properly, and it seems to be one of his favorite stories, so I let him speak. But talking as he walks is a luxury Dante can ill afford. Often he must stop to lean on me for support, but now he is remarkably energetic. He has found a stout walking stick that helps him walk as he speaks with loving enthusiasm about the ancient hero. Obviously Dante worships such characters, and wishes he were one, instead of the crippled leper he is. A handsome young god who could sweep away a beautiful princess such as me. I know Dante is more than a little in love with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perseus was the son of Zeus and Danae. His grandfather was Acrisius, a cruel king, who visited the oracle at Delphi and learned that his daughter\u0027s child was destined to be the instrument of his death. Perseus and his mother were therefore locked in a chest and set adrift on the ocean. The chest floated to Seriphus, where it was found by a fisherman and brought to the king of the land, Polydectes, a generous man who received them with love. When Perseus had become a young man, Polydectes sent him to destroy the Medusa, a terrible monster that was laying waste to his land and turning men to stone. History has it that Medusa had once been a beautiful maiden whose hair was her chief glory. But she dared to compare herself to Athena, and in revenge the goddess changed her wonderful curls into hissing snakes and she became a monster,\" Dante pauses. \"But that\u0027s not what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to smile It is only a story. \"What really happened, my friend?\" I ask, a mock?ing note in my voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDante is not dissuaded. \"The Medusa never com?pared herself to anyone. She thought she was beyond comparison, beyond all the gods and goddesses. It was only her hair that became monstrous--her face remained beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh. \"That is good to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is an important point. One never knows if it was her beauty or the serpents on her head that were able to turn men and other creatures to stone. But I must continue with the tale. Perseus, given a divine shield by Athena, and winged shoes by Hermes, approached Medusa\u0027s cave while the monster slept, Perseus took special care not to look directly at her. All around him in the cavern were the stone figures of men and women and animals who had chanced to gaze at the evil creature. Guided only by the Medusa\u0027s image reflected in his bright shield, he cut off her head and ended the threat of the monster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then he gave the head to Athena?\" I knew the end, I thought. Dante shook his head and spoke seriously. \"That is not true. He kept it for himself. It was with the Medusa\u0027s head that he was able to defeat Atlas, and steal the gods\u0027 golden apples. It was only with the Medusa\u0027s head that he was able to turn to stone the Titan that was threatening to eat Andromeda, who would later become his wife.\" Dante shook his head again \"Perseus never gave up the severed head of the Gorgon. It was too valuable a weapon.\" I continue to smile, even though I know we draw close to Landulf s castle. The forest has changed, become wilder and darker, filled with trees that have twisted arms for branches, sharp nails for leaves. A gloom hangs over the land and it depresses even me, me who is usually not affected by subtle elemental vibrations. Even the sun\u0027s rays are dimmed by a gray overcast that appears made more of dust than water vapor. There is a constant odor of smoke, and I believe I detect the stench of burnt bodies. Still, I think I am an invincible vampire, no easy victim for Landulf and his black sorcery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is only one version of the story,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDante regards me with disappointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is the correct version, my lady,\" he says. \"It is an important story. Hidden within it are many great truths.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will have to explain them to me another time.\" I pause and survey the land ahead. We are in rugged mountains made of hard rock and dry river?beds. In the distance hangs a black mist that even my supernatural vision cannot pierce. This unnatural cloud clings to some kind of massive stone structure, but I cannot discern the details. I point and ask, \"What is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDante is suddenly the cowering fool again. He clings to my arm and the fluid from his open sores stains my white shirt. \"It is our death, my lady. There is still time to turn back. Before his thralls come for us in the black of night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are his thralls?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDante speaks in a frightened whisper. \"Men who have no hearts, and yet still live. I swear to you I have seen these creatures. They see without eyes and have no need to breathe fresh air.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many men does Landulf have at his com?mand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDante is animated. \"You don\u0027t understand, my lady. His power is not in strength of arms. Had he not one man, he could still hold off the full might of Rome, and the Moslems for that matter. Even they fear him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grip Dante\u0027s shoulders. \"Tell me how many men he has under his command. Even an estimate will help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDante is having trouble catching his breath. \"I never counted them. It must be several hundred.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two hundred? Eight hundred?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDante coughs. \"Maybe five hundred. But they are not important. It is the spirits that haunt this land that will kill us. They are in the trees, the rocks--he sends them out to spy on those who dare to challenge him. He must already know we are here. We have to go back!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am gentle, but I do hold his eye. \"Dante, my friend, you have done me a great service. I know you didn\u0027t want to come here but you have. And I know it was out of love and respect for me. But now you have repaid your debt to me. You are free to return the way you have come. I want you to return to Messina, and save yourself. There is no need for you to go any farther along this road.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my surprise, my power over him is outweighed by his love for me. He shakes his head and pleads with me. \"You do not know what he will do to you. He has powers you cannot imagine. A lust for cruelty and pain that cannot be spoken. He rips the eyes from his victims and stores them in jars to later feed to caged rats he keeps in his personal quarters. He pulls the bones from slaves before their very eyes and munches on them at gruesome suppers. All this he does to set the stage for his satanic invocations. But when the spirits come, there is nowhere to hide.\" Dante weeps and grips my arm fiercely. \"Please don\u0027t go there, my lady! In God\u0027s holy name I beg you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kiss him, stroke his face, and then shake my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must go,\" I say. \"But I will go in the name of your God, if it comforts you, and the name of my God as well. Wish me luck, my dear Dante, and take care of yourself. You are a precious soul, and I have known so few in my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is in despair. \"My lady?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goodbye. Do not worry about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn and walk deeper into the gloom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do not hear him follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet all around me darkness deepens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun still shines. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/creatures-of-forever-the-last-vampire-6/page-9.html","bookId":2515,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:19:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:19:09 PM"}
