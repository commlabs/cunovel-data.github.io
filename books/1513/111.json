Target stats: Strength: 18, Agility: 15, Vitality: 20, Spiritual force: 22.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbilities - 1. Scales Defence: The Black Horrall Snake rhombus scales has a defensive force field encircling it at all times. Immune to physical and magical attacks under 5 degrees. Moreover, it has a huge negation towards attack of 5 degrees and more. 2. Shadow Stealth: Inheriting the Kemoyin Serpent’s shadow powers allows the Black Horrall Snake to enter into a stealth state anytime, withdrawing all signs of energy waves. 3. Lightning blaze: Emits a lightning flame from the horn. Estimated degree of attack: 12 to 15 degrees. Status: Extremely weak!]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stats like this…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin’s eyes widened, “It has long since surpassed the boundaries of a level 3 acolyte, and is most likely close to that of an official Magus?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no records of the stats of official Magus in the A.I. Chip, so Leylin could only guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Roth, careful! This is a Black Horrall Snake! Its might is extremely higher, much higher than your imagination!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hisssssss!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Leylin had finished warning him, the Black Horrall Snake let out an ear-piercing hiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe massive body of the Black Horrall Snake began to writhe and the tail was sent flailing. The cave seemed to shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* Pa Pa! * The milky white tentacles broke constantly, and from its wounds, there was white dense pus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe triangular pupils of the Black Horrall Snake seemed to reveal a glint of ridicule. Following which, it turned back into the eyes of a beast and bit on Roth who had fallen to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Save him!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaya and Jayden roared, and a few green vines and silver flying knives was sent flying towards the Black Horrall Snake’s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* Bang! * The flying knives and vines hit on the scales of the Black Horrall Snake, and sparks were created.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Black Horrall Snake did not budge at all and opened its bloody mouth, directly chomping on Roth, swallowing him with a gulp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, no!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the neck of the giant snake, there was a bulge as if someone was attacking within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery soon, the bulge entered the stomach of the snake and the struggle within grew smaller and smaller, finally turning still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole process took only a few seconds, so fast that Leylin and the others did not have time to rescue him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Black Horrall Snake?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBosain who was on the side recovered from the shock, “Isn\u0027t that an existence that, when matured, could deal with a rank 3 Magus? Why has it appeared here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It could go against a rank 3 Magus?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJayden and the others jumped in shock! rank 3 Magus! That is the cultivation of the leader in the Lighthouse of the Night, a person who could suppress the 3 academies!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If it’s a rank 3 Magus, we would have long been dead, not even a speck left. Could it be that this Black Horrall Snake has not matured yet?” Leylin’s thoughts spun rapidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No! It’s not correct! This is a matured Black Horrall Snake. However, due to the duration that it has been sealed for and not being able to eat, it has already regressed from a rank 3 Magus into an elementary rank 1 Magus! Furthermore, it was awakened by the human boy earlier…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the indication from the A.I. Chip, Leylin guessed the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis Black Horrall Snake could be the byproduct of the great Magus Serholm before, and was left here according to his wishes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was most likely no food in this secret plane, hence, the Black Horrall Snake could only hibernate to reduce the consumption needed for its body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, hundreds and thousands of years have passed. Even if the Black Horrall Snake tried to conserve its strength, it could not have reversed the decomposition effect. From originally a creature which could go against a rank 3 Magus, it had now regressed to the standard of a rank 1 Magus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter swallowing Roth, Black Horrall Snake’s pupils showed a hint of satisfaction, before sizing up Leylin and the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is still a young Black Horrall Snake, not even an official Magus. We still have a chance!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin was afraid that Jayden and the rest would have been dismayed and lost their fighting spirit after hearing declare it as a ‘rank 3 Magus’, hence, he quickly shouted to boost their confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin had the A.I. Chip and was able to tell the truth behind the regression of the snake. Such a thing had to be kept mum. In the short period of time Jayden and the rest wouldn\u0027t be able to discover it, so Leylin just simply told a lie in its place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A fledgling?” Bosain’s eyes flashed. “Indeed! This Black Horrall Snake is too weak, even weaker than a rank 1 Magus. It is definitely in its pre-adolescent phase!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is a creature which could fight against rank 3 Magi in the future when it grows up! If I were to sign a contract with it…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBosain muttered and his armour immediately flashed. A metal liquid was held in his right hand, turning into a silver white sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come! The brutal Black Horrall Snake of the legends! Let me, Bosain, be your owner!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBosain eyes were frenzied and he directly charged forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* Bang! * The thin silver sword slashed at the Black Horrall Snake’s scales, creating a long gash. A few palm sized scales too dropped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Indeed, it if were a matured Black Horrall Snake, I would have no chances at all to break its defensive forcefield!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBosain hollered, “This is mine! This Black Horrall Snake must definitely belong to me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hisssssssss!” The Black Horrall Snake hissed angrily and flung its tail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* Bang! * As if it were a black lightning, the long tail viciously struck Bosain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBosain seemed to fly out like a cannonball, creating a large hole in the walls of the cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* Hua La La! * Mud and rocks fell down, revealing Bosain who was wearing his shining white armour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leylin, Jayden, and Shaya, help me to restrain it. Not only can you get the friendship of the Lilytell family, I am also willing to give up all of the rewards obtained during this exploration!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBosain shook his head and finally recovered from the dizziness, seeking help from Leylin and the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No matter what, let us restrain this Black Horrall Snake first. If not, we won\u0027t have a chance to obtain anything!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJayden spoke as he channeled a large amount of spiritual force and magic power into the green badge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRipples of jade green colour continuously came from the badge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Peng!* Countless jade green vines seemed to fill the cave as it tried to entangle the Black Horrall Snake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cloud of Afterlife!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin too used his spell that he was proud of. A large murky green cloud immediately engulfed the Black Horrall Snake within, the corrosive sounds constantly emitting from within the mist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Comb of Vengeful Spirit!” Shaya too took out her prized magic artifact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had the appearance of a rather old wooden comb. Shaya immediately used it to comb her fire red beautiful hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Sssii!*! The fire red hair grew rapidly. In the blink of an eye, there was already a layer of hair on the ground. After which, the ground of the whole cave was dyed red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is actually a type of binding type magic artifact. Combined with Jayden’s green badge, it may really even restrain this Black Horrall Snake!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn expectant look flashed across Leylin’s eyes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the dark green Cloud of Afterlife had dissipated, it revealed the massive Black Horrall Snake’s figure within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scales were still gleaming, as usual, only that in that large gash that Bosain had left on its body, the surrounding flesh had been corroded to a purple black state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe huge snake’s eyes seemed dispirited. Looking at it, it was evident that Leylin’s attack had some effect on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All together!” Jayden nodded his head towards Shaya. Countless green vines from midair wrapped around the Black Horrall Snake, even around its head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the innumerable fire red hair on the ground was like steel net. Very soon it wrapped itself like a net, trapping the Black Horrall Snake within.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Bang!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe green vines and red hair continuously tightened, leaving circles after circles of red and green imprints on the Black Horrall Snake’s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe huge snake lost its balance and fell to the ground, bringing up dust and rock shards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nice one!” Bosain praised them. His body in midair left several white afterimages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few jumps, he came to the top of the Black Horrall Snake’s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little baby, you’re mine now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smug and zealous expression filled Bosain’s face. He immediately withdrew a scroll which emitted immense energy waves, directly at the Black Horrall Snake’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is... A sealing contract within a scroll!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the A.I. Chip’s detection, it was a power magical object. On it, a contract formation was sealed within. It had to cost at least tens of thousands of magic crystals. Moreover, one may not be able to buy it even with money!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis price has long since surpassed the price of many magical creatures for magicians.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom this, one could see that only those large families which had been around for many years could possess many great items.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin looked at Bosain who was opening the scroll and his lips curled up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A pity that it is such a powerful contract scroll. If it were used against a youngling of a powerful creature, there could still be a chance of success. However, this Black Horrall Snake’s spiritual force is not in such a lowered state….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBosain who was without the A.I. Chip would naturally not think of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, his face carried a fevered gaze. Coupled with his trembling hands, he chanted an incantation and ripped opened the magical scroll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*Bang!*\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn extremely radiant white light rose in front of Bosain and the black snake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe white continuously circulated, finally forming a strange magic formation. On it was laced with mysterious runes and magic characters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An advanced contract spell formation! A.I. Chip, record!” Leylin immediately gave the order to the A.I. Chip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come! Become my contractual partner!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBosain muttered. From the formation a green light appeared, directly entering the forehead of Bosain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the other flash of green light, it was sent towards the Black Horrall Snake, moreover directly imprinting itself on the large skull of the Black Horrall Snake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if knowing that once it was bound to the contract and lose its freedom forever, the black snake thrashed continuously, resisting the entry of the green light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hurry! Faster!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCold sweat the size of beans trickled down Bosain’s face, staring intently at the skull of the Black Horrall Snake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My dream, my life, when I obtain this Black Horrall Snake…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust when the green light had completely entered the Black Horrall Snake’s head, a strange sight occurred!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-110\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-112\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-111","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:20 AM"}
