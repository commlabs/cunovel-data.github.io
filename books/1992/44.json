Almost forty-eight hours had passed since Jace drowned. Tourists had already gone back to their lives. It was the locals who were left to mourn. Woods hadn\u0027t wanted to leave the house yet. I was going to have to make him eventually but I didn\u0027t want to push him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought I should call Tripp but I didn\u0027t know what to say. He was probably with family. I would see him tomorrow at the funeral. I knew that. I just felt like I should call. Say something. He would mourn this just as hard as Woods. Jace was his cousin. He was like his little brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there was Bethy. I hadn\u0027t called Bethy. I wasn\u0027t sure how Woods would react to that. He obviously blamed her for Jace\u0027s death. I was afraid he always would. I wasn\u0027t sure if forgiveness could be granted to her for this. Not from Woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush had dropped by that morning to check on Woods. He had still been sleeping. I\u0027d told him I\u0027d let Woods know he came by. Grant had stopped by an hour later. His red-rimmed eyes reminded me of Woods\u0027s hollow look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoods hadn\u0027t been awake then, either. He had slept until eleven. When he realized I wasn\u0027t in bed with him he had jumped up and come after me. He hadn\u0027t said anything but pulled me into his lap. We had sat there for an hour in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I had told him about Rush and Grant stopping by. Then I\u0027d convinced him to get dressed and eat something. I turned from my view of the gulf and walked back into the kitchen to check on the chicken Parmesan I had put in the oven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoods walked out of the bedroom freshly showered and dressed in jeans and a T-shirt. \"I need to go to the office today,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lunch is almost ready. Can you eat first?\" I really wanted him to eat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After we eat I want us both to go. I want you with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t ask why, I just nodded. Right now he seemed to need me. I would be whatever he needed me to be. It was my turn to be the strong one. This time I would be his shoulder to lean on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It smells good,\" he said as he walked around the counter to kiss me. He was doing that a lot lately too. More than normal. Sometimes they were desperate, hungry kisses that led to more, but most of the time they were kisses that held words he couldn\u0027t say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to go to the store. I worked with what we had,\" I explained as I pulled the chicken out of the oven. I kept myself busy fixing us each a plate and toasting some bread and buttering it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soda?\" I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do we have sweet tea?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe did. I had made it that morning. I fixed him a glass while he carried our food to the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" he said as I set the drink down in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re welcome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached up and grabbed my hand. \"No. Thank you for being exactly what I needed and knowing when I wanted to speak and when I didn\u0027t.\" That was one of the longest sentences he\u0027d said since we\u0027d come home from the beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will always be whatever you need me to be,\" I said simply before taking my seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe ate for a few minutes in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to see his parents . . . and Tripp. He\u0027s called my phone twice. I should see him too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to go with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoods looked out at the water. \"Do you know when the funeral is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Rush said it was tomorrow at two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis jaw worked as he stared out the window. \"Will Bethy be there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027m sure she will be,\" I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis jaw continued to shift like he was clenching his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached over and took his hand. \"Woods. She loved him too. She made a mistake that she\u0027ll have to live with for the rest of her life, but she did love him. You know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t forgive her,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand that. But remember, he loved her. He loved her enough to die for her. She\u0027s suffering. Don\u0027t doubt that. She\u0027s suffering because she knows why this happened. You can hate her but try to remind yourself of the pain she has to be going through. And that Jace loved her more than he loved himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoods didn\u0027t say anything; he just sat there, letting me hold his hand while he stared out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone in Rosemary was at the funeral. There were more people there than I\u0027d ever seen at any event in town. Bethy was lifeless. Her face was pale and her cheeks were hollowed. She stood beside her aunt Darla and a man I assumed was her father. Jace\u0027s parents I had seen a few times at the club. His mother\u0027s eyes were red and swollen as she clung to his father\u0027s arm. Tripp stood to the side of them. He was dressed in a dark suit. You couldn\u0027t see his tattoos and he looked nothing like a biker bartender but more like the Ivy League graduate that he would have been if he hadn\u0027t run from his parents\u0027 plans for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoods held on to my hand like it was his lifeline. He hadn\u0027t let it go since we arrived. Rush also held Blaire\u0027s hand just as tightly. Nate wasn\u0027t with them today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant stood on the other side of Rush, his hands tucked in his front pockets and his face pinched in a permanent frown. It looked like he was trying not to cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others were there, too, but I couldn\u0027t see them from where we were standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach one of them had had an impact on the others\u0027 lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all had stories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had all loved, and many had lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had expected to grow up and become adults together. Get married and let their kids play together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d planned on being the next generation in Rosemary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat they hadn\u0027t planned on was losing one of their own. Losing a member of their tight group. They hadn\u0027t seen their future minus one. Death hadn\u0027t touched them before. Not like this. Not one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was about to change. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/simple-perfection-perfection-2/page-44.html","bookId":1992,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM"}
