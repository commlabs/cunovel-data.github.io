The boss had volunteered me for one of those \u0027Industry into Schools\u0027 days. One of those days where instead of sitting listening to their teacher drone on for hours, children were made to listen to sacrificial lambs like me telling them how wonderful the job they really despised was. I hated it. I hated speaking in public. I hated compromising myself and not being honest. I hated knowing that if I didn\u0027t do this and I didn\u0027t do it well, my end of month bonus would be reduced. My boss believed that his middle-managers were the figureheads of his company. In reality we were just there for him to hide behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy talk didn\u0027t last long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d made some notes which I held in front of me like a shield. I felt quite calm inside, but the way that the end of my papers shook seemed to give the class the impression that I was paralysed with nerves. The sadistic sixteen year olds quickly seized on my apparent weakness. When I coughed and tripped on a word I was history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The work we do at Caradine Computers is extremely varied and interesting,\u0027 I began, lying through my teeth. \u0027We\u0027re responsible for...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Sir,\u0027 a lad said from the middle of the room. He was waving his hand in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Why don\u0027t you just give up now,\u0027 he sighed. \u0027We\u0027re not interested.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat stopped me dead. I\u0027d never have dared speak out like that at school. I looked to the teacher at the back of the class for support but as soon as we\u0027d made eye contact she turned to look out of the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027As I was saying,\u0027 I continued, \u0027we look after a wide range of clients, from small one-man firms to multinational corporations. We advise them on the software to use, the systems to buy and...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother interruption, this time more physical. A fight was breaking out in the corner of the room. One boy had another in a headlock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027James Clyde,\u0027 the teacher yelled across the classroom, \u0027cut it out. Anyone would think you didn\u0027t want to listen to Mr Collins.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if the behaviour of the students wasn\u0027t bad enough, now even the teacher was being sarcastic. I didn\u0027t know whether she\u0027d meant her words to sound that way, but that was definitely how the rest of the class had taken them. Suddenly there was stifled laughter coming from all sides, hidden by hands over mouths and pierced by the occasional splutter from those who couldn\u0027t keep their hilarity in check. Within seconds the whole room was out of control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was about to give up and walk out when it happened. A girl in the far right corner of the room was coughing. Far more than any ordinary splutter, this was a foul, rasping and hacking scream of a cough which sounded as if it was tearing the very insides of her throat apart with each painful convulsion. I took a few steps towards the girl and then stopped. Other than her painful choking the rest of the room had become silent. I watched as her head dropped down and thick sticky strings of blood and spit dripped and trailed into her cupped hands and over her desk. For a second she looked up at me with huge terrified eyes. She couldn\u0027t breath. She was suffocating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked towards the teacher again. This time she stared straight back at me, fear and confusion written clearly across her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other side of the room a boy began to cough. He too was suddenly gripped with unexpected terror and excruciating pain. He too could no longer breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA girl just behind and to the right of me began to cry and then to cough. The teacher tried to stand up and walk towards me but then stopped as she also began to cough and splutter. Within no more than a minute of the first girl\u0027s agony beginning, every single person in the room was tearing at their throats and fighting to breathe. Every single person, that was, except me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know what to do or where to go to get help. Numb with shock, I staggered back towards the classroom door. I stumbled and tripped over a school bag and grabbed hold of the nearest desk to steady myself. A girl\u0027s hand slammed down on mine. I stared into her face. She was deathly white save for a crimson trickle of blood which spilled down her chin and onto the books on her desk. Her head kept lurching back on her shoulders as she tried desperately to breathe in precious molecules of oxygen. Each uncontrolled spasm of her body forced much more air out of her lungs than was allowed in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrenched my hand away and threw the door open. The noise inside the room was appalling. A deafening, echoing cacophony of desperate cries which pierced right through me, but even out in the hallway there was no escape. The pitiful noises which came from my classroom were only a small fraction of the screaming confusion which rang through the entire school. From places as remote as assembly halls, gymnasiums, workshops, kitchens and offices, the cold morning air was filled with the terrified screams of hundreds of desperate children and adults, all of them suffocating and choking to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time I\u0027d reached the end of the corridor it was over. The school was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI instinctively walked down the stairs towards the main entrance doors. Sprawled on the ground at the foot of the staircase was the body of a boy. He must have been only eleven or twelve. I crouched down next to him and cautiously reached out to touch him. I pulled my hand away as soon as it made contact with his dead flesh. It felt cold, clammy and unnatural, almost like wet leather. Forcing myself to try and take control of my fear and disgust, I pushed his shoulder and rolled him over onto his back. Like the others I had seen his face was ghostly white and was smeared with blood and spittle. I leant down as close as I dare and put my ear next to his mouth. I held my breath and waited to hear even the slightest sounds of breathing. I wished that the suddenly silent world would become quieter still so that I could hear something. It was hopeless. There was nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked out into the cool September sunlight and crossed the empty playground. Just one glance at the devastated scene outside the school gates was enough for me to realise that whatever it was that had happened inside the building had happened outside too. Random bodies littered the streets for as far as I could see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn seven hours since it happened I\u0027ve seen no-one else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy house is cold and secure but it doesn\u0027t feel safe. I can\u0027t stay there. I have to keep looking. I can\u0027t be the only one left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phones aren\u0027t working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s no electricity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s nothing but static on the radio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve never been so fucking frightened. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-autumn-1/page-3.html","bookId":2557,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:10 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:51:10 AM"}
