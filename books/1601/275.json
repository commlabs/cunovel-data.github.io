She went back to Galad’s side, sat down and took his hand. When would an Aes Sedai come to Heal him? He was still unconscious, save for nightmare whispers. He twisted, and something sparkled at his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBerelain reached under his shirt, taking out a medallion. It was in the shape of a fox’s head. She rubbed her finger across it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" . . back to Cauthon . . \". Galad whispered, eyes closed. \" . . . Hope . . \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBerelain thought for a moment, feeling that darkness outside as if it were the Dark One’s own, smothering the land and crawling in through windows, under doors. She rose, left Galad and walked quickly away, carrying the medallion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Amyrlin Seat is dead\", Arganda reported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood and bloody ashes, Mat thought. Egwene. Not Egwene too? It hit him like a punch to the face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What’s more\", Arganda continued, \"the Aes Sedai report that they have lost over half their numbers. The ones remaining claim . . . and this is a quote . . . that they ‘couldn’t channel enough of the One Power to lift a feather.’ They’re out of the battle\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat grunted. \"How many of the Sharan channelers did they take?\" he asked, bracing himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All of them\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat looked at Arganda and frowned. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All of the channelers\", Arganda said. \"All the ones that were fighting the Aes Sedai\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That’s something\", Mat said. But Egwene . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. No thinking of that right now. She and her people had stopped the Sharan channelers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Sharans and Trollocs fell back from the front lines to regroup. Mat took the opportunity to do the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis forces—what remained of them—were strung out across the Heights. He had joined together everyone he had left. The Borderlanders, the Dragonsworn, Loial and the Ogier, Tam’s troops, the Whitecloaks, soldiers of the Band of the Red Hand. They fought hard, but their foe greatly outnumbered them. It was bad enough when they just had the Sharans to contend with, but once the Trollocs had broken through on the eastern edge of the Heights, they were forced to defend themselves on two fronts. Over the past hour they had been pushed back more than a thousand paces, in a northerly direction, and their back ranks had almost reached the end of the plateau.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis would be the last push. The end of the battle. With the Sharan channelers gone, Mat would not be wiped out immediately, but Light . . . there were still so many bloody Trollocs left. Mat had danced this dance well. He knew he had. But there was only so much a man could do. Even Tuon’s return might not be enough, if it came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArganda handled reports from the other areas of the battlefield—the man was wounded badly enough he could not fight, and there was no one with enough of the Power left to spare for Healing. He did his job well. Good man. Mat could have used him in the Band.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Trollocs gathered for their push, again moving bodies out of the way, forming into fists with Myrddraal leading them. That would give Mat five or ten minutes to get ready. Then it would come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan walked over, expression grim. \"What would you have my men do, Cauthon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get ready to fight those Trollocs\", Mat said. \"Has anyone checked with Mayene lately? Now would be a wonderful time to get back a few ranks of men who have been Healed\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will check on it for you\", Lan said. \"And then I will prepare my men\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat dug in his saddlebags as Lan withdrew. He pulled out Rand’s banner, the one of the ancient Aes Sedai. He’d gathered it earlier, thinking perhaps it might have some use. \"Somebody hoist this thing up. We’re fighting in Rand’s bloody name. Let’s show the Shadow we’re proud of it\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDannil took the banner, finding a spear to use as a pole. Mat took a deep breath. The way the Borderlanders spoke, they thought this would end in a glorious, heroic, suicidal charge. That was how Thom’s songs always ended . . . the kinds of songs Mat had hoped to never find himself in. Faint hope that was, now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink, think. In the distance, the Trolloc horns started blowing. Tuon had delayed. Was she going to come? He hoped, secretly, she would not. With the battle going so poorly, even the Seanchan might not be enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needed an opening. Come on, luck! Another gateway opened, and Arganda went to collect the messenger’s report. Mat did not need to hear to realize the kind of news it was, as when Arganda returned, he was frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right\", Mat said, sighing. \"Give me your news\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Queen of Andor is dead\", Arganda said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloody Ashes! Not Elayne! Mat felt a lurch inside. Rand . . . I\u0027m sorry. \"Who leads there? Bashere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dead\", Arganda said. \"And his wife. They fell during an attack against the Andoran pikemen. We’ve lost six Aiel clan chiefs as well. Nobody leads the Andorans or the Aiel at the riverbed. They’re crumbling fast\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the end!\" Demandred’s augmented voice washed across Mat from the other end of the plateau. \"Lews Therin has abandoned you! Cry out to him as you die. Let him feel your pain\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had arrived at the last few moves in their game, and Demandred had played well. Mat looked over his army of exhausted troops, many of them wounded. There was no denying it, they were in a desperate situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Send for the Aes Sedai\", Mat said. \"I don’t care if they say they can’t lift a feather. Maybe when it comes down to their lives, they’ll find a little strength for a fireball here and there. Besides, their Warders can still fight\". Arganda nodded. Nearby, a gateway opened, and two beleaguered-looking Asha’man stumbled out. Naeff and Neald bore scorch marks on their skins, and Naeff’s Aes Sedai was not with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" Mat asked the three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is done\", Neald said with a growl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What of Tuon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They found the spy, apparently\", Naeff said. \"The Empress is waiting to return on your mark\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMat breathed in, tasting the battlefield air, feeling the rhythm of the fighting he had set up. He didn’t know if he could win, even with Tuon. Not with Elayne’s army in disarray, not with the Aes Sedai weakened to the point of being unable to channel. Not without Egwene, her Two Rivers stubbornness, her iron backbone. Not without a miracle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Send for her, Naeff\", Mat said. He called for paper and a pen, and scribbled a note, which he handed off to the Asha’man. He shoved aside the selfish desire to let Tuon fly to safety. Bloody ashes, there was no safety, not anywhere. \"Give this to the Empress, Naeff; tell her these instructions must b \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-275.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
