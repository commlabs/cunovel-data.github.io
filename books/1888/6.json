{"id":84731,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look like I do going to the gym, same ponytail and no makeup. She, however, dolls up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look like Plain-Jane next to her, exactly how I like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrossing the parking lot, we run into a group of people. \"Hey Michelle,\" One of the girls calls out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at Shell. She shrugs, \"Stuart took me out last night. I met her in the seating line up at a pub. Be right back.\" She runs over to where the girl is huddled with other girls. She makes friends everywhere. It\u0027s how I met her. She forced me to talk to her. I shiver and push away the memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t run over. I stand where I was and notice a couple of the guys in the group walking toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi.\" An amazing looking guy nods at me. His grin makes me feel dirty. It\u0027s a bad feeling. \"What\u0027s your name?\" I feel like I\u0027m in trouble when he looks at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her name is none of your business. Now let\u0027s go.\" Shell storms back over and grabs my hand. She pulls me away just in the nick of time. Just as my hands started to sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer long, leggy steps are ridiculous in the four-inch heels. She drags me down the street. When we get to the bar, Shell looks back at the girls behind us and grins. Three of them run up to where we are. They shorten skirts and plump breasts as we near the huge lineup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the girls leans into me, \"You should probably stand back with the dudes or tie your shirt up and pull your jeans down to the hipbones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown and look at Shell, \u0027\"Are you for real?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShell nods, \"They won\u0027t let you in if you don’t look hot. Smoking hot. Otherwise it\u0027s the line up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might have let me in on that before we left the house.\" I murmur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wouldn’t have come. Stop being a baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look past her at the huge line up and then down at my thin black t-shirt. I then look back at the hot guy with the scary smile. He winks at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, hell no.\" I roll my shirt up into my bra and reef on my jeans. They sit just above my underwear. I shiver and wrap my hands around my now naked midsection. If sister Elizabeth saw me now she would flog me. I can feel the flogging if I let myself get too wrapped up in the fear of exposing myself like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy phone vibrates instantly. I know Stuart is probably spying on us and reporting back to the master. I take deep breaths when the bouncer gives us the greasiest smile ever, and pulls the rope aside for us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tall blonde points back at the guys, \"They\u0027re with us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guys hustle through too. The creepy one is pressed into my back. His hands are near my sides. I can feel the warmth of him on my bare skin, brushing against me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are rushed through to the club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music pumps so hard I can feel it in my teeth. The panic starts to set in, but in the middle of it all something happens. Something that has never happened before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like the song that\u0027s playing and the room smells like something familiar, in a good way. I look around and no one notices me. No one is looking at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let Shell pull me out onto the dance floor. I pull my t-shirt down and jeans up a bit. We start to dance. I\u0027ve never been a big dancer so I\u0027m surprised when I like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start giving into urges and throwing my arms up and letting my hair down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m having fun. I\u0027m not the prettiest girl. The bar is full of them. The boys aren\u0027t touching me or trying to talk to me. The fears I have are numbed by the fact I\u0027m not getting the attention I feared I would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, not until a tall guy in a light-blue shirt and dark-gray slacks walks up to me. He\u0027s dressed fancy for a bar in a college town. His face is handsome in a way that commands my instant respect. He looks like he should have supermodels on either arm, or be in a music video. He doesn\u0027t look older, just confident and dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles at me and it\u0027s scary and cold. \"Want to dance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can barely hear him over the music. I shake my head, \"No, thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles at me and looks down. He has dark hair in a faux hawk and a dimple in his left cheek. I know him. I swear it. It almost scares me. His icy-blue eyes are so familiar, but like they\u0027re locked behind a haze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I know you?\" I ask, almost like I\u0027m in a dream. He looks at me with confusion mixed with a subtle hint of severity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so.\" He looks around. His cool demeanor and stylish clothes are catching the eyes of the girls around us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hits me when I look at the other guys in the bar. He is controlling himself and moody compared to the other guys. He looks severe and harsh. I can\u0027t help but wonder why he\u0027s talking to me. The girl who looks like she might be the janitor, not the girls who are almost naked and grinding up against each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hits me like a ton of bricks and I know why he\u0027s talking to me. I grin sarcastically, \"Are you him? Are you my guardian?\" I am smarter than he gives me credit for being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis cold blue eyes harden and he instantly looks more confused and less interested in me. \"Him who? What?\" He takes a step back and laughs, like he\u0027s confused but also mocking me. He rolls his icy eyes, \"I just wanted a dance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown. He turns and walks away. It stings a bit, he rejected me and somehow I feel like a head case from it. Like I\u0027m crazy for thinking he could be the man helping me. I\u0027ve never felt rejection. People are usually overly kind to me. Except the nuns and fathers. Growing up, we were always made to work hard and respect people. We were treated based on how we acted. I learned that quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach into my back pocket and pour the hand sanitizer into my palm. I rub and close my eyes. The smell is therapy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShell must have seen it. Her icy cold hands grip my arm and shock me. I spin wide eyed, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks over to where the guy disappears into the crowd, \"Was he bugging you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. But she eyeballs the hand sanitizer and makes her own conclusions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This was a mistake. We should go.\" She looks worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"No. It\u0027s fine. I like it here. It\u0027s so intense and busy, I actually feel lost in the crowd. Like I blend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face splits, \"Oh man.\" She sighs, \"I\u0027m so glad. I was stressed about bringing you here dude. I know it\u0027s my job to push the New Leaf thing, but I was scared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"Let\u0027s dance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe arches an eyebrow, \"Wanna drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost say no. I pause and give the question the moment it deserves. I nod. I\u0027m not scared of the bar. I don\u0027t hate it. I wanted a normal college life. One drink is definitely normal. If it\u0027s not normal, it\u0027s New Leaf for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe comes back after a minute with a bottle of beer. She passes it to me and squeals, \"The bartender thought I was twenty-one. He sold these to me.\" She widens her eyes in excitement and drinks. She brings it down and clinks it against mine, \"To a New Leaf.\" She shouts, grinning and looking around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe is having so much fun. I love it. I can\u0027t help but wonder, if I can suck some of the fun off of her and force myself to be more outgoing like her. If I can force myself to not look to closely at the people around us, or the fact I am teetering on the edge of something bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand closer and compel myself to loosen up. I drink a gulp of beer. It isn’t a big thing to her, but I\u0027ve never drunk beer. It tastes sick, but I force myself to drink it. It\u0027s freedom and adulthood and a New Leaf. Okay, it\u0027s a lot to place on one beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emalyn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look to where I\u0027ve heard my name. My face instantly becomes happiness in a look. My breath is caught in my chest. The pounding beat of the music and the pair of hazel eyes looking at me, are making me happy. Divinely happy. It\u0027s a new feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sebastian.\" I had no idea how hot he actually was. Seeing him dressed up, not casual at all, is impressive. I forget my name momentarily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile is bright. He looks at my beer confusedly, \"Never saw you as a bar and a beer kind of girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"First beer and first bar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe steps in closer, so he doesn’t have to shout. He smells so good my palms sweat, probably for hand sanitizer, he\u0027s pretty close. I fight off the urge. He leans down into my neck and speaks close to my ear, \"You doing okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could love this guy. If my heart ever decided to open up to anyone, it would be him I choose. I nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis breath tickles my neck, \"If you need out of here you just let me know, okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile into his shoulder and sigh, \"Yup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stands back up. It makes some kind of cross breeze and his cologne, that I must have missed when I smelled him, is wafted back at me. It takes up all the sweaty air around me. In that moment, I feel it. The wall. The beer almost slips from my hands. I pass it to him, \"Can you just hold this. I need to go to the ladies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods. I point to Shell, who I realize is watching me like a hawk, and point between them. \"Michelle, my roommate, Sebastian, the guy from the gym.\" I turn and run to the bathroom. The sea of people is thick and heady. I shove my way through. The cold air of the bathroom is a comfort. I take in gulps of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy shirt is soaked. I slip into a stall and pull it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis cologne made me freak out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit is wrong with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow cologne made the air dirty. It made a wall of sin and sick twisted desires. It hurt deep in my belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears are flooding my eyes and I\u0027m standing in the stall, waving my shirt back and forth, trying to dry it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith shaking hands and blinding tears that won\u0027t leave my eyes, I pull my cell from my pants. I can\u0027t text. The words don’t make sense. I fat finger the buttons in a panic. I delete the messages and hold the phone to my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start my affirmations in a breathy whisper, \"You are alive. You aren’t fighting the whole world. It\u0027s just a few people in a bar. They don’t see you. Frig the bar. This is a tiny stall. It\u0027s a small room with a door and protection.\" I take a deep breath. My words feel thick with saliva and the distraught fear that cripples me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy legs become heavy. I need to run before my legs become cement blocks. I pull the shirt on and storm from the bathroom. I slip along the back wall. In the corner of my eyes I see them. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lonely-the-lonely-1/page-6.html","bookId":1888,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:39 PM"}
