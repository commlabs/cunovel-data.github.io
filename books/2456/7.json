{"id":80776,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"\u003cp\u003eWesker! barry shouted, his deep voice echoing through the chilly room. Captain Wesker!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jogged toward a row of arches at the back of the hall, calling to Jill over his shoulder as he ran. Don\u0027t leave the room!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill walked to the stairs, feeling almost dizzy. First Chris, now the captain. They hadn\u0027t been gone five minutes and he\u0027d said he was going to stay put. Why would he have left? She looked around for signs of a struggle, a spent cartridge, a spot of blood - there was nothing to indicate what might have happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry appeared on the other side of the giant staircase, shaking his head and walking slowly to join her. Jill bit her lower lip, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou think Wesker ran into one of those-things? she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry sighed. I don\u0027t think the RPD showed and snuck him out. Though if he did run into trouble, we would have heard the shots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot necessarily. He could have been ambushed, dragged away...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stood silently for a moment, thinking. Jill was still a bit shaken from the face-to-face with the walking corpse, but thought she\u0027d accepted the facts pretty well; the woods bordering Raccoon City had become infested with zombies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a lifetime of reading trashy novels about serial killers, is a cannibal zombie so hard to swallow?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow it wasn\u0027t, and neither were the murderous dogs or the secretly kept estate. There was no question that it all existed. The question was, why? Did the mansion have anything to do with the murders, or had the zombies simply overrun it like they\u0027d overrun Raccoon Forest?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd was that creature the last thing Becky and Pris saw?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rejected that thought almost violently; thinking about the girls now would be a mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo do we go looking or do we wait? Jill said finally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo looking. Ken made it here. The rest of the Bravos could be somewhere in this house. It\u0027d be easy enough to get lost. Chris...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe half-smiled, though Jill could see the worry in his eyes. Chris and Wesker got-side-tracked, but we\u0027ll find them. It\u0027d take more than a couple of walking stiffs to cause either of them any grief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached into a pocket in his vest and pulled out something wrapped in a handkerchief, handing it to her. She felt the thin metal objects beneath the light fabric and recognized them instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s the set you gave me to practice with last month, he said. I figure you\u0027ll have better luck with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill nodded, tucking the lockpicks into her hip pouch. Barry had taken an interest in her former career and she\u0027d given him a few pieces from her old set, several picks and torsion bars. They could come in handy. The small bundle settled on top of something hard and smooth-Trent\u0027s computer! In all the excitement, she\u0027d totally forgotten about her strange encounter in the locker room. She opened her mouth to tell Barry, then shut it, remembering Trent\u0027s cryptic warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wouldn\u0027t mention this conversation to anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrew that. She\u0027d almost risked it anyway with Chris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd where is Chris now? Who\u0027s to say that Trent\u0027s dire consequences haven\u0027t already occurred?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill realized what she was thinking and had to fight off an urge to laugh at herself. What had happened with Trent probably wasn\u0027t even relevant to their predicament, and whether or not she could trust Barry, she knew she didn\u0027t trust Trent - still, she decided not to say anything about it, at least until she had a chance to see what the computer held.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think we should split up, Barry continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know it\u0027s dangerous, but we need to cover a lot of ground. We find anybody, we meet back here, use this room as base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubbing at his beard, he fixed her with a serious gaze. You up for this, Jill? We could search together...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, you\u0027re right, she said. I can take the west wing. Unlike cops, S.T.A.R.S. seldom partnered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were trained to watch their own backs in dangerous situations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry nodded. Okay. I\u0027ll go back and see if I can persuade one of those doors to open. Keep an eye out for a back exit, conserve ammo... and be careful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarry grinned, holding up his Colt Python. I\u0027ll be fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing left to say. Jill headed straight for the set of doors on the west wall that Wesker hadn\u0027t tried earlier. Behind her, Barry hurried back to the dining room. She heard the door open and close, leaving her alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere goes nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe painted blue doors opened smoothly, revealing a small, shadowy room as cool and silent as the main hall, all in shades of blue. Muted track lighting illuminated framed paintings on dusky walls, and in the center of the room was a large statue of a woman holding an urn on one shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill closed the door behind her and let her eyes adjust to the gloom, noting the two doors opposite the one she\u0027d come through. The one on the left was open, though a small chest was pushed in front of it, blocking access. It was unlikely that Wesker had gone that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked to the one on the right and tried the knob. Locked. Sighing, she reached into her pack for the picks and then hesitated, feeling the smooth weight of the mini-disk reader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0027s see what Mr. Trent thinks is so important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slipped it out and studied it a moment, then tapped at a switch. A screen the size of a baseball card flickered to life, and with a few more taps, small lines of type scrolled across the monitor. She scanned the material, recognizing names and dates from local newspapers. Trent had apparently compiled every article he could find about the murders and disappearances in Raccoon, plus the pieces on the S.T.A.R.S.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing new here... Jill skipped along, wondering what the point was. After the articles was a list of names.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWILLIAM BIRKIN,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSTEVE KELLER,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMICHAEL DEES,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJOHN HOWE,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMARTIN CRAGKHORN,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHENRY SARTON,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eELLEN SMITH,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBILL RABBITSON\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. None of the names were familiar, Except - wasn\u0027t Bill Rabbitson Chris\u0027s friend, the one who had worked for Umbrella? She couldn\u0027t be sure, she\u0027d have to ask Chris... ... assuming we find him. This was a waste of time; she needed to start looking for the other S.T.A.R.S.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pressed the forwarding key to get to the end of the data and a picture appeared, tiny lines set into patterns. There were squares and long rectangles, crosshatched with smaller marks that connected the empty boxes. Beneath it was a single line, a message as enigmatic as she could have expected from Mr. Trent:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKNIGHT KEYS;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIGER EYES;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFOUR CRESTS (GATE OF NEW LIFE);\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEAST-EAGLE/WEST-WOLF.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGee, how illuminating. That just clears up everything, doesn\u0027t it? The picture was some kind of map, she decided. It looked like a floor plan. The biggest area was at the center, a slightly smaller one extending off to the left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill suddenly felt her heart skip a beat. She stared down at the small screen, wondering how Trent had known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the mansion\u0027s first floor. She tapped the forward button again and saw what could only be the second floor, the shapes corresponding to the first map. There was nothing after the second map, but it was enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs far as she was concerned, there was no longer any question that the Spencer estate was the source of the terror in Raccoon City, which meant that the answers were here, waiting to be uncovered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe zombie groaned as Chris fired point-blank into its gut, twice. The shots were muffled by its rancid flesh and it fell against him, expelling a rush of foul, stinking air across his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris pushed it away, the back of his throat locking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands and the barrel of his weapon were dripping with sticky fluids. The creature collapsed to the floor, its limbs spasming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris backed away, wiping the Beretta against his vest as he took deep breaths, trying desperately not to vomit. The zombie out in the hall had been a desiccated mess, shriveled and dry; this one was-fresh, if that was the right word. Festering, necrotic, wet...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallowed, hard, and the urge to throw up slowly passed. He didn\u0027t have a particularly weak stomach, but that smell, God!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeep it together, could be more of them...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hall he\u0027d entered was all dark wood and dim light. For the moment, there was no sound except the pulse of blood in his ears. He looked down at the body, wondering exactly what it was, what it had been. He had felt its hot, fetid breath against his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t a reanimated corpse, no matter what it looked like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe decided it didn\u0027t matter. For all intents and purposes, it was a zombie. It had tried to bite him, and creatures like it had already chowed down on some of Raccoon\u0027s population. He needed to find his way back to the others and they had to get out, get help. They didn\u0027t have the firepower to handle the situation alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ejected the empty clip from the gummy weapon and quickly reloaded, his chest tightening with stress; fifteen rounds left. He had a Bowie knife, but the thought of going up against a zombie with only a knife wasn\u0027t all that appealing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a plain-looking door to his left. Chris pulled at the knob, but it was locked. He squinted at the key plate, and wasn\u0027t all that surprised to see an etching of what looked like armor. Sword, armorthere was a definite theme developing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved down the wide hall, listening for any sound and taking frequent deep breaths through his nose. The goo on his vest and hands made it hard to tell if there were any more of them around, the smell was all over him, but it could be his only chance to avoid another close encounter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hall turned to the left and he took the corner fast, sweeping the Beretta across the wide wooden expanse. There was a support pillar partially blocking his view but he could see the back of a man just past it, the slumped shoulders and stained clothes of one of the creatures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris quickly edged to the right, trying to get a clear shot. The zombie was maybe forty feet away, and he didn\u0027t want to waste his last rounds. At the sound of his boots against the hard wood floor, it turned, shuffling slowly. So slowly that Chris hesitated, watching the way it moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis one seemed to have been dipped in a thin layer of slime, dull light reflecting off of its glistening skin as it stumbled almost blindly toward Chris. It slowly raised its arms, its pale, hairless skull wobbling on its emaciated neck. Silently, it shuffled forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris took a sliding step back to his left and the zombie changed direction, veering toward him eagerly, closing the distance between them at a slow walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like in the movies; dangerous but dumb. And easy to outrun...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to save ammo in case he got cornered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were stairs at the end of the hall, and Chris took a deep breath, readying himself. He stepped back, giving himself enough room to maneuver-and heard a gasping moan behind him, a fresh wave of rancid stink assaulting his senses. He spun, the realization hitting him even before he saw it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe festering zombie was only a few feet away, reaching for him, bits of its putrid gut spilling out across its shattered abdomen. He hadn\u0027t killed it, hadn\u0027t waited long enough to make sure, and his stupidity was about to cost him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, shit!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris sprinted away and down the corridor, dodging both of them and cursing himself. He passed the thick support beam, almost to the stairs-and stopped cold, seeing what waited at the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught only a glimpse of the ragged creature standing at the head of the stairs and spun away, raising his weapon to face the attackers that shambled toward him hungrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the shadows beneath the steps came a heavy, gurgling sigh and the scuffing of wood; another one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was trapped, there was no way he could kill them all - door!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt faced the side of the stairs, the dark wood blending so well with the shadows that he almost hadn\u0027t seen it. Chris ran for it, grabbing at the handle, praying that it would open as around him, the creatures closed in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it was locked, he was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRebecca Chambers had never been more afraid, not once in her eighteen years. For what seemed like an eternity, she\u0027d listened to the soft scrape of rotting flesh brushing against the door and tried desperately to think of a plan, her dread building with each passing minute. There was no lock on the door, and she\u0027d lost her handgun on the run for the house. The small storage room, though well stocked with chemicals and stacks of papers, had offered nothing to use as a defense except a half-empty can of insect repellent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the can she gripped now, standing behind the door of the tiny room. If or when the monsters finally figured out how to use a doorknob, she planned on spraying it in their eyes and then making a run for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe they\u0027ll be laughing so hard I\u0027ll have a chance to slip past; bug spray, great weapon...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d heard what could have been shots somewhere close by, but they weren\u0027t repeated. Her hope that it was one of the team faded as the seconds ticked past, and she was starting to give serious consideration to the concept that she was the only one left when the door burst open and a gasping figure hurdled inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRebecca didn\u0027t hesitate. She leapt forward and pressed the button, releasing a cloud of chemical mist into its face, tensing herself to run past it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGah! It yelled, and fell back against the door, slamming it shut. It covered its eyes, spluttering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t a monster; she\u0027d just maced one of the Alphas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, no! Rebecca was already reaching into her field medical kit, her immense relief at seeing another of the S.T.A.R.S. battling with monumental embarrassment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fumbled out a clean cloth and a tiny squeeze bottle of water, stepping toward him. Keep your eyes closed, don\u0027t rub at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Alpha dropped his hands, face red, and she finally recognized him. It was Chris Redfield, only the most attractive guy in the S.T.A.R.S., not to mention her superior. She felt herself blush, and was suddenly glad that he couldn\u0027t see her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice going, Rebecca. Way to make a good impression on your first operation. Lose your gun, get lost, blind a teammate...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe led him over to the small cot in the corner of the room and sat him down, letting her training take over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLean your head back. This is going to sting a little, but it\u0027s just water, okay? She dabbed at his eyes with the damp cloth, relieved that she hadn\u0027t sprayed him with anything worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was that stuff? he said, blinking rapidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears and water streamed down his face, but there didn\u0027t seem to be any damage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh, bug repellent. The label\u0027s been ripped off but the active ingredient is probably permephrin, it\u0027s an irritant but the effect shouldn\u0027t last long. I lost my gun, and when you came in I thought you were one of those things, though if they haven\u0027t figured out how to use a doorknob by now, they probably won\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe realized she was babbling and shut up, finishing the crude irrigation and stepping back. Chris wiped at his face and peered up at her with bloodshot eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRebecca... Chambers, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded miserably. Yeah. Look, I\u0027m really Sorry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t worry about it, he said, and smiled. Not a bad weapon, actually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up and looked around the small room, frowning. There wasn\u0027t much to see: an open trunk full of papers, a shelf lined with bottles of mostly unlabeled chemicals, a cot, and a desk. Rebecca had been through it all in her search for something to use against the creatures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat about the rest of your team? he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRebecca shook her head. I don\u0027t know. Something went wrong with the helicopter and we had to set down. We were attacked by animals, some kind of dogs, and Enrico told us to run for cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged, suddenly feeling like she was about twelve years old. I got-turned around in the woods and ended up at the front door of this place. I think one of the others broke it down, it was open...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe trailed off, looking away from his intense gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest was probably obvious: she had no weapon, she\u0027d gotten lost, she\u0027d ended up here. All in all, a pretty poor showing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey, he said softly. There\u0027s nothing else you could have done. Enrico said run, you ran, you followed orders. Those creatures out there, the zombies... they\u0027re all over the place. I got lost, too, and the rest of the Alphas could be anywhere. Trust me, just the fact that you made it this far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, one of the monsters let out a low, plaintive wail and Chris stopped talking, his expression grim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRebecca shuddered. So what do we do now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe look for the others and try to find a way out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed, looking down at his weapon. Except you don\u0027t have a gun and I\u0027m almost out of ammo...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRebecca brightened and reached into her hip pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled out two full magazines and handed them over, pleased that she had something to offer him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh! And I found this on the desk, she said, and produced a silver key with a sword on it. She didn\u0027t know what it unlocked, but thought it might be useful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris stared at it thoughtfully, then slipped it into a pocket. He walked to the open trunk and looked down at the stacks of papers. He rifled through them, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour background\u0027s in biochemistry, right? Have you looked through these?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRebecca joined him, shaking her head. Barely. I\u0027ve been kinda busy watching the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe handed her one of the papers and she scanned it quickly. It was a list of neurotransmitters and level indicators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrain chemistry, she said, but these numbers are all screwed up. The serotonin and norepinephrine are too low... but look here, the dopamine is off the chart, we\u0027re talking big-time schizo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe noticed the incredulous look on his face and smiled a little. Being an eighteen-year-old college grad, she got a lot of that. The S.T.A.R.S. had recruited her right after graduation, promising her a whole team of researchers and a lab of her own to study molecular biology, her real passion-provided, of course, that she went through basic training and got some field experience. No one else had shown much interest in hiring a whiz kid...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a soft thump at the door and her smile faded. She was getting experience, alright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris fished the sword key out of his pocket and looked at her seriously. I passed a door with a sword engraved over the keyhole. I\u0027m going to go check it out, see if it leads back to the main hall. I want you to stay here and go through those files. Maybe there\u0027s something we can use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer uncertainty must have showed in her face. He smiled gently, his voice low and soothing. I\u0027ve got plenty of ammo, thanks to you, and I won\u0027t be gone long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, making a conscious effort to relax. She was scared, but letting him see it wasn\u0027t going to help matters. He was probably scared, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked to the door, still talking. The RPD should be here any time, so if I don\u0027t come back right away, just wait here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised the weapon, putting his other hand on the knob. Get ready. As soon as I\u0027m out, move the trunk in front of the door. I\u0027ll give a yell when I get back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRebecca nodded again, and with a final quick smile, Chris opened the door and looked both ways before moving out into the hall. She closed the door and leaned against it, listening. After long seconds of silence, she heard the rattle of gunfire not far away, five or six shots-then nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few minutes, she moved the trunk to block part of the door, edging it in front of the hinges so she could push it out of the way easily. She knelt in front of it, trying to clear her thoughts as she started looking through the papers, trying not to feel as young and unsure as she actually felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing, she pulled out a handful of papers and started to read. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-umbrella-conspiracy-resident-evil-1/page-7.html","bookId":2456,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:30:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:30:07 PM"}
