The only thing is I\u0027ll have to watch the tape to know if you\u0027re right or wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" she said. \"Well, what the hell. Let\u0027s watch it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIT started off looking like just what the label promised. The opening credits rolled and Lee Marvin went from cell to cell. We were introduced to the twelve American soldiers who would make up the dirty dozen, killers and rapists and all-around fuck-ups under death sentences for their crimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To my untrained eye,\" Elaine said, \"this looks remarkably like the movie I remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt went on looking like it for ten minutes or so, and I was beginning to wonder if Will might have problems beyond mere alcoholism and chemical dependency. Then the screen went abruptly blank right in the middle of a scene and the soundtrack cut out. The screen stayed blank for perhaps ten seconds, and then it showed a slender young man with a boyishly open, midwestern sort of face. He was cleanshaven, and his light brown hair was parted at the side and neatly combed. He was naked except for a canary-yellow towel around his middle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis wrists and ankles were shackled to an X-shaped metal frame that stood at a 60-degree angle to the floor. In addition to the metal shackles at his wrists and ankles, leather cuffs had been fitted around each leg just above the knee and each arm just above the elbow, and there was a matching leather belt around his waist, part of it obscured by the yellow towel. All of these devices looked to be holding him quite securely in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not appear to be particularly uncomfortable, and he had a tentative smile on his face. He said, \"Is that thing running? Hey, am I supposed to say anything or what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA male voice off-camera told him to shut up. The young man\u0027s mouth was open and he closed it. I could see now that he was no more than a boy, not so much cleanshaven as beardless. He was tall, but he didn\u0027t look to be more than sixteen or so. There was no hair on his chest, although he did have a pale tuft in each armpit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camera stayed on the boy, and a woman moved into the frame. She was about as tall as the boy but looked taller because she was standing erect, not spreadeagled and tied to a crossframe. She wore a mask, the sort of device the Lone Ranger wore, but hers looked to be of black leather. That made it a match for the rest of her outfit, skintight black leather pants open at the crotch and black gloves that covered her clear to the elbows. She wore black shoes with three-inch spike heels and silver trim at the toes, and that was all she wore. She was naked above the waist, and the nipples of her small breasts were erect. They were also scarlet, the same shade as her full mouth, and I suspected she\u0027d daubed them with lipstick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s that simple unspoiled look you go for,\" Elaine said. \"This is shaping up to be dirtier than The Dirty Dozen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did I tell you before? I can stand it if you can. I used to have a client who liked to watch bondage films. They always struck me as pretty silly. Would you ever want me to tie you up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or to tie me up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we\u0027re missing something. Fifty million perverts can\u0027t be wrong. Ah, here we go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman unfastened the boy\u0027s towel and tossed it aside. Her gloved hand caressed him, and he became aroused at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, youth,\" Elaine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camera moved in for a close-up of her hand gripping him, manipulating him. Then it pulled back and she released him and tugged at each finger of the glove in turn, finally removing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gypsy Rose Lee,\" Elaine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nails of the ungloved hand were painted with a polish that matched the lipstick on her mouth and nipples. She held the long glove in her bare hand and struck the boy across the chest with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up,\" she said. She sounded angry. She swung the glove again and hit him across the mouth. His eyes widened. She hit him on the chest, then struck his face again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Hey, watch it, huh? I mean, that really hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet it did,\" Elaine said. \"Look, she marked his face. I think she\u0027s getting carried away with the role.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man off-camera told the boy to be quiet. \"He told you to shut up,\" the woman said. She leaned across the boy\u0027s body, rubbing herself against him. She kissed his mouth, touched the fingertips of her bare hand to the mark her glove had left on his cheek. She moved lower and trailed kisses across his chest, her lipstick marking him where she kissed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hot stuff,\" Elaine said. She had been sitting on a chair, but now she came over and sat beside me on the couch and put her hand on my thigh. \"Guy told you you had to watch this tonight, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He tell you to have your girlfriend around while you watched it? Hmmm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand moved on my leg. I covered it with my hand, stopped its movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter?\" she said. \"I\u0027m not allowed to touch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could answer, the woman on the screen took the boy\u0027s penis in her gloved hand. Then, with her other hand, she swung the glove and struck him hard across the scrotum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Owww! Jesus, cut that out, will you? That hurt! Let me down, let me off this thing, I don\u0027t want to do this anymore-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was going on in that vein when the woman, her face a mask of cold fury, stepped forward and drove her knee into his unprotected groin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe screamed. The same off-camera male voice said, \"Tape his mouth, for Christ\u0027s sake. I don\u0027t want to listen to that shit. Here, get out of the way, I\u0027ll take care of it myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had assumed the male voice belonged to the cameraman, but there was no break in the filming while the voice\u0027s owner stepped into the picture. He looked to be wearing a skin diver\u0027s wet suit, but when I said as much to Elaine she corrected me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s rubber wear,\" she said. \"Black rubber. They have it custom-made.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who does?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rubber freaks. She\u0027s into leather, he\u0027s into rubber. \u0027Can This Marriage Be Saved?\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was wearing a black rubber mask as well, actually more of a hood that covered his entire head. There was a hole for each eye, and another for his nose and mouth. When he turned I saw that there was an opening as well at the crotch of the rubber suit. His penis protruded, long and limp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The man in the rubber mask,\" Elaine intoned. \"What has he got to hide?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You couldn\u0027t skin-dive in that thing, not unless you wanted the fish to give you a blow job. I can tell you one thing about this guy. He\u0027s not Jewish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had by this time covered the boy\u0027s mouth with several lengths of tape. Now the Leather Girl handed him her glove, and he left more red marks on the boy\u0027s skin. His hands were large, with dark hair on their backs. The rubber suit stopped at the wrists, and because his hands were nearly the only exposed part of him, I noticed them more than I might have otherwise. He was wearing a massive gold ring on the fourth finger of his right hand. It was set with a large polished stone I couldn\u0027t identify. It was either black or dark blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped to his knees now and took the boy in his mouth. When he had restored him to an erect state he drew back and wrapped a rawhide thong tightly around the base of the boy\u0027s penis. \"Now it\u0027ll stay hard,\" he told the woman. \"You stop the vein, the blood flows in but it can\u0027t flow out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like a roach motel,\" Elaine murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman straddled the boy, taking him into the opening in her leather pants and the corresponding opening in her flesh. She rode him while the man caressed them in turn, now cupping her bare breasts, then tweaking the boy\u0027s nipples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy\u0027s face kept changing expression. He was frightened but he was also excited. He winced in pain when they hurt him, but the rest of the time he looked wary, as if he wanted to enjoy what was happening but he was afraid of what might happen next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching, Elaine and I had ceased to comment on what we were seeing, and her hand had long since withdrawn from my thigh. There was something about the performance that stifled commentary as surely as the square of white tape quieted the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was beginning to have a very bad feeling about what we were watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy apprehension was confirmed when the pace of Leather Woman\u0027s ride picked up. \"Come on,\" she urged, breathless. \"Do his tits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubber Man moved out of the frame. He came back holding something, and at first I couldn\u0027t see what it was. Then I recognized it as a gardener\u0027s implement, something you\u0027d use to prune a rosebush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill riding the boy, she worked one of his nipples between her thumb and forefinger, rolling it, pulling at it. The man laid one hand on the boy\u0027s forehead. The boy\u0027s eyes were rolling wildly. Gently, tenderly, the man\u0027s hand moved to smooth back the light brown hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his other hand he positioned the pruning shears. \"Now!\" the woman demanded, but he waited, and she had to say it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, still stroking the boy\u0027s forehead, still smoothing his hair, he tightened his grip on the pruning shears and cut off the boy\u0027s nipple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI triggered the remote and the screen went blank. Elaine had her arms folded so that each hand was cupping the opposite elbow. Her upper arms were pressed against her sides and she was trembling slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"I don\u0027t think you want to watch the rest of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t respond right away, just sat there on the couch, breathing in and out, in and out. Then she said, \"That was real, wasn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They cut him, they, what do you call it, pruned, that\u0027s it, they pruned his nipple. If they got him to a hospital right away they could reattach it. Didn\u0027t one of the Mets-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bobby Ojeda. Last year, it was the tip of one finger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On his throwing hand, wasn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His pitching hand, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he was rushed to the hospital. I don\u0027t know if it would work with a nipple.\" Deep breaths, in and out. \"I don\u0027t suppose anybody rushed this kid to the hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t suppose so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel like I could pass out or throw up or something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bend over and put your head between your knees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then what, kiss my ass goodbye?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re feeling faint-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, to get the blood back in my head. I was just making a joke. \u0027She must be all right, Nurse, she\u0027s making jokes.\u0027 I\u0027m okay, though. You know me, I was brought up right, I\u0027m a good date, I never faint and I never puke and I never order the lobster. Matt, did you know that was going to happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clip, and his nipple\u0027s gone, and the blood just oozing out, trailing down across his chest. Flowing in a sort of zigzaggy line, like an old river. What\u0027s the word when a river does that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meandering, that\u0027s it. Blood meandering down his chest. Are you going to watch the rest of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027d better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s going to get worse, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will he bleed to death?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not from a cut like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happens? The blood just clots?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sooner or later.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9/page-9.html","bookId":2327,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:31 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:31 AM"}
