She must have knocked them over when she crossed into this world. Other people are staring at us and the window of red light, mouths open. Cars are slowing as they pass, drivers and passengers captivated by the spectacle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Close it!\" Nadia yells. I don\u0027t need telling twice. Before the vulture-headed demon can follow us, I dismantle the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNadia\u0027s on her feet. As soon as the red light vanishes, she grabs me and runs. We race through the crowd of startled bystanders. Nobody tries to stop us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe turn a corner, race down another busy street. Nadia leads me across the road, weaving through traffic, wincing at the blaring horns but otherwise taking no notice of the cars. Another corner, then another. Finally, in a quiet alley, she stops, releases me, squats beside a wall, leans her head against it, stares up at the clear blue sky - and whoops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We did it! You\u0027re a genius, Kernel! You got us out!\" She looks at me with happy tears in her eyes. \"I don\u0027t know how I\u0027ll ever repay you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile at Nadia, then frown and look around nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right,\" Nadia, reassures me. \"They can\u0027t track us. We\u0027re safe. We\u0027re alive!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Raz isn\u0027t,\" I note quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNadia\u0027s smile dims. \"That was a shame. I liked Raz.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what about Beranabus and Sharmila?\" I ask, guilt setting in. \"We ran out. Left them to the demons. We should go back and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Nadia snaps. \"No going back.\" Her eyes glitter. I take a step backwards - she looks like she\u0027s going to attack. She notices my fear and relaxes. \"Don\u0027t worry. I won\u0027t hurt you. But we\u0027re not going back. We couldn\u0027t do any good if we did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But... the others?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugs. \"Beranabus will probably survive. He\u0027s come through worse. He\u0027ll wriggle free somehow. As for Sharmila...\" She sighs. \"Maybe Beranabus will save her. Maybe not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stands and looks at the sky. Lightly runs a finger across her cheeks, caressing the spots and acne scars. \"It\u0027s warm. Must be late spring or summer. Maybe it\u0027s June. That\u0027s my favourite month. It\u0027s when I was born and when Beranabus took me. I was out walking, a perfect June day, dreaming about my birthday, presents and the future. Looking forward to growing up. I was a plain child, dowdy. But my father said I was an ugly duckling, that I\u0027d turn into a beautiful, glamorous swan one day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was thinking about that - longing for it - when Beranabus spirited me away. Dropped me into the universe of the Demonata. Explained how important I was, all the lives I could save, the good I could do. Offered me no choice. Robbed me of my dreams of a happy future.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNadia\u0027s expression darkens. \"He shouldn\u0027t have taken me so young. I hadn\u0027t seen enough of the world. If he\u0027d come when I was older, I\u0027d have joined him gladly. But taking me like he did... stealing me like that demon stole your brother... it was wrong. Don\u0027t you agree, Kernel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at her uncertainly. Now that she\u0027s mentioned Art, it drives home the fact that I didn\u0027t just run out on Beranabus and Sharmila. I deserted my brother too. Left him in that nightmarish universe. Alone in the hands of Cadaver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to go back,\" I say softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNadia doesn\u0027t hear - or pretends she doesn\u0027t. \"I wonder where we are?\" she says brightly. \"London? New York? Paris? Vienna? The world\u0027s changed so much since I left, I suppose I wouldn\u0027t recognise the cities I visited when I was younger. But there must be parts which are the same. I hope this is - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nadia,\" I interrupt. \"We have to go back. Find them. Help them if they\u0027re still fighting, link up with them if they\u0027ve escaped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if they\u0027re dead?\" she answers, not looking at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Search for Art by ourselves, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs. \"You\u0027re brave but stupid, Kernel. You wouldn\u0027t last five minutes in that universe without Beranabus. You\u0027re good at opening windows but not at fighting. What would you do if you caught up with Cadaver? He\u0027d rip you to shreds without breaking a sweat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But... Art... I have to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your brother\u0027s dead,\" Nadia growls. \"Cadaver probably killed him on that first world and fed his body to one of the trees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I moan. \"He\u0027s alive. I sense it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to sense it,\" she corrects me. \"You want him to be alive, so you\u0027ve convinced yourself he is. But think about it. Why wouldn\u0027t Cadaver kill him? He was on the run. He wouldn\u0027t have time to play nursemaid to a squalling baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA kid on a skateboard turns into the alley and whizzes past us. Nadia stares at the skateboard, head cocked, probably in much the same way that I stared when I first saw a demon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve missed so much,\" she mutters. \"The world\u0027s moved on while I\u0027ve been fighting. So many places to see. So many things to do. Is it true you can fly anywhere now, in aeroplanes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nadia,\" I try again, \"Beranabus needs us. We can\u0027t abandon him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" she retorts. \"You\u0027ve only known him five minutes. He treated you like a slave, the way he treats everyone. What do you owe him? Why throw your life away on his account?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need him to help get Art back. I can\u0027t - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop talking about your brother like he\u0027s alive!\" Nadia shouts. \"Let him go. Admit he\u0027s dead. Move on. You can go home - I\u0027ll help find your parents. Forget about the Demonata. Pretend it was a bad dream. That\u0027s what I\u0027m going to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t,\" I say stubbornly. \"Art\u0027s alive and I\u0027m going to find him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll go back?\" she asks mockingly. \"Face the demons? Die like Raz? You didn\u0027t know what you were stepping into when you followed us through the first window. Now you\u0027re better informed. Do you really have the courage to cross universes freely?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to,\" I mutter. \"For Art.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so,\" Nadia says coldly. \"You ran. The time to fight has passed. You feel guilty because you didn\u0027t stand by Beranabus and you want to put things right. But if you think it through, you\u0027ll see that\u0027s madness. You don\u0027t want to go back. And you won\u0027t. You\u0027ll stay in this universe, where you\u0027re safe. Like me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at the ground, tears creeping down my cheeks. Everything she says is true. I am afraid. I don\u0027t want to go back. I\u0027m a coward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut despite all my weaknesses, I have to return. Because I love Art more than I fear demons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come with me,\" Nadia says, taking my hands. She\u0027s smiling, looking prettier than normal, hair shining in the sun. \"I\u0027ll take you back to your parents if you want or you can stay with me. I\u0027ll be a sister to you. We can travel the world together. I\u0027ll use my gift to make money. We\u0027ll stay in the best hotels, sail the seas on mighty liners, fly through the sky on aeroplanes. Anything you want, I\u0027ll give you. It will be a precious life. No worries, no fears, no demons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head slowly. \"I can\u0027t,\" I croak. \"Art\u0027s my brother. I can\u0027t abandon him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNadia scowls and releases my hands. \"Have it your own way, fool! But when you\u0027re dying beneath some hideous demon, watching it reel your guts out like a cat playing with a ball of string, remember what I offered you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turns on her heel and marches away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nadia!\" I cry. \"Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There,\" she says, waving a hand at the world in general.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t leave me,\" I wail. \"I don\u0027t know where we are. You have to help me find Beranabus. You can go after that, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turns a corner and storms out of sight, leaving me in the alley. Alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sitting on the dusty ground. Hands on my knees. Head on my hands. Crying. It\u0027s been maybe an hour since Nadia left. I kept thinking she\u0027d come back, that she\u0027d decide she couldn\u0027t desert me. But there\u0027s been no sign of her. And the more I think about what she said, and her face when she said it, the less chance I think there is of her returning. Nadia hated her life with Beranabus. She went along with him because she had no other choice. But then I gave her a way out and she leapt at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually, when the tears stop, I get to my feet and look around. I feel hungry now that I\u0027m back in my own world, but there\u0027s no time to eat. I have to find Beranabus - if he\u0027s still alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are dozens of patches of light hanging in the air around me, but none are pulsing. I wipe my cheeks clean, then focus. \"Beranabus,\" I mutter, thinking about his face, his shabby suit, the flower in the buttonhole, his clean hands. I repeat his name, over and over, waiting for the lights to pulse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happens. The lights maintain their steady glow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI go cold - maybe that means he\u0027s dead!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Art,\" I say quickly, fixing my brother\u0027s features in my mind. I concentrate on his name and face, but the lights don\u0027t change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach\u0027s tight with fear. Are they both dead, slaughtered by demons? They must be. Otherwise, why wouldn\u0027t the lights pulse and lead me to them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have another thought, just before panic sets in completely. I visualise Cadaver\u0027s horrible features and say the demon\u0027s name, time and time again. Nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fear drains out of me as I realise the lights work differently here. They don\u0027t pulse when I think of a person or place. The magician and my brother might still be alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelief floods through me - then drains almost immediately. Because if the lights don\u0027t work the same way here, how will I find Beranabus or Art, or open a window to the universe of the Demonata?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t get back. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/demon-thief-the-demonata-2/page-12.html","bookId":2176,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:43:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:43:22 PM"}
