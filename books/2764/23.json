{"id":85618,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"In the Middle East, nothing has ever been simple,\" Avi says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" Tarik agrees. \"We are both strong people in our beliefs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shift uncomfortably on the pillow. \"If you saw Avi on the battlefield, would you kill him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTarik looks straight at Avi and says in a bold voice, \"Yes. And I would expect no less from him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi leans forward and takes my hand in his. \"I brought you here to show you we\u0027re not all filled with hatred and here you are asking if two friends would kill each other. Way to make this meeting turn around, sweetheart. Listen, we both do what we have to do to survive. It\u0027s our way of life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stay at Tarik\u0027s house for a little while longer, the guys laughing about school and their families and asking me about my friends back home. They stopped the political discussion; it seems like they know their limits in talking about it. It feels good to discuss stuff without feeling like I have to act a certain way or answer a certain way to fit in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like Tarik. And I have newfound respect for Avi because I know he puts aside his political beliefs and befriends Tarik because he\u0027s a guy with a good heart and mind. The news makes it look so different from the reality; I think news programs should show the positive sides of people instead of focusing on the negative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we\u0027re ready to leave, Tarik gives me a hug goodbye and says, \"Take care of my friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, I feel like a weight is on my shoulders now. Life in Israel is hard compared to the teenage life in America. Our biggest worries back home are what movie to go see or what outfit we\u0027re going to buy. And after high school, we obsess about what college we\u0027ll get into. September Eleventh changed our lives, but we still have it easier than the people in the Middle East.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsraelis don\u0027t even go to college after high school. They have to put their lives on the line and enter the army. Take care of my friend, Tarik just said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s not as easy as one might think, especially when that statement comes from a guy who is on the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy own life and the way I\u0027ve pushed Ron away flashes before my eyes and I feel a little sick. I do have a family here in Israel, maybe I should act like I care about them. If Avi and Tarik can care about each other, maybe I can find a little piece of my heart to love Ron. And Safta. And, dare I even think it, Snotty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, Osnat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what if they disappoint me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch as Avi and Tarik shake hands and slap each other on the back. A smile crosses my face. Because I know, even if they don\u0027t, they would protect each other with all of their power even if face to face on the battlefield. Both of these guys have pure, true spirits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeace between the Israelis and Palestinians? Who knows? Anything is possible. Maybe, just maybe, the friendship between these two strong-willed guys is a sign of hope for the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 28\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a lot to learn by venturing off the beaten path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you meet Tarik?\" I ask as we\u0027re driving back to the hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s just say I helped him when he needed a friend, and he did the same.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad you took me to meet him,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here with me,\" he says, then adds, \"I knew you wouldn\u0027t believe me if I told you not all Israelis hate Palestinians. You\u0027re the kind of girl who needs proof. You shouldn\u0027t rely on television so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t trust people in general.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet if you did it would open your eyes to a more colorful world out there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably. But at least I don\u0027t get let down too often because I already expect people are going to disappoint me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slows the car and stops it on the side of the road. Then he turns to me. \"I want to thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly my mouth is dry. \"For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For making me remember there\u0027s a world out here worth living.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did I do that?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the first person to make the pain of my brother\u0027s death bearable.\" He kisses me, right here in the car on the side of the barren desert road. \"When I\u0027m with you, I\u0027m whole again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile, inside and out. But I\u0027m embarrassed so I look down and finger the heavy silver chain hanging from his wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want it?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you want to give it to me,\" I say back shyly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes it off and fastens it to my wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s like you\u0027re telling everyone you\u0027re mine,\" he says. \"At least for now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean toward Avi and recapture his lips with mine. Like before, his kisses are drugging me and I\u0027m feeling dreamy and lightheaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I realize it, I\u0027m lying on top of him. I can feel his hard body under me, the warmth and strength of his muscles beneath mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should stop,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nibble on his ear and say, \"Uh huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe throws his head back and moans. \"I mean it, Amy. We\u0027re in a rental car on the side of the road.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time I lick a path from his earlobe to his mouth. \"Uh huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to wear me down, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uhhuh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like the way I make him feel when we\u0027re together. I also really like the wild sensations running through my body right now, too, as I move my body against his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I feel him start to give in to my hands and mouth, I stop and sit up. I mean, we\u0027re in public and anyone could just peek in the window. Would the windows steam up if we continued? I didn\u0027t think it could get hotter in the car than outside, but I\u0027m feeling pretty toasty even though the air conditioning is on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe licks his lips slowly and opens his eyes. \"I can\u0027t move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh. \"Did I make you forget to be angry all the time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Definitely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I can do this forever if it\u0027ll make you happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers move to my shoulder and he slides the strap on my tank down. \"I wish ...\" he says, leaning his head forward and lightly kissing my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know what he wants to say. I want him to say it, but then I remember our little agreement. No getting too involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo bad, I\u0027m already so into him it\u0027s scary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I know he would regret it if we did go too far. And we are, in fact, parked on the side of a road. \"If you don\u0027t stop kissing me like that, I\u0027m going to rip all your clothes off,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little moan escapes from his mouth and he leans back. \"I\u0027m crazy about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Remember that when some pretty Israeli girl hits on you after I\u0027m gone. Now let\u0027s get back to the others, or I really am going to follow through with my threat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA half hour later, when we turn onto the road leading to the hotel, Avi says, \"So what\u0027s the story with your parents?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe asks me this loaded question and I turn toward the window. \"I don\u0027t want to talk about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? Lots of parents get divorced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, only my parents were never married to begin with. Try telling that story to your peers at school. I always feel they think my mom just slept with a random guy in college and got pregnant. And the sucky part about it is, it\u0027s not far from the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about your parents,\" I counter. \"I never hear much about them from Ron or my aunt and uncle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s not much to tell. My mom works as a teacher on the moshav and my father is your uncle\u0027s partner. Okay, your turn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a deep breath. \"My parents were never married and I should never have been born. I was, shall we say, a mistake. A very big sixteen-year-old mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere, I said it. My face is hot and my eyes are watery. I\u0027m holding myself together as best I can under the circumstances. I\u0027ve thought about my life and what a mistake it is about a million times. I\u0027ve never actually voiced it aloud before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe arrive at the hotel and Avi parks the car in the parking lot. \"I\u0027m not a very religious guy,\" he says, \"but I know there\u0027s a very important reason you were born.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound like a rabbi,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m just a sheep farmer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Avi, you are SO much more than that and you know it,\" I lean back in the passenger seat and sigh. \"I don\u0027t want today to end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flashes me one of his dazzling smiles. \"Me either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look into his eyes and he holds my gaze for a long minute. We don\u0027t say anything more, there\u0027s no words that can say what I want to say to him. Or are there? \"Avi--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shh,\" he whispers, covering my lips with his fingers. \"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reluctantly get out of the car and head for the lobby of the hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the gang is waiting for us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I spot Snotty ...make that Osnat ...sitting alone in the corner, I go up to her. \"I\u0027m sorry I said you wear short shirts, tight pants, and have a sorry excuse for breasts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOsnat shakes her head in confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shift my feet and look at the ground. \"I mean, you do wear tight pants ...and your breasts are smaller than mine. But they\u0027re lovely breasts. And I\u0027m sure it\u0027s the style in Israel to have tight pants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyebrows are raised as she says, \"Are you trying to apologize to me? If you are, you\u0027re doing a lousy job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open my arms out wide and say, \"Give me a break here, I\u0027m not used to being all gushy and apologetic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOsnat stands up and says, \"I\u0027m sorry I said your breasts sag. Your sagging breasts aren\u0027t bad, either.\" Then she holds her hand out for me to shake it. \"Truce?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait just one itty-bitty second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never told me my breasts sag!\" I say, ignoring her fake truce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to your face, I didn\u0027t,\" she admits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I deserved the insult. And I\u0027ll keep to myself I\u0027ve called her Snotty almost since I met her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both start laughing hysterically and everybody else is looking at us like we\u0027re mashed potatoes. Two mashed potato cousins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we go for a walk?\" she asks, bure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe exit the hotel and start walking aimlessly in the parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kick a rock down the road as I walk. \"I didn\u0027t want to come to Israel this summer,\" I say. \"And I didn\u0027t want to like anyone here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kicks the same rock, continuing its journey down the road. \"And I was shocked Ron had a secret daughter. I guess in some way I was jealous of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe? A secret daughter? Being thought of as a secret sure beats being thought of as illegitimate. \"Believe me, you have nothing to be jealous about. At least you have parents who love each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Ron has the best job ever. You must be so proud of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, so you\u0027re probably wondering what Ron does for a living. All I know is he\u0027s in the security business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s no big deal,\" I say. After all, everybody\u0027s in the security business these days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOsnat pulls my shoulder back and stops me from walking. \"Are you kidding?\" she says. \"My mom told me he\u0027s been hired as a consultant to the Director of Homeland Security in the U.S.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat? I didn\u0027t know that. I guess I never even asked him. I\u0027ve been too busy being pissed off at him for not being Superdad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, he doesn\u0027t talk about it much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He probably can\u0027t because it\u0027s classified.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m having a hard time thinking of Ron as a super-security consultant hired by the U.S. government. After all, I\u0027m used to thinking of him as the Sperm Donor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOsnat turns to me and says, \"You didn\u0027t know what he did until I told you, right?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1/page-23.html","bookId":2764,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:04 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:04 PM"}
