He had an only son, Orton Campbell, now a young man of twenty-eight. He was young in years only, being a stiff, grave, wooden-faced man, who in his starched manners was a close copy of his father. Both father and son were excessively fond of money, and the large amount of the fortune of the young lady, who stood to the father in the relation of ward, had excited the covetousness of both. It was almost immediately arranged between father and son[Pg 159] that she should marry the latter, either of her own free will or upon compulsion.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In pursuance of this agreement, Mr. Orton Campbell took advantage of the ward\u0027s residence in his father\u0027s family to press upon her attentions which clearly indicated his ultimate object.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Florence Douglas felt at first rather constrained to receive her guardian\u0027s son with politeness, and this, being misinterpreted, led to an avowal of love.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Orton Campbell made his proposal in a confident, matter-of-fact manner, as if it were merely a matter of form, and the answer must necessarily be favorable.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The young lady drew back in dignified surprise, hastily withdrawing the hand which he had seized. \"I cannot understand, Mr. Campbell,\" she said, \"what can have induced you to address me in this manner.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know why you should be surprised, Miss Douglas,\" returned Orton Campbell, offended.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have never given you any reason to suppose that I regarded you with favor.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 160]\"You have always seemed glad to see me, but perhaps that was only coquetry,\" said Orton, in a disagreeable manner.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I certainly have never treated you with more than ordinary politeness, except, indeed, as my residence in your father\u0027s house has necessarily brought us nearer together.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t think, Miss Douglas, you would find me a bad match,\" said the young man, condescending to drop his sneering tone and plead his cause. \"I am already worth a good sum of money. I am my father\u0027s partner, and I shall become richer every year.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It is not a matter of money with me, Mr. Campbell.

I should offer myself to you if you had nothing.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This Florence Douglas thoroughly disbelieved. She answered coldly, \"I thank you for the compliment you pay me, but I beg you to drop the subject.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will wait.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You will wait in vain.
