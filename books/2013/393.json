But it did not last long, not long at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not know why he was thinking about his brother now, as he set ablaze every candle within him to make the world bright and to save all his friends. And before long he no longer sensed anyone else, barring the faint smudges they had become. The captain, the Fist, all the soldiers who were his friends, he let his light unfold to embrace them all, to keep them safe from that frightening, dark magic so eager to rush down upon them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had grown too powerful for those seven mages to contain. They had created something that would now destroy them, but Beak would not let it hurt his friends. And so he made his light burn yet brighter. He made of it a solid thing. Would it be enough? He did not know, but it had to be, for without friends there was nothing, no-one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrighter, hotter, so hot the wax of the candles burst into clouds of droplets, flaring bright as the sun, one after another. And, when every coloured candle was lit, why, there was white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet more, for as each joined the torrent emanating from him, he felt in himself a cleansing, a scouring away, what priests called purification only they really knew nothing about purification because it had nothing to do with offerings of blood or coin and nothing to do with starving yourself and whipping your own back or endlessly chanting until the brain goes numb. Nothing like any of that. Purification, Beak now understood, was final.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything glowed, as if lit from fires within. The once-black stubble of crops blazed back into fierce life. Stones shone like precious gems. Incandescence raged on all sides. Fiddler saw his soldiers and he could see through, in pulsing flashes, to their very bones, the organs huddled within their cages. He saw, along one entire side of Koryk, old fractures on the ribs, the left arm, the shoulder blade, the hip. He saw three knuckle-sized dents on Cuttle’s skull beneath the now translucent helm-a rap he had taken when still a babe, soft-boned and vulnerable. He saw the damage between Smiles’s legs from all the times she savaged herself. He saw in Corabb Bhilan Thenu’alas the coursing blood that held in it the power to destroy every cancer that struck him, and he was a man under siege from that disease, but it would never kill. Would not even sicken him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw in Bottle coruscating waves of raw power, a refulgence devoid of all control-but that would come. It will come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCorporal Tarr crouched down in the hole he’d dug, and the light emanating from him looked solid as iron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong the others he saw more than any mortal would want to see, yet he could hot close his eyes, could not look away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler and Stormy were lit in gold fire. Even Stormy’s beard and hair-all spun gold now-a brutal beauty cascading round his face, and the damned fool was laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world beyond had vanished behind an opaque, curved wall of silver fire. Vague shapes on the other side-yes, he’d seen the Tiste Edur approaching, seeking some kind of shelter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiddler found he was standing, facing that wall, and now he was walking forward. Because some things matter more than others. Stepping into that silver fire, feeling it lance through his entire body, neither hot nor cold, neither pain nor joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe staggered suddenly, blinking, and not fifteen paces from him crouched hundreds of Tiste Edur. Waiting to die. * * *\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanradi knelt with his gaze fixed on the sky, half of which had vanished behind a blackened wall of writhing madness. The crest had begun its toppling advance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSudden motion drew his eyes down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo see a Malazan-now transformed into an apparition of white-beard, hair-the dangling finger bones were now polished, luminous, as was his armour, his weapons. Scoured, polished, even the leather of his harness looked new, supple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Malazan met his gaze with silver eyes, then he lifted one perfect hand, and waved them all forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanradi rose, flinging his sword aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis warriors saw. His warriors did the same, and as they all moved forward, the dome of silver fire all at once rushed towards them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA piercing shriek and Hanradi turned to see his last K’risnan burst into flames-a single blinding instant, then the hapless warlock was simply ash, settling onto the ground-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeak was happy to save them. He had understood that old sergeant. The twisted mage, alas, could not embrace such purification. Too much of his soul had been surrendered. The others-oh, they were wounded, filled with bitterness that he needed to sweep away, and so he did. Nothing was difficult any more. Nothing-At that moment, the wave of Letherii magic descended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Letherii commander could not see the killing field, could indeed see nothing but that swirling, burgeoning wall of eager sorcery. Its cruel hunger poured down in hissing clouds. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-393.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
