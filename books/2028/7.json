It took less than a second, and the whole time I was waiting for the pain to get me. For the flames to hit and then spread like the night I\u0027d met her, only faster. The dazzling flash of light was gone. It was just the pil ar of sun again. I looked at Diego\u0027s face - his eyes were wide, his mouth hanging open. He was total y stil, a sure sign of alarm. I wanted to look down at my leg, but I was afraid to see what was left. This wasn\u0027t like Jen ripping my arm off, though that had hurt more. I wasn\u0027t going to be able to fix this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStil no pain yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bree, did you see that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head once quickly. \"How bad is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My leg,\" I said through my teeth. \"Just tel me what\u0027s left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your leg looks fine to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced down quickly, and sure enough, there was my foot and my calf, just like before. I wiggled my toes. Fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it hurt?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pul ed myself off the ground, onto my knees. \"Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you see what happened? The light?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch this,\" he said, kneeling in front of the beam of sunshine again. \"And don\u0027t shove me out of the way this time. You already proved I\u0027m right.\" He put his hand out. It was almost as hard to watch this time, even if my leg felt normal. The second his fingers entered the beam, the cave was fil ed with a mil ion bril iant rainbow reflections. It was bright as noon in a glass room - light everywhere. I flinched and then shuddered. There was sunlight all over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unreal,\" Diego whispered. He put the rest of his hand into the beam, and the cave somehow got even brighter. He rol ed his hand over to look at the back, then turned it palm up again. The reflections danced like he was spinning a prism. There was no smel of burning, and he clearly wasn\u0027t in pain. I looked closely at his hand, and it seemed like there were a zil ion tiny mirrors in the surface, too smal to distinguish separately, al shining back the light with double the intensity of a regular mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come here, Bree - you have to try this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t think of a reason to refuse, and I was curious, but I was also stil reluctant as I slid to his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No burn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None. Light doesn\u0027t burn us, it just... reflects off of us. I guess that\u0027s kind of an understatement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlow as a human, I reluctantly stretched my fingers into the light. Immediately, reflections blazed away from my skin, making the room so bright that the day outside would look dark in comparison. They weren\u0027t exactly reflections, though, because the light was bent and colored, more like crystal. I stuck my whole hand in, and the room got brighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think Riley knows?\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. Maybe not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why wouldn\u0027t he tel us if he did? What would be the point?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo we\u0027re walking disco bal s.\" I shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiego laughed. \"I can see where the stories come from. Imagine if you saw this when you were human. Wouldn\u0027t you think that the guy over there just burst into flames?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he didn\u0027t hang around to chat. Maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is incredible,\" Diego said. With one finger he traced a line across my glowing palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he jumped to his feet right under the sunbeam, and the room went crazy with light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"C\u0027mon, let\u0027s get out of here.\" He reached up and pul ed himself toward the hole he\u0027d cut to the surface. You\u0027d think I would have been over it, but I was stil nervous to fol ow. Not wanting to seem like a total chicken, I stayed close on his heels, but I was cringing inside the whole way. Riley had real y made his point about burning in the sun; in my mind it was linked to that horrific time of burning as I became a vampire, and I couldn\u0027t escape the instinctive panic that fil ed me every time I thought of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Diego was out of the hole, and I was next to him half a second later. We stood on a smal patch of wild grass, only a few feet from the trees that covered the island. Behind us, it was just a couple of yards to a low bluff, and then the water. Everything around us blazed in the color and light shining off of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiego grinned at me, his face beautiful with light, and suddenly, with a deep lurch in my stomach, I realized that the whole BFF thing was way off the mark. For me, anyway. It was just that fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grin softened a little bit into just the hint of a smile. His eyes were wide like mine. Al awe and lights. He touched my face, the way he\u0027d touched my hand, as if he was trying to understand the shine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So pretty,\" he said. He left his hand against my cheek. I\u0027m not sure how long we stood there, smiling like total idiots, blazing away like glass torches. The inlet was empty of boats, which was probably good. No way even a mud-eyed human would have missed us. Not that they could have done anything to us, but I wasn\u0027t thirsty, and al the screaming would have ruined the mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventual y a thick cloud drifted in front of the sun. Suddenly we were just us again, though stil slightly luminous. Not enough that anyone with eyes dul er than a vampire\u0027s would notice. As soon as the shine was gone, my thoughts cleared up and I could think about what was coming next. But even though Diego looked like his normal self again - not made of blazing light, anyway - I knew he would never look the same to me. That tingly sensation in the pit of my stomach was stil there. I had the feeling it might be there permanently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do we tel Riley? Do we think he doesn\u0027t know?\" I asked. Diego sighed and dropped his hand. \"I don\u0027t know. Let\u0027s think about this while we track them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to have to be careful, tracking them in the day. We\u0027re kind of noticeable in the sunlight, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"Let\u0027s be ninjas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"Super-secret ninja club sounds way cooler than the whole BFF thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Definitely better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t take us more than a few seconds to find the point from which the whole gang had left the island. That was the easy part. Finding where they\u0027d touched ground on the mainland was a whole other problem. We briefly discussed splitting up, then vetoed that idea unanimously. Our logic was real y sound - after al, if one of us found something, how would we tel the other? - but mostly I just didn\u0027t want to leave him, and I could see he felt the same. Both of us had been without any kind of good companionship our whole lives, and it was just too sweet to waste a minute of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were so many options as to where they could have gone. To the mainland of the peninsula, or to another island, or back to the outskirts of Seattle, or north to Canada. Whenever we pul ed down or burned down one of our houses, Riley was always prepared - he always seemed to know exactly where to go next. He must have planned ahead for that stuff, but he didn\u0027t let any of us in on the plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey could have been anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDucking in and out of the water to avoid boats and people real y slowed us down. We spent al day with no luck, but neither of us minded. We were having the most fun we\u0027d ever had. It was such a strange day. Instead of sitting miserably in the darkness trying to tune out the mayhem and swal ow my disgust at my hiding place, I was playing ninja with my new best friend, or maybe something more. We laughed a lot while we moved through the patches of shade, throwing rocks at each other like they were Chinese stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the sun set, and suddenly I was stressed. Would Riley look for us? Would he assume we were fried? Did he know better?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe started moving faster. A lot faster. We\u0027d already circled al the nearby islands, so now we concentrated on the mainland. About an hour after sundown, I caught a familiar scent, and within seconds we were on their trail. Once we found the path of the smel, it was as easy as fol owing a herd of elephants through fresh snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe talked about what to do, more serious now as we ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think we should tel Riley,\" I said. \"Let\u0027s say we spent al day in your cave before we went looking for them.\" As I spoke, my paranoia started to grow. \"Better yet, let\u0027s tel them your cave was fil ed with water. We couldn\u0027t even talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think Riley\u0027s a bad dude, don\u0027t you?\" he asked quietly after a minute. As he spoke, he took my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. But I\u0027d rather act like he was, just in case.\" I hesitated, then said, \"You don\u0027t want to think he\u0027s bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Diego admitted. \"He\u0027s kind of my friend. I mean, not like you\u0027re my friend.\" He squeezed my fingers. \"But more than anyone else. I don\u0027t want to think...\" Diego didn\u0027t finish his sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI squeezed his fingers back. \"Maybe he\u0027s total y decent. Our being careful doesn\u0027t change who he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True. Okay, the underwater cave story it is. At least at first...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could talk to him about the sun later. I\u0027d rather do it during the day, anyway, when I can prove what I\u0027m claiming right away. And just in case he already knows, but there\u0027s some good reason why he told us something else, I should tel him when we\u0027re alone. Grab him at dawn, when he\u0027s coming back from wherever it is he goes....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI noticed a ton of I\u0027s rather than we\u0027s going on in Diego\u0027s little speech, and it bothered me. But at the same time, I didn\u0027t want much to do with educating Riley. I didn\u0027t have the same faith in him Diego did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ninja attack at dawn!\" I said to make him laugh. It worked. We started joking again as we tracked our herd of vampires, but I could tel he was thinking serious stuff under the teasing, just like I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I only got more anxious as we ran. Because we were running fast, and there was no way we had the wrong trail, but it was taking too long. We were real y getting away from the coast, up and over the closest mountains, off into new territory. This wasn\u0027t the normal pattern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery house we\u0027d borrowed, whether it was up a mountain or on an island or hidden on a big farm, had a few things in common. The dead owners, the remote locale, and one other thing. They al were sort of focused on Seattle. Oriented around the big city like orbiting moons. Seattle was always the hub, always the target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were out of orbit now, and it felt wrong. Maybe it meant nothing, maybe it was just that so many things were changing today. Al the truths I\u0027d accepted had been turned upside down and I wasn\u0027t in the mood for any other upheavals. Why couldn\u0027t Riley have just picked someplace normal?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Funny they\u0027re this far out,\" Diego murmured, and I could hear the edge in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or scary,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe squeezed my hand. \"It\u0027s cool. The ninja club can handle anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got a secret handshake yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Working on it,\" he promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething started to bug me. It was like I could feel this strange blind spot - I knew there was something I wasn\u0027t seeing, but I couldn\u0027t put my finger on it. Something obvious...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, about sixty miles farther west than our usual perimeter, we found the house. It was impossible to mistake the noise. The boom boom boom of the bass, the video-game soundtrack, the snarling. Total y our crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pul ed my hand free, and Diego looked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, I don\u0027t even know you,\" I said in a joking tone. \"I haven\u0027t had one conversation with you, what with al that water we sat in al day. You could be a ninja or a vampire for al I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"Same goes for you, stranger.\" Then low and fast, \"Just do the same things you did yesterday. Tomorrow night we\u0027l get out together. Maybe do some reconnaissance, figure out more of what\u0027s going on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like a plan. Mum\u0027s the word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ducked close and kissed me - just a peck, but right on the lips. The shock of it zinged through my whole body. Then he said, \"Let\u0027s do this,\" and headed down the side of the mountain toward the source of the raucous noise without looking back. Already playing the part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA little stunned, I fol owed from a few yards behind, remembering to put the distance between us that I would put between myself and anyone else. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-short-second-life-of-bree-tanner-twilight-4/page-7.html","bookId":2028,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:18:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:18:47 PM"}
