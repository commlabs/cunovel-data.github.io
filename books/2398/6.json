Once upon a time, Nisha had been friends with Sutton—or at least friendly enough to invite her to a birthday party, friendly enough to skate arm in arm with her. It looked like Nisha had put it up recently, after she’d started hanging out with Emma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment I heard a distant sound of childish laughter echoing down the corridors of my memory. That day at the ice rink, Nisha and I had tried to teach ourselves some of the tricks we’d seen during the Olympics. Michelle Kwan made toe loops look so easy, but we spent most of our time falling flat on our butts and laughing at ourselves. I couldn’t remember why we’d ended up hating each other so much. Maybe it had just been that we were similar in all the wrong ways. We wanted the same things, and we were both willing to fight for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma climbed back to her feet and sighed. If there had ever been any evidence here, it was already in the hands of the killer. After all, Sutton’s murderer had been a step ahead of her since she first arrived in Tucson. Why would this time be any different?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood in the doorway, sweeping her gaze one more time around Nisha’s bedroom. Good-bye, Nisha, she thought. I’m so sorry you got pulled into this. She turned off the light and started the long walk back down the hallway. At the kitchen door she drew to a sudden stop, biting the corner of her lip. Then, impulsively, she went to the counter and started to gather the empty food containers. She found a roll of paper towels under the sink and wiped the counters down, then loaded the dishwasher, moving as quietly as she could. Somewhere in the house she could hear the low murmur of a television set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she stuffed the takeout boxes into a garbage bag and carried it with her, past the night-light, past the beautiful furniture and the brightly colored tapestries and the elegant vases and all the other things that Dr. Banerjee had shared, once upon a time, with his family—back into the darkness beyond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood-bye, Nisha. I added my farewell to my sister’s. I promise, whoever did this to us is going to pay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHER CHEATING HEART\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the final bell rang the next day at school, Emma slowly gathered her books from her locker. She wasn’t sure she was ready to face the tennis team, not yet. It would be an emotional practice. Emma blinked away a tear, looking at her reflection in the tiny mirror inside Sutton’s locker. Pull it together, she commanded herself, and slammed the door shut. Then she did a double take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThayer Vega was standing there, waiting to talk to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dead-girl heart gave a lurch at the sight of him. A gray henley shirt pulled tight across his muscular chest. His dark hair hung down over one eye, and his backpack was slung casually over his shoulder. Thayer had been the only boy I’d ever loved, the one person who really knew me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” Emma said, hugging her books to her chest and giving him a shaky smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the past month, she and Thayer had started to establish a cautious friendship. He was a good listener, and when Becky showed up in Emma’s life again, he was one of the few people she felt safe telling. She’d started to think the two of them could put his relationship with Sutton behind them and be friends—until he kissed her at Charlotte’s party two weeks ago. She’d pulled away, but not before he had a chance to realize something was wrong. He’d confronted her two days later, saying he knew something was off about her; and while she’d managed to dismiss his accusations, she knew he was still suspicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wave of relief swept over her as she remembered Mrs. Mercer’s plea to keep the news about Becky’s other daughter a secret—if Thayer found out that Sutton had a long-lost twin, Emma had a feeling it wouldn’t take long for him to figure out who she really was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” he said, hefting the backpack farther across his back. “Are you heading out to the courts?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not in any hurry,” she said, smiling ruefully. “It’s going to be like a second funeral.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I get that.” He searched her face for a moment. “How are you holding up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me? I’m okay.” Emma’s voice sounded too high in her ears, strained and anxious. He just looked at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, I’ll walk with you to the locker rooms,” Thayer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you guys have a good Thanksgiving?” Emma asked, trying to make small talk as they paced down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave a bitter bark of laughter. “The usual. Mom burned the turkey, and Dad threw a wineglass at her. Mads and I ended up sneaking out and getting Burger King.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him a sympathetic look. Thayer’s family was at best volatile, and at worst downright abusive. “Sorry, Thayer. That sounds awful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. “It was par for the course around Casa Vega. And neither of us was in much mood for family time anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma nodded. “Yeah. Mom and Dad cooked a big turkey dinner because they’d already bought the groceries and they didn’t want it to go to waste, but they should have just stuck everything in the freezer. No one had much appetite. Except Drake,” she added, smiling at the memory of the Great Dane, who’d casually sauntered past a countertop and inhaled a platter of sweet potatoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe halls were mostly empty by now, with the exception of a few drama kids wearing black robes for the school production of The Crucible. A pimply boy carrying a tuba hurried out of the music wing and disappeared through the doors leading to the football field.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they crossed the flagstones of a small courtyard, Emma heard a dark chuckle from a bench in the corner. It was Garrett, his gaze pinned sharply on her. He was alone, his gear bag slouched on the ground next to him. His eyes were hard and angry, his lips twisted with bitter amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’d better not let Landry catch you sneaking around all buddy-buddy,” he said, sneering. “Although I could stand to watch him kick your ass again, Vega. I should have done it myself ages ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mind your own business, man,” Thayer shot back. He stood with his legs planted wide and crossed his arms over his chest. Emma tensed next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not in charge of who I hang out with, Garrett,” she snapped, recalling Laurel’s words. It sounded like he’d been more controlling than she would have guessed. Maybe, in the end, he hadn’t been able to control Sutton. Maybe it had driven him crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett gave her a long, cool look, his smile broadening slowly. “You are a piece of work, you know that? It’s almost like you believe your own lies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drew in her breath sharply. Once she would have thought he was just referring to Sutton’s infidelity. But maybe he meant Emma’s lies about being Sutton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThayer’s hands clenched into fists for a moment. Then he relaxed them, shaking his head slowly at Garrett. “Man, it’s over. This is pathetic even for you. Come on, Sutton.” He rested his hand gently on her back and steered her through the door to the athletics wing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma glanced at Thayer from the corner of her eye as they walked. His face was stormy, a brooding frown creasing his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bit her lip and took a deep breath. “You know Garrett knew about us, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThayer nodded. “I had a feeling. He’s said some weird stuff to me since I got back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Weird stuff?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just macho bullshit. Watch my back, that kind of thing.” Thayer shrugged. “I brushed it off at first. We’ve never exactly been friends. But he cornered me at the school break-in party a few weeks ago, drunk off his ass. He was pretty aggressive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma’s throat went dry. She stopped walking and touched his arm. He stared down at her fingers on his sleeve for a second too long, then glanced up to meet her eyes. “Thayer, do you remember anything at all about the face you saw through the windshield that night at Sabino?” she whispered. “Do you think it could have been Garrett?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Garrett?” He blinked in surprise. “I don’t know. I really couldn’t see anything, it was so dark.” His brow furrowed. “Do you have some reason to think it was him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, not other than how angry he’s been at both of us, I guess.” She sighed. “There are too many things in my life that don’t make any sense right now. I wish I had some answers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stopped in the sports lobby just outside of the locker rooms. Nisha’s senior portrait, blown up and framed with black velvet, hung on a corkboard next to the ticket office. In the picture her cobalt dress was bright against her dark skin. She gave the camera a serious look, obviously trying to appear like the dignified future Ivy Leaguer she imagined herself to be, but the photographer had somehow caught the ghost of a smile on her lips. All around the picture, people had pinned notes and cards, poems and song lyrics and messages in pink sparkly pen that Nisha would have mocked as far too girly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s just so awful,” Emma whispered. Thayer nodded, the corners of his mouth turning downward as he looked at the picture, too. She sighed. “Well, I’d better get changed. Thanks for . . . for walking with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThayer turned to look at her again, his gaze searching and intense, as though he was seeking something in her features but didn’t know what. Emma ducked away, suddenly afraid of Thayer’s hazel eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s weird,” he said quietly. “Something about you has really changed. Sometimes it feels like you turned into a whole new person while I was away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe I grew up,” Emma replied, her heart lurching nervously. “Or maybe you did, and you’re just seeing me differently.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThayer shook his head. “I don’t know much, Sutton, but I know nothing can change the way I feel about you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelief flooded my body—the boy I loved so desperately still loved me back. But it was tempered by a deep feeling of sadness. Thayer had so many more memories of our time together, whereas all I had were a few scattered scenes. Would I ever get those memories back?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmma’s breath felt strangely short. She glanced up at Thayer’s wounded and confused expression, then looked quickly away. “I have to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. Okay.” He shoved his hands into his pockets. “See you, Sutton.” He turned toward the glass double doors and walked away from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and I watched his retreating form together. I wanted to call out and stop him, to somehow let him know that I’m still here—and still in love with him. But he didn’t look back, not even once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE CANYON’S SECRET\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe humming sound of potters’ wheels provided a soothing background noise as Emma sat in the ceramics studio on Wednesday morning, struggling to attach a handle to a lopsided pitcher. She dipped her fingers into the bucket of slip she’d dredged from the vat at the back of the room and dabbed it carefully on her project. Madeline wrinkled her nose in distaste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You got some of that stuff on your jeans,” she said, pointing to a splotch on Emma’s thigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ugh. That’d better come out in the wash,” Emma grumbled, though she had bigger problems right now than cleaning Sutton’s J Brands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So where’s Laurel?” Madeline asked, looking around. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seven-minutes-in-heaven-the-lying-game-6/page-6.html","bookId":2398,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:03 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:29:03 AM"}
