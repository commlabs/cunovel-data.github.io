Dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTobias crouches in front of me, his hand on my left shoulder. The train car bumps over the rails, and Marcus, Peter, and Caleb stand by the doorway. I take a deep breath and hold it in an attempt to relieve some of the pressure that is building in my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour ago, nothing that happened felt real to me. Now it does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI breathe out, and the pressure is still there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tris, come on,” Tobias says, his eyes searching mine. “We have to jump.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is too dark to see where we are, but if we are getting off, we are probably close to the fence. Tobias helps me to my feet and guides me toward the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others jump off one by one: Peter first, then Marcus, then Caleb. I take Tobias’s hand. The wind picks up as we stand at the edge of the car opening, like a hand pushing me back, toward safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we launch ourselves into darkness and land hard on the ground. The impact hurts the bullet wound in my shoulder. I bite my lip to keep from crying out, and search for my brother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay?” I say when I see him sitting in the grass a few feet away, rubbing his knee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods. I hear him sniff like he’s fending off tears, and I have to turn away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe landed in the grass near the fence, several yards away from the worn path that the Amity trucks travel to deliver food to the city, and the gate that lets them out—the gate that is currently shut, locking us in. The fence towers over us, too high and flexible to climb over, too sturdy to knock down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are supposed to be Dauntless guards here,” says Marcus. “Where are they?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They were probably under the simulation,” Tobias says, “and are now . . .” He pauses. “Who knows where, doing who knows what.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stopped the simulation—the weight of the hard drive in my back pocket reminds me—but we didn’t pause to see the aftermath. What happened to our friends, our peers, our leaders, our factions? There is no way to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTobias approaches a small metal box on the right side of the gate and opens it, revealing a keypad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s hope the Erudite didn’t think to change this combination,” he says as he types in a series of numbers. He stops at the eighth one, and the gate clicks open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did you know that?” says Caleb. His voice sounds thick with emotion, so thick I am surprised it does not choke him on the way out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I worked in the Dauntless control room, monitoring the security system. We only change the codes twice a year,” Tobias says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How lucky,” says Caleb. He gives Tobias a wary look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Luck has nothing to do with it,” Tobias says. “I only worked there because I wanted to make sure I could get out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shiver. The way he talks about getting out—it’s like he thinks we’re trapped. I never thought about it that way before, and now that seems foolish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walk in a small pack, Peter cradling his bloody arm to his chest—the arm that I shot—and Marcus with his hand on Peter’s shoulder, keeping him stable. Caleb wipes his cheeks every few seconds, and I know he’s crying but I don’t know how to comfort him, or why I am not crying myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead I take the lead, Tobias silent at my side, and though he does not touch me, he steadies me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePinpricks of light are the first sign that we are nearing Amity headquarters. Then squares of light that turn into glowing windows. A cluster of wooden and glass buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we can reach them, we have to walk through an orchard. My feet sink into the ground, and above me, the branches grow into one another, forming a kind of tunnel. Dark fruit hangs among the leaves, ready to drop. The sharp, sweet smell of rotting apples mixes with the scent of wet earth in my nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we get close, Marcus leaves Peter’s side and walks in front. “I know where to go,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leads us past the first building to the second one on the left. All the buildings except the greenhouses are made of the same dark wood, unpainted, rough. I hear laughter through an open window. The contrast between the laughter and the stone stillness within me is jarring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus opens one of the doors. I would be shocked by the lack of security if we were not at Amity headquarters. They often straddle the line between trust and stupidity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this building the only sound is of our squeaking shoes. I don’t hear Caleb crying anymore, but then, he was quiet about it before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus stops before an open room, where Johanna Reyes, representative of Amity, sits, staring out the window. I recognize her because it is hard to forget Johanna’s face, whether you’ve seen her once or a thousand times. A scar stretches in a thick line from just above her right eyebrow to her lip, rendering her blind in one eye and giving her a lisp when she talks. I have only heard her speak once, but I remember. She would have been a beautiful woman if not for that scar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, thank God,” she says when she sees Marcus. She walks toward him with her arms open. Instead of embracing him, she just touches his shoulders, like she remembers the Abnegation’s distaste for casual physical contact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The other members of your party got here a few hours ago, but they weren’t sure if you had made it,” she says. She is referring to the group of Abnegation who were with my father and Marcus in the safe house. I didn’t even think to worry about them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks over Marcus’s shoulder, first at Tobias and Caleb, then at me, then at Peter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my,” she says, her eyes lingering on the blood soaking Peter’s shirt. “I’ll send for a doctor. I can grant you all permission to stay the night, but tomorrow, our community must decide together. And”—she eyes Tobias and me—“they will likely not be enthusiastic about a Dauntless presence in our compound. I of course ask you to turn over any weapons you might have.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder, suddenly, how she knows that I am Dauntless. I am still wearing a gray shirt. My father’s shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, his smell, which is an even mixture of soap and sweat, wafts upward, and it fills my nose, fills my entire head with him. I clench my hands so hard into fists that my fingernails cut into my skin. Not here. Not here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTobias hands over his gun, but when I reach behind me to take out my own concealed weapon, he grabs my hand, guiding it away from my back. Then he laces his fingers with mine to cover up what he just did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know it’s smart to keep one of our guns. But it would have been a relief to hand it over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My name is Johanna Reyes,” she says, extending her hand to me, and then Tobias. A Dauntless greeting. I am impressed by her awareness of the customs of other factions. I always forget how considerate the Amity are until I see it for myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is T—” Marcus starts, but Tobias interrupts him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My name is Four,” he says. “This is Tris, Caleb, and Peter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few days ago, “Tobias” was a name only I knew, among the Dauntless; it was the piece of himself that he gave me. Outside Dauntless headquarters, I remember why he hid that name from the world. It binds him to Marcus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Welcome to the Amity compound.” Johanna’s eyes fix on my face, and she smiles crookedly. “Let us take care of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe do let them. An Amity nurse gives me a salve—developed by Erudite to speed healing—to put on my shoulder, and then escorts Peter to the hospital ward to mend his arm. Johanna takes us to the cafeteria, where we find some of the Abnegation who were in the safe house with Caleb and my father. Susan is there, and some of our old neighbors, and rows of wooden tables as long as the room itself. They greet us—especially Marcus—with held-in tears and suppressed smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cling to Tobias’s arm. I sag under the weight of the members of my parents’ faction, their lives, their tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the Abnegation puts a cup of steaming liquid under my nose and says, “Drink this. It will help you sleep as it helped some of the others sleep. No dreams.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe liquid is pink-red, like strawberries. I grab the cup and drink it fast. For a few seconds the heat from the liquid makes me feel like I am full of something again. And as I drain the last drops from the cup, I feel myself relaxing. Someone leads me down the hallway, to a room with a bed in it. That is all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWO\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI OPEN MY eyes, terrified, my hands clutching at the sheets. But I am not running through the streets of the city or the corridors of Dauntless headquarters. I am in a bed in Amity headquarters, and the smell of sawdust is in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shift, and wince as something digs into my back. I reach behind me, and my fingers wrap around the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment I see Will standing before me, both our guns between us—his hand, I could have shot his hand, why didn’t I, why?—and I almost scream his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he’s gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get out of bed and lift the mattress with one hand, propping it up on my knee. Then I shove the gun beneath it and let the mattress bury it. Once it is out of sight and no longer pressed to my skin, my head feels clearer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that the adrenaline rush of yesterday is gone, and whatever made me sleep has worn off, the deep ache and shooting pains of my shoulder are intense. I am wearing the same clothes I wore last night. The corner of the hard drive peeks out from under my pillow, where I shoved it right before I fell asleep. On it is the simulation data that controlled the Dauntless, and the record of what the Erudite did. It feels too important for me to even touch, but I can’t leave it here, so I grab it and wedge it between the dresser and the wall. Part of me thinks it would be a good idea to destroy it, but I know it contains the only record of my parents’ deaths, so I’ll settle for keeping it hidden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone knocks on my door. I sit on the edge of the bed and try to smooth my hair down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come in,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opens, and Tobias steps halfway in, the door dividing his body in half. He wears the same jeans as yesterday, but a dark red T-shirt instead of his black one, probably borrowed from one of the Amity. It’s a strange color on him, too bright, but when he leans his head back against the doorframe, I see that it makes the blue in his eyes lighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Amity are meeting in a half hour.” He quirks his eyebrows and adds, with a touch of melodrama, “To decide our fate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. “Never thought my fate would be in the hands of a bunch of Amity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me either. Oh, I brought you something.” He unscrews the cap of a small bottle and holds out a dropper filled with clear liquid. “Pain medicine. Take a dropperful every six hours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks.” I squeeze the dropper into the back of my throat. The medicine tastes like old lemon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hooks a thumb in one of his belt loops and says, “How are you, Beatrice?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you just call me Beatrice?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thought I would give it a try.” He smiles. “Not good?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe on special occasions only. Initiation days, Choosing Days . . .” I pause. I was about to rattle off a few more holidays, but only the Abnegation celebrate them. The Dauntless have holidays of their own, I assume, but I don’t know what they are. And anyway, the idea that we would celebrate anything right now is so ludicrous I don’t continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a deal.” His smile fades. “How are you, Tris?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s not a strange question, after what we’ve been through, but I tense up when he asks it, worried that he’ll somehow see into my mind. I haven’t told him about Will yet. I want to, but I don’t know how. Just the thought of saying the words out loud makes me feel so heavy I could break through the floorboards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m . . .” I shake my head a few times. “I don’t know, Four. I’m awake. I . . .” I am still shaking my head. He slides his hand over my cheek, one finger anchored behind my ear. Then he tilts his head down and kisses me, sending a warm ache through my body. I wrap my hands around his arm, holding him there as long as I can. When he touches me, the hollowed-out feeling in my chest and stomach is not as noticeable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t have to tell him. I can just try to forget—he can help me forget.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know,” he says. “Sorry. I shouldn’t have asked.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment all I can think is, How could you possibly know? But something about his expression reminds me that he does know something about loss. He lost his mother when he was young. I don’t remember how she died, just that we attended her funeral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly I remember him clutching the curtains in his living room, about nine years old, wearing gray, his dark eyes shut. The image is fleeting, and it could be my imagination, not a memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe releases me. “I’ll let you get ready.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe women’s bathroom is two doors down. The floor is dark brown tile, and each shower stall has wooden walls and a plastic curtain separating it from the central aisle. A sign on the back wall says REMEMBER: TO CONSERVE RESOURCES, SHOWERS RUN FOR ONLY FIVE MINUTES.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stream of water is cold, so I wouldn’t want the extra minutes even if I could have them. I wash quickly with my left hand, leaving my right hand hanging at my side. The pain medicine Tobias gave me worked fast—the pain in my shoulder has already faded to a dull throb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I get out of the shower, a stack of clothes waits on my bed. It contains some yellow and red, from the Amity, and some gray, from the Abnegation, colors I rarely see side by side. If I had to guess, I would say that one of the Abnegation put the stack there for me. It’s something they would think to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull on a pair of dark red pants made of denim—so long I have to roll them up three times—and a gray Abnegation shirt that is too big for me. The sleeves come down to my fingertips, and I roll them up too. It hurts to move my right hand, so I keep the movements small and slow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone knocks on the door. “Beatrice?” The soft voice is Susan’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open the door for her. She carries a tray of food, which she sets down on the bed. I search her face for a sign of what she has lost—her father, an Abnegation leader, didn’t survive the attack—but I see only the placid determination characteristic of my old faction. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/insurgent-divergent-2/page-1.html","bookId":1699,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:19 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:19 AM"}
