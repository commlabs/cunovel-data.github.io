Despite her exhaustion, her gratitude was clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three Shangguan Sisters stood at the side, their cheeks blushing furiously. At the other end, Tian’er was smiling radiantly at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing looked at the four girls, and even he was slightly embarrassed as he said innocently: “What are you all looking at me for?

I’m going to cultivate now!” He knew that he was now one against four, and trying to argue would always be a losing position. As a result, he just sat down right away and began cultivating.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe Saint Energy in their bodies were already full, yet the Saint Core Nucleus did not form like they had expected. To Zhou Weiqing, this was a major problem. At this moment, the energy whirlpools of his Death Acupuncture Points were whirling as usual, full of Saint Energy, but he dared not continue drawing upon the atmospheric energy, otherwise he would face the same problem with being full to bursting point. That was to say… if he did not solve his current situation, he would not be able to continue cultivating.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eNaturally, Tian’er was facing the same problem as Zhou Weiqing, and she also sat down in a cross-legged meditation position to start cultivation.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Weiqing was not too impatient or agitated about the current situation, after all in a worse case situation he could just use some Saint Energy, and he would once again have ‘cleared space’ again. Of course, that was a last resort solution… it was such a rare opportunity that they had been able to gain three thousand drops of Saint Energy each, how could he possibly be willing to give it up just like that!\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe energy whirlpools of his Death Acupuncture Points continued whirling.

As a faint glow began to light up around her hands, coalescing into a solid form.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn that moment, Zhou Weiqing felt as if he had been struck by a bolt of lightning as he instantly understood, slapping his own thigh hard, he exclaimed: “Right! How could I be so stupid, such a simple solution, why didn’t I think of it!?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIndeed, Zhou Weiqing felt like slapping himself hard. Such a simple principle, yet he had overlooked it, instead overthinking things too much. In truth, the solution to their problem was the easiest and most straightforward one.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIndeed, both Tian’er and his own Saint Energy was totally full, but that was just for their meridian channels, not their entire body. More importantly, even though their Saint Energy was full, their own cultivation level and state of attainment was still far from being able to consolidate a Core Nucleus. As such, what they needed to do now was not increase their Saint Energy, but to use their Saint Energy to breakthrough to the next level! Only after reaching the Upper Level Zong Stage would they have the chance to consolidate the Saint Core Nucleus.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs soon as he thought of it, Zhou Weiqing suddenly felt fully refreshed, quickly returning back to cultivating, silently going through his Immortal Deity Technique once through, circulating his Saint Energy to begin breaking through his twenty ninth Death Acupuncture Point.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eDifferent cultivation techniques would have different methods of breaking through, and naturally some were difficult and some were easy. Of course, in terms of ‘simplicity’, there was likely no other cultivation technique that could compare with the Immortal Deity Technique, as all that was needed was to breakthrough the required Death Acupuncture Point.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAll of the previous times that Zhou Weiqing had broken through his Death Acupuncture Points, even for the twenty eighth one, he had used Heavenly Energy to do so, and he had never tried directly using Saint Energy to do so. After all, before today, his Saint Energy had been always at an extremely low amount, and he was unwilling to use it up for breaking through! However, now that his body was only left with Saint Energy, he naturally could only use Saint Energy to do so.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eUnder Zhou Weiqing’s control, the silver white Saint Energy began to circulate around his meridians according to the Immortal Deity Technique, heading directly for the twenty ninth Death Acupuncture Point.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe fourth portion of the Immortal Deity Technique was targeting the Death Acupuncture Points in the head to neck area.
