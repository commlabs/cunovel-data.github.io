Rachel wondered how her husband could be this oblivious. After helping Jolene with her algebra, she thought her relationship with the girl had improved. That peace, however, was short-lived. Within a matter of days, everything returned to the way it was from the moment Rachel had married Jolene’s father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of the family friend Rachel had been, starting when Jolene was in first grade, she became an interloper, the woman who’d trespassed on the girl’s territory. It’d been just Jolene and her father for so long that no one, no matter how close, would fit into the family picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the waitress came for their dinner order, Rachel was finally able to announce her choice. She asked for crab cakes with rice pilaf and a green salad. Both Bruce and Jolene chose the full steak dinner, complete with baked potato, soup and salad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruce, at least, was in high spirits. Rachel tried to catch his mood; she ignored every slight Jolene threw at her, smiled sweetly and pretended it didn’t hurt that her own husband hadn’t noticed the way his daughter treated her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be fair, Rachel didn’t know if she was being over-sensitive, since the pregnancy had played havoc with her emotions. The best she could do was disregard the verbal jabs and refrain from countering even the nastiest ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather and daughter spoke animatedly through dinner. Rachel swallowed a few bites and then asked for a take-out container. By contrast Bruce and Jolene both ate their entire meals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How about dessert?” Bruce said when the last of their dishes had been removed from the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel placed her hand on her stomach. “I’m full. I couldn’t eat a single bite,” she protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I could,” Jolene said eagerly. “What would you like, Dad?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruce read over the dessert menu and then looked at his daughter. “I suppose you want the ice cream sundae with chocolate sauce.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad,” she moaned playfully. “That’s for kids.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re still a kid,” Bruce said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I’m not.” Jolene giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl was happier than she’d been in all the months since Rachel had married Bruce. It was easy to see why. Jolene was in her element. She had her father’s full attention and she’d managed to shut Rachel out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Jolene didn’t know was that her father was about to deliver a devastating blow that would disrupt her entire world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey each ordered a different dessert. Bruce got the apple tart warmed and with vanilla ice cream and Jolene chose a slice of chocolate cake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruce waited until their dessert was served, then stretched his hand across the table to reach for Rachel’s. His fingers curled around hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJolene stared at Rachel and narrowed her eyes menacingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mentioned that tonight’s a celebration,” Bruce began, turning to his daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJolene slowly nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know what we’re celebrating?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, Jolene looked confused. “I passed my algebra test and advanced to intermediate in swimming, remember?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do,” Bruce commented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJolene had been forced to take the swimming test three times before advancing. In addition, she’d gotten a B-on her algebra final. Both tests had been hard for her. Rachel was proud of Jolene, although the girl had scorned her praise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This isn’t about making it into the intermediate swimming class or doing well on your algebra final,” Rachel told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJolene looked blankly at her father. “Then what are we celebrating?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruce glanced at Rachel and offered her a soft, reassuring smile. “Rachel told me some exciting news recently.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rachel did?” This was asked as if she had difficulty believing Rachel was capable of saying anything of interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jolene, tonight we’re celebrating the fact that you’re going to become a big sister.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl looked from her father to Rachel, and then back at Bruce before the light dawned. She turned to face Rachel. “You’re having a baby?” The question was an accusation more than an inquiry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGazing down at the table, Rachel nodded and then, reminding herself that she had nothing to be ashamed of, boldly met Jolene’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Daddy?” The girl turned to her father. Her face crumpled as if she was begging him to tell her it wasn’t true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Didn’t you hear me?” Bruce asked in the same animated way he’d announced her pregnancy. “We’re having a baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard,” Jolene muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aren’t you happy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReluctantly she nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can name the baby if you want,” Bruce said next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn’t discussed this with Rachel. However, if it helped Jolene adjust, she was more than willing to let the girl make suggestions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it a boy or a girl?” she asked sullenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s too early to tell,” Rachel said. “I won’t have an ultrasound for several weeks.” Personally, she’d rather not know the sex of their baby. However, it seemed important to Jolene. Rachel took longer than she should have to realize why. Jolene was afraid a baby girl would be competition for her father’s affection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought you’d show more enthusiasm than this,” Bruce complained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give her time,” Rachel said, hoping a gentle approach would soothe Jolene’s feelings. She directed her subsequent remark to Jolene. “I understand this is a shock and I apologize if it upsets you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jolene’s not upset,” Bruce said. “You aren’t, are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t respond. Instead, she glared straight ahead, avoiding eye contact with both her father and Rachel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress brought the bill and Bruce reached for his wallet. “How about a movie?” he suggested as he slid his credit card into the holder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel couldn’t imagine Jolene agreeing to spend any more time with her than necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can we just go home?” the girl asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure.” Bruce was more than eager to appease his daughter in any way he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey left the restaurant and drove back to the house. Bruce stopped to set the garbage cans by the curb while Rachel and Jolene went inside. Jolene immediately raced to her bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel slumped down in a living room chair. This had gone exactly as she’d expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s Jolene?” Bruce asked as he threw his car keys on the kitchen counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Her room.” Rachel guessed she was on her cell, talking to her friends, spilling the disastrous news to anyone and everyone who’d listen. And once Bruce was out of the house, the silent treatment would start. It was either that or a tirade against Rachel because of how she’d single-handedly ruined the girl’s life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruce stood in the middle of the room, hands on his hips. “Why’s everyone so miserable?” he asked. “I couldn’t be happier about the baby. I’m thrilled to death. Okay, I know we agreed to wait for Jolene’s sake, but the deed is done. She’ll get used to it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel feared that was simply wishful thinking on his part. “I hope so,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give the kid some credit,” Bruce said. “Jolene is flexible. It might take her a while to come to terms with the fact that we’re adding to the family, but eventually she’ll be as happy as we are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eventually,” Rachel echoed. She wasn’t a pessimist by nature, but she didn’t share his optimism about Jolene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied her for a moment. “You look tired.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am,” she said. It was a mild exaggeration, but she needed time alone to think. “Would you mind if I went to bed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlancing at his watch, he arched his brows. “It’s only seven-thirty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled slowly. “Interested in company?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled back. “Sorry, not tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face fell. “Is it going to be like this during the whole pregnancy?” He sounded like a little boy who’d been deprived of dessert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bruce,” she snapped, in no mood to deal with this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, all right, I apologize. It’s just that it’s been a while.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Three days,” she reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you keeping track?” he asked. “Isn’t that like closing the barn door after the cow gets out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a horse.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suppose you’re right. We should’ve paid more attention before now.” She stood and started toward their bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching out, Bruce grabbed her hand. His eyes were dark. “Are you saying you’d rather you weren’t pregnant?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, honestly, Bruce. You have to know the timing’s all wrong. Jolene is upset and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe released her hand. “Fine. If having my baby is such a hardship, then I won’t trouble you again. I’ll move into the spare bedroom and you can rest assured I won’t interrupt your precious sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it had come to this. The two of them were at odds, attacking each other. This should be the happiest time of her life and it was all Rachel could do not to break into tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you hear me?” Bruce demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If moving into the spare bedroom is what you want, then don’t let me stop you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty-Four\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoy McAfee wasn’t a man who got involved in other people’s affairs. In his line of work, he’d seen enough to make any man skeptical of the human heart. Because of that, he tried to stay away from divorce cases, especially those that included child custody disputes. Most of his work concerned background checks and insurance investigations. In his opinion, people had a right to live the way they wanted, unless they hurt or swindled others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reason he was making an exception now had to do with his daughter Gloria. She’d made her decision not to tell Chad Timmons she was pregnant. Corrie had given Gloria her word that she’d abide by that decision. Roy, however, saw his own situation reflected in Chad’s—a situation that hadn’t been righted for more than three decades. He refused to let that happen again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are you off to?” Corrie asked as he headed out the front door on Wednesday afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an instance such as this, it was best to be vague. “There’s something I need to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this something I know about?” Corrie eyed him speculatively, as if she’d guessed exactly who he intended to see and what he intended to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoy swore his wife had some sort of psychic ability. She seemed to instinctively know this had to do with Gloria and Chad. He hedged, reluctant to lie, and at the same time unwilling to admit he was a man on a mission—or to tell her what that mission entailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised her eyebrows. “Why don’t you want me to know what this is about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe muttered a few words he’d rather she didn’t hear and opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Roy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like I said, this is something I need to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slipped in front of him, blocking his exit. “You’re going to talk to Chad Timmons, aren’t you?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/1022-evergreen-place-cedar-cove-10/page-46.html","bookId":1952,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:01 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:01 AM"}
