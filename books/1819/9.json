Maybe she’s having a nightmare about you chasing all her boyfriends away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very funny, Ellery.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay, Connor. She’ll be fine. If she starts to scream, then we’ll get her, but until then, she’s just probably trying to get comfortable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled on my boxers and lay back in bed. “You’re right, babe,” I said as I wrapped my arms around her and stared at my daughter through the monitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 13\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllery\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne month later…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlyn’s trial had been going on for about three weeks, and Connor was under a lot of stress. Julia had started to sleep through the night, so that made things a little easier for us. Connor and I worked out at the gym every morning before he went to the office, and Mason watched Julia. He was so good with her, and it was easy to see how much he loved her. Landon confided in me that he was happy that we hired Mason as Julia’s nanny because all Mason had been talking about in California was adopting a baby, and Landon wasn’t ready for that kind of responsibility yet. So, taking care of Julia had kept Mason busy enough to get his baby fill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a typical morning. Mason was downstairs with Julia. I was putting on my workout clothes and Connor was getting his things together for work. He seemed really on edge this morning, and it was bothering me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t forget we have Camden’s birthday party this weekend at your parents’ house,” I said casually to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know if I can make it. With this trial and everything, I’m behind at the office, so I may have to work all weekend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked over to him and wrapped my arms around his waist. “Camden will be crushed if you’re not there, and you’ve never missed anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a hold of my arms and removed them from his waist. “Don’t start with me, Ellery. I’ve got a lot going on right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me, Connor!” I snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and walked out of the room. I didn’t want to start my day off with an argument, and I needed to get to the gym because I was meeting Peyton for fittings and lunch. I went downstairs and into the kitchen. I grabbed my bag and kissed Julia goodbye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mason, tell Connor that I already left.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Umm, all right, Elle. Have a good day,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the elevator down and when the doors opened, Denny was standing there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you ready to go, Ellery? Where’s Connor?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who cares, and I’m taking a cab. Bye, Denny,” I said as I stepped onto the sidewalk and hailed a cab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was on the treadmill in the gym, listening to my iPod, when Connor stepped on the treadmill next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You never cease to amaze me. I hope you know that,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, can’t hear you. Music’s playing,” I said loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ellery, take out the damn ear phones.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes and took them out. “There. Happy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head as he ran on the treadmill. “Why the hell would you not wait for me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because you were being an ass and giving me an attitude.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All I said was that I didn’t think I was going to be able to make it to Camden’s party.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You told me not to start with you in an irritated tone. So, I left because I didn’t want to bother you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Baby, you weren’t bothering me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you’re not talking to me. I know you’re not telling me things, and it’s eating you up inside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want to discuss this any further right now, especially here,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, and I got off the treadmill. “Fine. I’m going over to the spin bike.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked across to the other side of the gym where a row of spin bikes sat. I knew Connor wouldn’t come over there because he hated the spin bikes. He was irritating me with his attitude and not wanting to talk about the trial. I could understand him being upset and trying to protect me, but he needed to understand that I didn’t need protecting. I was a big girl and I could handle it. What I couldn’t handle was him neglecting his family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stayed on the bike for about forty-five minutes, and then I looked around for Connor. I went to his usual machines but he wasn’t around. I saw Toby, one of the personal trainers, and asked him if he’d seen Connor. He said he that he’d left already. My blood started to boil as anger shot through my body. I couldn’t believe that he left without saying goodbye. I stomped off to the locker room, grabbed my phone from my locker, and quickly sent him a text message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re an a**hole.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you say so,” he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes. I didn’t have time for this. I needed to shower quickly and meet Peyton down the street in less than an hour. After I finished getting dressed, I packed up my bag and left the gym. When I walked out the door, I saw Denny leaning up against the limo. I couldn’t help but smile at this all-too-familiar sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Denny, what are you doing here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just seeing if you need a ride home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, but I’m meeting Peyton down the street.” I smiled as I started to walk away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ellery!” Denny called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped, turned around, and looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know that you and Julia are the things that matters most to Connor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know that, Denny,” I said as I looked down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He may not always be right, but he loves you more than his own life, and he would do anything to protect you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears began to fill my eyes as I looked up to keep them from falling. I walked over to where Denny was standing, and I gave him a hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I love him more than life too,” I whispered in his ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenny kissed me on the cheek and smiled. “Go on and get out of here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling back, I turned away and walked down the street to the café where I was meeting Peyton. Upon arrival, I stepped inside and saw her sitting down at a table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There you are. What took you so long?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ugh. I’ve had a bad morning, thanks to my husband,” I said as I dug for my phone in my purse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did he do? He’s too perfect to cause you to have a bad day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hold on, I need to text him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just wanted you to know that I don’t think you’re an a**hole and I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin seconds, a reply from him came through. “I love you too and we’ll talk when I get home. See if Mason can watch Julia tonight and we’ll go out; just the two of us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Elle, what’s wrong? You look like you’re stressed,” Peyton said as she pushed a cup of coffee towards me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Connor’s been under a lot of pressure with this trial, and he’s been uptight and irritable lately. I need to do something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you want to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had the idea in my head that if I went to the jail and paid a visit to Ashlyn that maybe we could talk, woman to woman, and I could convince her to change her plea. I know, wishful thinking, but it was worth a try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you busy tomorrow?” I asked as I looked at Peyton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, why? What are you planning to do?” she asked with knitted eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to go to the jail and pay Ashlyn a little visit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeyton’s eyes widened. “Are you f**king crazy?!” she voiced rather loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Peyton! Keep your voice down!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, but you’re crazy. Connor will kill you, Elle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll handle Connor, and he won’t know anyway. I just want to pay a friendly visit, woman to woman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeyton kept shaking her head. I knew she didn’t agree with me, but she was the only person I could trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever, Ellery. I’ll go with you, but I don’t agree.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.” I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe got up from our seats and headed to the bridal shop for our fitting. As I saw Peyton step out of the dressing room in her wedding dress, my eyes began to fill with tears. She looked stunning, and it reminded me of the day Connor and I were married. I hated the way we left things, and I needed to stop by Black Enterprises to see him. As the tailor was pinning my dress, I called Mason to check on Julia. I missed her terribly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello, doll face. If you’re calling about the princess, she’s wonderful. We’re getting ready to go to the park.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, Mason. I’m calling to see if you could babysit her tonight while Connor and I go out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I can. I’ll watch her at my place and then Landon can have some Julia time too!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks. I’ll be home in a while,” I said as I hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told Peyton we needed to stop at Connor’s office for a minute because I needed to pick something up. She gave me a look of disbelief. I never could pull anything over on her. We stepped off the elevator and headed down the hallway towards Connor’s office. Valerie was sitting at her desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, Ellery.” She smiled as she looked up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, Valerie. Is he in there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, he is. Do you want me to tell him you’re here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I’ll surprise him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s in a mood today,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know he is,” I said as I put my hand on the handle. “Peyton, I’ll only be a few minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slowly turned the handle and opened the door. Connor was looking down at some papers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Valerie, I thought I gave strict instructions that I didn’t want to be bothered,” he said in an irritated tone without looking up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even for your wife?” I smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor looked up and a smile lit up his face. He got up from his desk and walked towards me. I subtly locked the office door and met him halfway across the room. As I approached him, he wrapped his arms tightly around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing here, baby?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just needed to hug you and tell you that I’m sorry for everything that happened today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Baby, there’s no need to apologize. I’m the one who’s sorry,” he said as he rubbed his cheek through my hair. “Where’s Peyton? I thought you had plans with her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s waiting outside the office. I told her I’d be quick.” I smiled as I started to unbuckle his belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor’s smile grew as he looked at me. “Make up sex, eh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You bet, and I can’t wait until tonight,” I said as I unbuttoned his pants, took them down, and pushed him on the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat there staring at me as I did a little strip dance. “Oh, God, Elle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I smiled and climbed on top of him, he grabbed my h*ps and gently eased me down onto him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re already so wet,” he whispered as he took my nipple in his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what you do to me, babe. You don’t even have to touch me. Your looks are more than enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I began to slowly thrust my h*ps back and forth, Connor threw his head back and a soft moan came from the back of his throat. He was so hard as I moved my h*ps around in a circular motion, slowly and fluently. He took his hand and reached down for my clit. I grabbed it as I looked at him and winked. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-us-forever-3/page-9.html","bookId":1819,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:38 PM"}
