The human brain. Composed of thirty billion neurons. Each neuron communicates to its neighbors via multiple synapses. Creating roughly one million billion synaptic connections. These connections, in turn, create a very large number of neural circuits. And by large, I mean in the order of ten followed by a million zeros.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A million zeros?” Painter said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalcolm looked over the edge of his glasses at Painter. “To give you some scale. The total number of atoms in the entire universe is only ten followed by eighty zeros.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Painter’s shocked reaction, Malcolm nodded. “So there’s a vast amount of computing power locked in our skulls that we’re only beginning to comprehend. We’ve just been scratching the surface.” He pointed toward the window. “Someone out there has been delving much deeper.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?” Kat asked, her expression showing worry for the girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With our current technology, we’ve been making tentative strides into this new frontier. Like sending probes into space, we’ve been slipping electrodes into brains. All input into the brain is via electrical impulses. We don’t see with our eyes. We see with our brains. It’s why cochlear implants work to return hearing to the deaf. The implant turns sounds into electrical impulses, which are passed to the brain via a microelectrode inserted into the auditory nerve. Over time, the cortex learns to reinterpret this new signal, and like learning a new language, the deaf begin to hear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalcolm waved to his laptop. “The human brain—being electrical, being malleable to new signals—has an innate ability to connect to machines. In some regards, that makes us perfect natural-born cyborgs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter frowned. “Where are you going with all this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa placed a hand atop his. “We’re already there. The division between man and machine is already blurred. We now have microelectrodes so small that they can be inserted into individual neurons. At Brown University in 2006, they inserted a microchip into a paralyzed man’s brain, linked by a hundred of these microelectrodes. Within four days of practicing, the man—through his thoughts alone—could move a computer cursor on a screen, open e-mail, control a television, and move a robotic arm. That’s how far we’ve breeched the frontier.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter glanced to the window. “And someone’s gone farther than that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Lisa and Malcolm nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The device?” Painter asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A step above anything we’ve seen. It has nanofilament electrodes so tiny that it’s hard to say where the device ends and the child’s brain begins. But the basic function is well known. From studies done at Harvard University on rats, we know that TMS devices promote the growth of neurons—though, oddly, only in areas involved with learning and memory. We still don’t understand why. But what we do know is that magnetic stimulation can also turn on and off these neurons like a switch. Children are especially pliable in this manner.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So if I understand this all correctly, someone has wired such a device to the child, stimulated nerve growth in a specific area, and now controls its functioning like a switch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Generally speaking, yes,” Malcolm said. “They’ve tapped deep into that vast neural network I described. Only with the magnetic-stimulation of new neurons, they’ve expanded that network even farther. And if I’m right, I’d say they’ve focused that expansion in a very narrow area.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What makes you say that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s a law in neurology. Hebb’s law. That basically states nerves that fire together, wire together. By stimulating one site in the brain, they are reinforcing it harder and harder.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But to what end?” Painter asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalcolm shared a worried glance with Lisa. He wanted her to explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. “I spoke to the psychologist, Zach Larson, who examined the girl when she was first brought in. From her nonresponsiveness, repetitive behavior, and sensitivity to stimulation, Zach is certain the girl is autistic. And from the behavior you described at the safe house, probably an autistic savant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter had read Larson’s report, too. It had been put together quickly, but it had been thorough. He had run a small battery of psychological tests, including a genetic study for some of the typical markers for autism. The last was still pending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d also included fact sheets on the subject of autistic savants, those rare individuals who—though compromised by their disorder—have amazing islands of talent. A skill that is deep and narrow. Painter remembered the character played by Dustin Hoffman in the movie Rain Man. His ability was to do lightning calculations. But this was only one of the savant talents on Larson’s list. Others included calendar calculations, memorization skills, musical talent, mechanical and spatial skills, exquisite discrimination of smell, taste, or hearing, and also art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter pictured the drawing of the Taj Mahal. It had been sketched in minutes, handsomely drawn to scale, with perfectly balanced perspective. The girl was certainly talented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut was it more than that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last on Larson’s list of savant talents was a rare and controversial report of some autistic savants who displayed extrasensory skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter could not dismiss that the girl’s drawings had led the Gypsies unerringly to their safe house. He recalled the earlier discussion with Elizabeth, about her father’s work on intuition and instinct, about his connection with a deep-black government project involved in remote viewing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa continued, “We think the device is meant to stimulate that area of the brain where the savant talent lies. It’s known that most savant talent arises from the right side of the brain, the same side where the device is attached on both the skull and the girl. Even using today’s technology, it would not take much effort to localize the region regulating this talent. And once found, the magnetic stimulation could both amplify that area and control it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter stood with dawning horror. If Lisa and Malcolm were correct, someone was harnessing this child’s abilities. He crossed toward the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho did this to the girl?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat had joined Painter and pointed through the window. “She’s awake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she was drawing again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl had found a notepad and black felt pen on the bedside table. She scratched across it, not quite as frantically as before, but she was still bent with concentration over the page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat headed to the door. Painter followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl did not acknowledge them, but as they stepped through, both pad and pen dropped to her bedsheet. She went back to rocking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat stared down at the artwork, then fell back a step with a small gasp. Painter understood her reaction. There was no mistaking what was drawn in ink and paper, a portrait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was her husband, Monk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11:04 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSouthern Ural Mountains\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRussian Federation\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk helped Pyotr along a fallen log that forded a deep stream, churning over jumbled rocks. Moss grew heavy on the log, along with a few fat white mushrooms. The entire place smelled damp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiska was already on the other side, standing with Marta, holding the old chimpanzee’s paw. Monk wanted to be across the next rise and into the neighboring valley. Hopping off the log, he stared behind him. They were crossing a dense birch forest, whose white-barked trunks looked like dried bone. The green foliage was already flamed in patches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk picked one of the red leaves, rubbing it between his fingers. Still soft, not dried out. Early fall. But the changing leaves promised a cold night among the low mountains here. But at least there should be no snow. He dropped the crushed leaf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow did he know all this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. Such answers would have to wait. Still, he found it disturbing how quickly he was growing accustomed to the disconnect between his lack of memory and his knowledge of the world. Then again, they were being hunted. They had to move quietly, sound carried far in the mountains. Through whispers and hand signals, they communicated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk searched the far side of the stream. They had been on the run for the past three hours. He had set a hard pace, trying to put as much distance between them and where they’d exited the subterranean world. He didn’t know how long it would take for the hunters to realize the escapees had abandoned the cavern and to pick up their trail out here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk waited at the stream’s edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was Konstantin?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if beckoned by his thought, the taller boy came dancing down the far slope, as lithe and firm footed as a young buck. His face, though, was a mask of fear as he ambled, arms out, across the slippery log.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did it!” he said. Wheezing heavily, he jumped and landed next to Monk. “I took your hospital nightshirt and dragged it to the stream in the other valley.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you threw it in the water?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Past that beaver dam. Like you said.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonk nodded. His hospital nightshirt had been soiled with blood and sweat. One of the kids had stolen it from his room after he’d changed. It was smart thinking. If they’d left the shirt, his captors would have known he’d changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt also came in handy in laying a false trail. He had further soiled the shirt by wiping sweat from his brow and underarms. He had done the same with the kids and the chimpanzee, too. The riper garment should leave a stronger trail, a false trail. Hopefully the scent would send the hunters searching in the wrong direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Help me with this,” Monk said to Konstantin and leaned down to the log they’d used to cross.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether, the two got the log rocking, but they still couldn’t dislodge it. Monk then felt a huff at his cheek. He turned to see Marta shouldering into the log. With a single heave, the chimpanzee rolled the fallen log into the stream. She was strong. The log fell with a heavy splash, then bobbed and teetered down the waterway. Monk watched it float away. The more ways they could break their trail, all the better. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-last-oracle-sigma-force-5/page-22.html","bookId":1528,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:06 PM"}
