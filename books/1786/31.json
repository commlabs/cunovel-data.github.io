If I see any of them, especially the rom baro, I\u0027ll kill him with my bare hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" Rohan returned equably. \"After they tell us about the tattoo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All they\u0027ll say is what I\u0027ve already told you-it\u0027s the mark of a curse. And if you ever find out what it means-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, yes, I know. We\u0027re doomed. But if I\u0027m wearing a curse on my arm, Merripen, I want to know about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKev gave him a glance that should have felled him on the spot. He stopped at a corner of the stables, where hoof picks, clippers, and files were neatly organized on shelves. \"I\u0027m not going. You\u0027ll have to look for my tribe without me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need you,\" Rohan countered. \"For one thing, the place we\u0027re headed to is kekkeno mushespuv.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKev stared at him in disbelief. Kekkeno mushes puv, translated as \"no-man\u0027s-land,\" was a squalid plain located on the Surrey side of the Thames. The open muddy ground was crowded with ragged Gypsy tents, a few dilapidated vardos, feral dogs, and nearly feral Roma. But that wasn\u0027t the real danger. There was another, non-Gypsy group called the Chorodies, descendants of rogues and outcasts, mainly Saxon in origin. The Chorodies were truly vile, dirty, and ferocious, without customs or manners. Going anywhere near them was virtually asking to be attacked or robbed. It was hard to imagine a more dangerous place in London except for a few Eastside rookeries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you think anyone from my tribe could be in such a place?\" Kev asked, more than a little shocked by the idea. Surely, even under the rom baro\u0027s leadership, they wouldn\u0027t have sunk so low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not long ago I met a chal from the Bosvil tribe. He said his youngest sister, Shuri, was married long ago to your mm baro.\u0027\" Rohan stared at Merripen intently. \" It seems the story of what happened to you has been told all through Romanija.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see why,\" Kev muttered, feeling suffocated. \"It\u0027s not important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRohan shrugged casually, his gaze trained on Kev\u0027s face. \"The Rom take care of their own. No tribe would ever leave an injured or dying boy behind, no matter what the circumstances. And apparently it brought a curse on the rom baro\u0027s tribe… Their luck turned very bad, and most of them came to ruin. There\u0027s justice for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never cared about justice.\" Kev was vaguely surprised by the rustiness of his own voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRohan spoke with quiet understanding. \"It\u0027s a strange life, isn\u0027t it?… A Rom with no tribe. No matter how hard you look, you can never find a home. Because to us, home is not a building or a tent or vardo… home is a family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKev had a difficult time meeting Rohan\u0027s gaze. The words cut too close to his heart. In all the time he had known Rohan, Kev had never felt a kinship with him until now. But Kev could no longer ignore the fact that they had too damn much in common. They were two outsiders with pasts full of unanswered questions. And each of them had been drawn to the Hathaways, and had found a home with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go with you, damn it,\" Kev said gruffly. \"But only because I know what Amelia would do to me if I let something happen to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Ten\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere in England, spring had covered the ground with green velvet and coaxed flowers from the hedgerows. Somewhere the sky was blue and the air was sweet. But not in no-man\u0027s-land, where smoke from millions of chimney pipes had soured the complexion of the city with a yellow fog that daylight could barely penetrate. There was little but mud and misery in this barren place. It was located approximately a quarter mile from the river and bordered by a hill and a railway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKev was grim and silent as he and Rohan led their horses through the Romany camp. Tents were loosely scattered, with men sitting at the entrances and whittling pegs or making baskets. Kev heard a few boys shouting at one another. As he rounded a tent, he saw a small group gathered around a fight. Men angrily shouted instructions and threats to the boys as if they were animals in a pit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStopping at the sight, Kev stared at the boys while images from his own childhood flashed through his mind. Pain, violence, fear… the wrath of the rom baro, who would beat Kev further if he lost. And if he won, sending another boy bloodied and broken to the ground, there would be no reward. Only the crushing guilt of harming someone who had done no wrong to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is this? the rom baro had roared, discovering Kev huddled in a corner, crying, after he had beaten a boy who had begged him to stop. You pathetic, sniveling dog. I\u0027ll give you one of these- His booted foot had landed in Kev\u0027s side, bruising a rib-for every tear you shed. What kind of idiot would cry for winning? Crying after doing the only thing you\u0027re good for? I\u0027ll drive the softness out of you, big bawling infant- He hadn\u0027t stopped kicking Kev until he was unconscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next time Kev had beaten someone, he had felt no guilt. He had felt nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKev wasn\u0027t aware that he\u0027d frozen in his tracks, or that he was breathing heavily, until Rohan spoke to him softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come, phral.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTearing his gaze away from the boys, Kev saw the compassion and sanity in the other man\u0027s eyes. The dark memories receded. Kev gave a short nod and followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRohan stopped at two or three tents, asking the whereabouts of a woman named Shuri. The responses were grudging. As expected, the Roma regarded Rohan and Kev with obvious suspicion and curiosity. The Roma\u0027s dialect was difficult to interpret, a medley of deep Romany and what was called \"tinker patois,\" a slang used by urban Gypsies. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-me-at-sunrise-the-hathaways-2/page-31.html","bookId":1786,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:37:59 PM"}
