Ellie had no idea how bad the wound was, but she thought, if she could stabilize him, he’d make it to the OR.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ambulance crossed the grassy area of the park in no time and stopped a few feet away from the downed man. Two paramedics leapt to the ground. Ellie recognized them: Mary Lynn Scott and Russell Probst. Russell opened the back doors and pulled out the gurney while Mary Lynn reached for the large, orange trauma bag and rushed forward, sliding to her knees beside the victim. By the time Ellie reached the scene, armed agents had surrounded him. One knelt on the ground talking to the man, trying to keep him calm, while two others stood over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn agent, taller than the other two and much more muscular through the shoulders, blocked her view. He barely glanced at her as he brusquely ordered, “You don’t need to see this. Go back to your soccer game.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGo back to your game? Was he serious? Ellie was about to protest when one of the paramedics looked up, spotted her, and shouted, “Oh, thank God. Dr. Sullivan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll three agents looked at her skeptically and then slowly stepped aside so that she could get past. Mary Lynn tossed her a pair of gloves, and Ellie pulled them on as she knelt down beside the man to assess the injury. Blood saturated the man’s shirt. She gently lifted the compress Mary Lynn had pressed to his shoulder, saw the damage, and immediately sought to stem the bleeding. While she gave orders to Russell and Mary Lynn, she kept her voice steady. The patient was conscious, and she didn’t want him to panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How bad is it?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made it a point never to lie to a patient. That didn’t mean she had to be brutally honest, however. “It’s bad, but I’ve seen much worse, much worse.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRussell handed her a clamp, and she found the source of the bleeding. The bullet hadn’t gone through but had made quite an entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce Mary Lynn had gotten the IV line in, Ellie nodded to her to begin the drip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s your name?” she asked as she began packing the wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sean . . . Sean . . . ah, hell, I can’t remember my last name.” His eyelids began to flutter as he struggled to stay conscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe agent kneeling behind him said, “Goodman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, that’s right,” Sean said, his voice growing weaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can you remember if you’re allergic to anything?” Mary Lynn asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just bullets.” Sean stared at Ellie through half-closed eyes. “Are you a doctor?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” she said, flashing a smile. She finished packing the wound and leaned back on her heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dr. Sullivan’s a trauma surgeon,” Russell explained. “If you had to get shot, she’s the one you want operating on you. She’s the best there is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, he’s stable. You can take him,” Ellie said as she peeled off her gloves and dropped them in the plastic container Mary Lynn opened for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean suddenly grabbed her arm, his grip surprisingly strong. “Wait . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to marry Sara. Am I going to see her again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned over him. “Yes, you will,” she said. “But first you’re going into the OR to get that bullet out. Now sleep. It’s all good. The surgeon will take care of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s on tonight?” Russell asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Edmonds and Walmer,” Mary Lynn answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean tightened his hold on Ellie’s arm. “I want you.” He didn’t give her time to respond but held tight and forced himself to stay awake as he repeated, “He said you’re the best. I want you to operate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her hand on top of his and nodded. “Okay,” she said. “Okay, I’ll do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood and stepped back to get out of the way so that the paramedics could put Sean into the ambulance but was stopped by something solid. It felt as though she’d just backed into a slab of granite. The agent who had told her to go back to her soccer game was blocking her exit with his warm, hard chest. He put his hands on her shoulders to steady her, then let go. When he still didn’t get out of her way, she stood her ground pressed against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dr. Sullivan, do you want to ride with us?” Russell called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, go ahead. He’s stable now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRussell swung the doors shut, jumped into the driver’s seat, and the ambulance was on its way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllie turned to the agent who had been kneeling with Sean. “Was anyone else hurt?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe granite wall behind her answered. “Not hurt, dead.” He was very matter-of-fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They weren’t ours,” another agent explained. “They were wanted men.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned around and came face to shoulders with the most intimidating man she’d ever seen, and that was saying something considering the monster chief of surgery she worked under. This man didn’t look anything like him, though. The agent was tall, dark, and scary, with thick black hair and penetrating, steely gray eyes. His firm square jaw was covered with at least one day’s growth of beard, maybe two. He looked as though he hadn’t slept in at least twenty-four hours, a look she knew all too well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllie’s heart skipped a beat. The man could scare the quills off a porcupine. But, oh God, was he sexy! Ellie gave herself a mental slap. An intimidating man who was built like a monument and could melt iron with his menacing glare—this was what she was attracted to?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe agent who had been kneeling stepped forward and put out his hand. “I’m Agent Tom Bradley. Sean Goodman’s my partner.” He introduced her to the agent on his left and then to the man in front of her. “Agent Max Daniels.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. “If you’ll excuse me, I need to get to the OR.” She didn’t wait for permission, but turned and ran back to the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty minutes later she was dropping the bullet she’d retrieved from Sean’s shoulder into a small metal pan. “Bag it and get it to one of the agents waiting outside. You know the drill.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the real work of repairing the damage began. Ellie had learned over the years that there was no such thing as a simple bullet wound. Bullets had a way of doing considerable damage before settling, but Agent Goodman was lucky. His bullet hadn’t penetrated any major organs or nerves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce she’d closed, she followed the patient to recovery, wrote orders, and went to talk to the crowd gathered in the surgical waiting room. A dozen people with worried faces sat waiting for the news. Agent Daniels was standing, leaning against the wall with his arms across his chest. His gaze followed her as she entered the room, and her heart began to race. She knew she looked a mess. She pulled off her cap and threaded her fingers through her hair. Why in heaven’s name she wanted to look good for him was beyond her comprehension, and yet she did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The surgeon’s here,” Daniels announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA petite young woman jumped up and rushed forward, followed by Agent Bradley and a crowd of worried relatives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The surgery went well,” she began and then explained some of what she had repaired, trying not to be too technical. “I expect him to make a full recovery.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara, his fiancée, was crying as she stammered her thank-you. She shook Ellie’s hand and held on to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can see him in about an hour,” Ellie told her. “He’s heavily sedated and he’s not going to know you’re there,” she warned. “He’ll be in recovery for a while, then they’ll take him to ICU. Once the nurses in ICU have him settled, they’ll send someone to get you. Any questions?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA frazzled-looking nurse appeared in the doorway. “Dr. Sullivan?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you mind looking at Mrs. Klein for us? She’s Edmond’s patient, but he’s in surgery.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be right there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe patted Sara’s hand and pulled free. “All right then. It’s all good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the corner of her eye, she saw Agent Daniels smile as she turned to leave. She walked down the corridor and had just turned the corner when he caught up with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Doctor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned around. Her stupid heart went into overdrive again. “Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re going to need to talk to you about the shooting. You’ll have to give a statement.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How about after you check on that patient?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t resist. “Gee, I don’t know. I hate to miss soccer practice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was laughing as she pushed the doors aside and disappeared into ICU.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax Daniels stood there staring after her, a slight grin crossing his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn,” he whispered. “Damn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTable of Contents\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeaser chapter\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTitle Page\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCopyright Page\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDedication\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrologue\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 5\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 7\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 10\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 12\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 13\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 14\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 15\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 16\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 18\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 20\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 21\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEPILOGUE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDUTTON\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePublished by Penguin Group (USA) Inc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e375 Hudson Street, New York, New York 10014, U.S.A.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenguin Group (Canada), 90 Eglinton Avenue East, Suite 700, Toronto, Ontario M4P 2Y3,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCanada (a division of Pearson Penguin Canada Inc.); Penguin Books Ltd, 80 Strand, London\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWC2R 0RL, England; Penguin Ireland, 25 St. Stephen’s Green, Dublin 2, Ireland (a division\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof Penguin Books Ltd); Penguin Group (Australia), 250 Camberwell Road, Camberwell,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVictoria 3124, Australia (a division of Pearson Australia Group Pty Ltd); Penguin Books\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndia Pvt Ltd, 11 Community Centre, Panchsheel Park, New Delhi—110 017, India; Penguin\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGroup (NZ), 67 Apollo Drive, Rosedale, Auckland 0632, New Zealand (a division of Pearson\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew Zealand Ltd); Penguin Books (South Africa) (Pty) Ltd, 24 Sturdee Avenue, Rosebank,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohannesburg 2196, South Africa\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenguin Books Ltd, Registered Offices: 80 Strand, London WC2R 0RL, England\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePublished by Dutton, a member of Penguin Group (USA) Inc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCopyright © 1993 by Julie Garwood All rights reserved\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeISBN : 978-1-101-53307-9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePUBLISHER’S NOTE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis book is a work of fiction.

Thomas, the elder of the two young men, leaned forward on his perch atop the stone wall outside the sanctuary.
