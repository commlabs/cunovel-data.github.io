The spear-shaped battle spirit slowly shed its original bronze color and changed into a brilliant silver.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTime passed on. The purple Dao patterns constantly circled around that spear-shaped battle spirit, greedily absorbing all of the surrounding energy in that golden sea. This was the heaven and earth origin energy released from a top grade spirit essence stone, a heaven-step Demon God Bone, sea serpent crystals, and other such heavenly treasures; the quality was exceedingly high.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, as this vast and terrifying energy flowed into the tiny purple Dao patterns, it actually only caused them to slightly brighten, without any change at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter the energy was constantly consumed by Lin Ming, the sea of energy within the Sky Lock Array also began to subside. The golden light in the skies faded, no longer being blinding to the eye. Even the golden divine thunder that flashed in the heavens began to dim down, hiding away deep within the clouds.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA moment later, the energy finally stopped moving. The mighty and overwhelming supernatural power that had shocked everyone present had finally disappeared.

To use three God Transforming Pills to force his way through a breakthrough, that is simply far too risky! We can only lament that this eternally rare talent was forced into a dead end by the Asura Divine Kingdom and had to make a final gamble. However, he still fell short in the end!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA fifth-grade sect’s Life Destruction martial artist shook his head with regret. If Lin Lanjian had been allowed to grow, then he would have inevitably blossomed into brilliance, becoming the greatest genius in the history of the Sky Spill Continent!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, reality was reality, there were no ifs or buts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNone of the martial artists left yet.

You must wait until your cultivation is solid enough before you attempt this. Otherwise, even if you are an eternally rare talent, you still have a chance of dying.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Yes, this disciple will remember your teachings!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm.” The old man nodded with satisfaction, no longer saying anything.

The sound of the Great Dao returned in bursts, like the whispers of a divine god, cold, calm, and without any emotion.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs this thrumming sound entered the ear, it made them feel a sense of awe emerge from their hearts, even making them want to fall to the ground and lie prostrate in worship.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe sound became increasingly clear. The Xiantian realm martial artists and below weren’t able to withstand this pressure and fell to their knees, feeling a faint shiver in their souls.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEveryone couldn’t help but look up. They saw that changes were occurring in the violent thunder that was rampaging across the skies. The originally quiet divine thunder seemed to have come to life once again, condensing in the air, intensifying and becoming increasingly fierce and wild like a raging tide!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe thunderclaps became increasingly loud until they were able to penetrate the clouds and crack apart stone, nearly breaking apart the eardrums of those who listened to it!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What is happening!?!?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAll of the martial artists’ complexions changed, especially those with lower cultivations. Facing the glory of the world appearing in such a fashion, they inevitably felt the deepest part of their souls tremble.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eArcs of lightning rolled in the sky, forming a net of purple thunder.

In the 100,000 years of the Sky Spill Continent’s recorded history, this sort of situation had never happened before.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt wasn’t just Shibai who was shocked – even the Asura Divine Emperor was surprised, with an uncertain expression on his face. Could this be…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the Asura Divine Emperor looked into the skies, purple lines began to appear in the air. These lines seemed as if they were faint tracings of a dragon, recklessly twisting and waving around! These purple lines corresponded with the lines appearing on Lin Ming’s spear-shaped battle spirit.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThese were the mysteries of heaven, a phenomenon closest to the source Laws of the universe. The space barrier of the dimensional realm simply wasn’t able to stop it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThese purple patterns began to fall downwards like a heavy mountain. The Elders Palace was unable to withstand such a great pressure and began to collapse like a sand castle!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Retreat!

This was the question he was most concerned about.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You idiot, of course he hasn’t died, otherwise how could this sort of scene occur!” The young martial artist’s master snappily replied. However, as he spoke these words, even he couldn’t confirm them. Could Lin Lanjian really have made such a tremendous scene occur?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShibai also retreated a distance, a dignified look on his face.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHe used his soul force to observe Lin Ming’s situation within the Sky Lock Array. Before this, of the energy that Lin Ming had been using to reform himself, he had absorbed all of it, whether it was the energy from the heavenly treasures or the golden red lightning. But now, this golden purple lightning didn’t seem as if it had come from Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe net of thunder in the skies became increasingly dense, finally interweaving into a blanket without a single gap. It covered the entire dimensional realm, making it appear even brighter than daytime. Most people had difficulty simply opening their eyes.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAnd at this time, from the far north of the dimensional realm, a blazing beam of light shot over.

It stepped on a path of purple light that spread out beneath it, dashing over from the far horizon.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIts baleful glare locked onto Lin Ming’s position, its eyes filled with a frenzied rage.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis vicious beast of thunder was the Purple Lion Thunder Source that had come from the Nine Heavens Thunder Dominion above the 8000 Mile Black Swamp. It had felt its life’s Twinlife Thunder Crystal suddenly shatter, and it felt a deep pain in its heart. It had rushed out from the Sea of Miracles, wanting to rip Lin Ming to pieces to give vent to this fiery anger.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What is that!?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It’s a lion!

Even a low-grade heaven-step Thunder Soul was rarely seen once in a lifetime, so how could these martial artists possibly determine the level of this Thunder Source?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This Thunder Soul came from the north so it has nothing to do with Lin Lanjian.

Even though the present thunder-attribute martial artists had already reached high stages of Life Destruction, and two of them were ranked highly on the Destiny Decree, none of them dared to rashly do anything.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNow was not the time to consider how to split this Thunder Soul – they first had to capture it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Let’s attack together!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA purple-clothed old man took the lead.

Of them, the weakest was at the fourth stage of Life Destruction. Anyone at a lower boundary didn’t help, because anything they tried would be useless anyway.

His body shook as the roar washed over him, causing him to bleed out from his head. The Purple Lion Thunder Source then formed a massive purple claw and swiped out at the purple-clothed old man.
