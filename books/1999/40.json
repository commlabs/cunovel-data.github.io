Sorry I brought her to LA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I had never talked Tru into moving to LA, this never would have happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe should have moved to the UK. If we had, she wouldn’t be in that hospital bed fighting for her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFighting. For. Her. Life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to fight. I want to fight this fucking pain out of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to beat the shit out of the motherfucker who got drunk, and then climbed into his car and ran that red light, changing our lives irrevocably. I hate that he’s dead, because I want to kill him myself. I want to kill that bastard over and over again for what he’s done to my girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like I haven’t breathed since I saw her. All those tubes were coming out of her body, with the sound of the ventilator’s pumping giving me the only sign she’s still alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI miss her so fucking much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI miss her voice. Her smile. Her beautiful brown eyes gazing at me in that special way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she dies…if I lose her…I don’t think I’ll be able to go on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do you live when your life dies?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light in the elevator bank signals an imminent stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth dries and my hands start to shake. I flex my fingers in and out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door slides open. I see Eva first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn’t realized until this moment just how much Tru looks like her mom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing Eva, her eyes wide with fear and heartbreak, looking like Tru, twists a knife in my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes meet mine and I see them fill with tears. “Oh, Jake.” Her voice breaks. She rushes toward me, throwing her arms around me, and cries into my T-shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to hold it together, but then Billy is there. He puts one arm around Eva, the other around me, and I break down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment, I wipe my face dry on my sleeve. Needing to regain some space and composure, I take a step back from them both. “Shall I take you to Tru?” I ask, my voice hoarse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDabbing her eyes dry with a tissue, Eva replies, “Yes,” at the same time as Billy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we walk to Tru’s room, I’m relieved for the space to piece myself back together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eListening to Billy and Eva cry for Tru was like feeling their heartbreak coupled in with my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know heartbreak. I felt it when Tru left me when I fucked up with the drugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this—it’s like my heart is slowly dying, gasping for the fuel it needs to go on. Tru. I know, unequivocally, if I lose her, everything that is me will go with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we approach Tru’s room, Dave stands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s the only one here at the moment. I sent everyone to the hotel across the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI needed them all out of here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told them Billy and Eva would need space with Tru. But honestly, I just couldn’t cope with Simone’s constant crying. Stuart’s worrying eyes on me. Even Tom was driving me insane. He kept looking at me like he was expecting me to fall over the edge. I know what he was thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat they’re all thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorrying I’ll do what I always do when things get hard—run straight to the ready hands of a dealer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not doing that this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings are bad enough without me being the coward I know I am and erasing the pain with coke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew it was only going to get so much harder when Billy and Eva arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just didn’t realize how much harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. and Mrs. Bennett, I’m so very sorry about Tru.” I notice that Dave can’t meet their eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch Eva’s eyes rake over Dave’s injuries, then come back to his face. “Dave, you were with Tru…in the accident?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods solemnly, his eyes going to the floor. “Yes. I was driving the car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was she…awake after the accident?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear clings to my skin. I hadn’t asked this question, because I was afraid of the answer. I can’t bear to think of Tru in pain. The thought alone tears me to pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDave looks up, first at me, then Eva. “No.” He shakes his head. “She didn’t wake up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear a rush of breath come from Billy, mirroring my own. As I glance at him, I see how very bad he looks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnshaven, crumpled, quiet. Not the Billy I know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s his little girl. This is killing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe need to get this over with. They need to see Tru.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take the lead, heading for the door, and they both follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the instant they see her, their reaction is no different than mine was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hurts so fucking much to hear their pain. Watch them sob over her bedside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s crippling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like I’m drowning again. Fighting against the tide with no way of surfacing. Suffocating under the pressure of the emotions in the room. I know I have to get out of here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlipping out of the room quietly, I leave them alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFogged up, my head aching, I take the seat beside Dave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sit in mutual silence for a long moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t blame you,” I finally say. I take a deep breath, then turn and look at him. “I know you will have done everything you could to protect her. I know what kind of man you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDave turns, briefly meeting my eyes. He gives a slow nod, then quickly looks away. I don’t miss the tears misting up his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to Tru’s room opens soon after, and Billy and Eva emerge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can we see him?” Billy asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course.” I get up and lead the way to my son’s—their grandson’s—room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push the door open. The nurse is sitting in a chair by his incubator, reading.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing her book, she stands at our entrance. “I’ll give y’all a moment,” she says, exiting the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room is so silent. The only sound is the blipping of the machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk over and stare down at my sleeping boy. I get a heavy combination of love and heartbreak every time I look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning back, I see Billy and Eva still standing near the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s sleeping,” I say quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly is first to move. He walks over to the incubator and stands beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear his breath catch. Lifting his gaze back to Eva, he says to her, “He looks just like Tru.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bite my quivering lip, hard, to stop the flow of emotion I feel coming, and I get a sharp taste of blood in my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEva comes over, so I stand back to give them space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know why they were hesitant to see him once they were in here. They fear he might be all they’ll have left of Tru.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know this because it’s what I’m so very fucking terrified of myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResting her hand lightly on the top of the incubator, Eva turns to me. “Do you have a name for him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” I shake my head. “We couldn’t agree on one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTru and I had so many disagreements over baby names. But now it all just seems so irrelevant. I would give anything for her to be here with me, naming our son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want to name him until Tru wakes up.” I clear my throat. “I want her to choose his name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEva nods. “I think she’ll like that, Jake.” She looks back down at my boy. “For now, my little darling,” she says, smiling, “until your mummy wakes up, you’re Baby Wethers-Bennett.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, so in the world of music”—I start flicking through the music magazine that Dave brought me—“there is absolutely nothing worth telling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing the magazine, I toss it to the floor beside my chair, and it hits with a loud slap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning back, I stretch out my aching legs and push my fingers into my hair. “What else is happening? Right, so Vicky’s going home today. She’s stayed as long as she could, sweetheart, but she has to get back to the magazine, keep it running so you’ve got a job to go back to. Not that you need to work, but I know how much you love your job. Oh, and don’t worry about the book launch. The publishers said it can happen whenever we want, so there’s no worry on that score…” Taking a deep breath, I trail off and stare at Tru.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes are closed like they have been for the past four days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the swelling on her brain started to reduce, her eyes closed naturally, and now it just looks like she’s sleeping. My beautiful sleeping girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe good news is she’s breathing alone. Kish monitored her breathing and how much was assisted and unassisted for the first few days. Her unassisted breathing increased hourly, and when she reached 90 percent unassisted, Kish removed her ventilator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe assured me this was very positive for her recovery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to get my hopes up. But I’m afraid to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo for those four days, like the three before them, I have sat here waiting for her to open her eyes and tell me to stop boring the fuck out of her with the shit I spout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause that’s all I do, sit here and talk to Tru, waiting for her to wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAside from the regular visits to my son, I never leave her. My son, who is still waiting for his mom to wake up and name him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning forward, I reach over and take hold of her soft, warm hand. Her unresponsive hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Our boy is still waiting for his name, Tru, so you need to hurry and open those beautiful eyes of yours so you can choose it. It can even be one of those god-awful ones you were suggesting when we were trying to decide on names—you remember, sweetheart? What was that one you suggested? Skip? Fuckin’ Skip Wethers!” Shaking my head, I let out a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt echoes around the room and hits me back painfully in the chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing my eyes, I let my head hang back and I release a long sigh to the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ceiling that I close my eyes to every night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven’t stepped foot out of this hospital since the day of the accident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I do manage to sleep, it’s beside Tru on a bed I had brought in for me. The times I do eat, it’s in here with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fear wandering too far from this room in case she wakes. I have to be here when she opens her eyes. I have to be the first thing she sees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need her to know that I’m here for her, that I will always be here for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo here I wait. In a hospital, surrounded by medication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo I want a hit?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes. So very fucking badly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want the fear and pain that’s consuming me to disappear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fucking hate that I want drugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate that while my girl is lying in that bed, trying to fight her way back, I’m sitting here thinking about getting high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m a shitty excuse for a human being.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow can I think of drugs at a time like this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I’m a motherfucking bastard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I hate that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for me, it’s life. The addict will always live inside of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only resolve I have is that Tru doesn’t know just how much the addict still lives in me. And she’ll never know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t bear it if she did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently I’m still clean, and I want to keep it that way…but I can feel my resolve slipping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly two things are stopping me from taking a hit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne—my son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it’s not because I’m father of the fucking year. I wish I were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, it’s because I’m all he has right now. I know better than anyone what it feels like to be let down by your deadbeat drug addict of a father. I won’t be him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wethering-the-storm-the-storm-2/page-40.html","bookId":1999,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:31:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:31:55 PM"}
