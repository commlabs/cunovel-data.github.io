He was not sure he would succeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the initial explosion from D. O. Guerrero\u0027s dynamite bomb occurred, Gwen---next to Guerrero himself---was closest to the explosion\u0027s center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other circumstances she would have been killed instantly, as was D. O. Guerrero. Two things---for the moment---saved her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInterposed between Gwen and the explosion were Guerrero\u0027s body and the aircraft toilet door. Neither was an effective shield, yet the two together were sufficient to delay the blast\u0027s initial force the fraction of a second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin that fractional time the airplane\u0027s skin ripped, and the second explosion---explosive decompression---occurred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dynamite blast still struck Gwen, hurling her backward, gravely injured and bleeding, but its force now had an opposing force---the outward rush of air through the hole in the fuselage at the aircraft\u0027s rear. The effect was as if two tornadoes met head on. An instant later the decompression triumphed, sweeping the original explosion out with it into the high-altitude, darkened night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the forcefulness of the explosion, injuries were not widespread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGwen Meighen, the most critically hurt, lay unconscious in the aisle. Next to her, the owlish young man who had emerged from the toilet and startled Guerrero, was wounded, bleeding badly, and dazed, but still on his feet and conscious. A half dozen passengers nearby sustained cuts and contusions from splinters and bomb fragments. Others were struck, and stunned or bruised by hurtling objects impelled toward the aircraft\u0027s rear by the explosive decompression, but none of the latter injuries was major.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first, after decompression, all who were not secure in seats were impelled by suction toward the gaping hole in the aircraft\u0027s rear. From this danger, too, Gwen Meighen was in gravest peril. But she had fallen so that an arm---instinctively or accidentally---encircled a seat base. It prevented her from being dragged farther, and her body blocked others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the initial outrush of air, the suction lessened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, thc greatest immediate danger for all---injured or not---was lack of oxygen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough oxygen masks dropped promptly from their housings, only a handful of passengers had grasped and put them on at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore it was too late, however, a few people had acted. Stewardesses, responding to their training, and wherever they happened to be, seized masks and motioned others to do likewise. Three doctors, traveling with their wives as members of an off-season vacation tour, realized the need for speed, donned masks themselves and gave hasty instructions to those around them. Judy, the alert, eighteen-year-old niece of Customs Inspector Standish, placed a mask over the face of the baby in the seat beside her, as well as over her own. She then immediately signaled the baby\u0027s parents, and others across the aisle, to use oxygen. Mrs. Quonsett, the old lady stowaway, having observed oxygen demonstrations many times during her illegal flights, knew what to do. She took a mask herself and handed one to her friend, the oboe player, whom she pulled back into his seat beside her. Mrs. Quonsett had no idea if she was going to live or die, and found herself not greatly worried; but whatever happened, she intended to know what was going on until the very last moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone thrust a mask at the young man near Gwen who had been wounded. Though swaying, and scarcely aware of what was happening, he managed to hold it to his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven so, barely half the passengers were on oxygen at the end of fifteen seconds--the critical time. By then, those not breathing oxygen were lapsing into drowsy stupor; in another fifteen seconds, most were unconscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGwen Meighen received no oxygen, nor immediate help. The unconsciousness, caused by her injuries, deepened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, on the flight deck, Anson Harris, accepting the risk of further structural damage and possible total destruction of the aircraft, made his decision for a high speed dive, saving Gwen and others from asphyxiation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dive began at twenty-eight thousand feet altitude; it ended, two and a half minutes later, at ten thousand feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA human being can survive without oxygen for three to four minutes without damage to the brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first half of the dive---for a minute and a quarter, down to nineteen thousand feet---the air continued to be rarefied, and insufficient to support life. Below that point, increasing amounts of oxygen were present and breathable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt twelve thousand feet regular breathing was possible. By ten---with little time to spare, but enough---consciousness returned to all aboard Flight Two who had lost it, excepting Gwen. Many were unaware of having been unconscious at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGradually, as initial shock wore off, passengers and the remaining stewardesses took stock of their situation. The stewardess who was second in seniority after Gwen---a pert blonde from Oak Lawn, Illinois---hurried toward the injured at the rear. Though her face paled, she called urgently, \"Is there a doctor, please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, miss.\" Dr. Compagno had already moved from his seat without waiting to be called. A small, sharp-featured man who moved impatiently and talked quickly with a Brooklyn accent, he surveyed the scene hurriedly, conscious of the already biting cold, the wind streaming noisily through the gaping hole in the fuselage. Where the toilets and rear galley had been was a twisted mess of charred and bloodstained wood and metal. The back of the fuselage to the interior of the tail was open, with control wires and structural assemblies exposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor raised his voice to make himself heard above the noise of wind and engines, constant and encompassing now that the cabin was no longer sealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suggest you move as many people as you can nearer the front. Keep everyone as warm as possible. We\u0027ll need blankets for those who are hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stewardess said doubtfully, \"I\u0027ll try to find some.\" Many of the blankets normally stored in overhead racks had been swept out, along with passengers\u0027 extra clothing and other objects, in the whirlwind of decompression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two other doctors from Dr. Compagno\u0027s tour party joined him. One instructed another stewardess, \"Bring us all the first aid equipment you have.\" Compagno---already on his knees beside Gwen---was the only one of the three with a medical bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrying a bag with emergency supplies wherever he went was characteristic of Milton Compagno. So was taking charge now, even though---as a G.P.---he was outranked professionally by the other two doctors who were internists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilton Compagno never considered himself off duty. Thirty-five years ago, as a young man who had fought an upward battle from a New York slum, he hung out a shingle in Chicago\u0027s Little Italy, near MHwaukee and Grand Avenues. Since then---as his wife told it, usually with resignation---the only time he ceased practicing medicine was while he slept. He enjoyed being needed. He acted as if his profession were a prize he had won, which, if not guarded, would slip away. He had never been known to refuse to see a patient at any hour, or to fail to make a house call if sent for. He never drove past an accident scene as did many of his medical brethren, fearing malpractice suits; he always stopped, got out of his car, and did what he could. He kept conscientiously up to date. Yet the more he worked, the more he seemed to thrive. He gave the impression of running through each day as if he planned to assuage the world\u0027s ailments in a lifetime, of which too little was left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe journey to Rome---many years postponed---was to visit the birthplace of his parents. With his wife, Dr. Compagno was to be away a month, and because he was growing old, he had agreed that the time should be a total rest. Yet he fully anticipated that somewhere en route, or perhaps in Italy (never mind regulations about not being licensed) he would be needed. If so, he was ready. It did not surprise him that he was needed now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved first to Gwen who was clearly most critical among those hurt. He told his colleagues, over his shoulder, \"You attend to the others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the narrow aisle, Dr. Compagno turned Gwen over partially, leaning forward to detect if she was breathing. She was, but her breath was light and shallow. He called to the stewardess he had been speaking to, \"I need oxygen down here.\" While the girl brought a portable bottle and mask, he checked Gwen\u0027s mouth for an unobstructed airway; there were smashed teeth, which he removed, and a good deal of blood; he made sure the bleeding was not preventing respiration. He told the stewardess, \"Hold the mask in place.\" The oxygen hissed. Within a minute or two a vestige of color returned to Gwen\u0027s skin, which had been ominously white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, he began to control bleeding, extensive around the face and chest. Working quickly, he used a hemostat to clamp off a facial artery---worst site of external hemorrhage---and pressure dressings elsewhere. He had already detected a probable fracture of the clavicle and left arm, which would need to be splinted later. He was distressed to see what appeared to be splinters from the explosion in the patient\u0027s left eye; he was less sure about the right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecond Officer Jordan, having moved carefully around Dr. Compagno and Gwen, took charge of the remaining stewardesses and was supervising the movement of passengers forward in the aircraft. As many tourist passengers as possible were being moved into the first class section, some squeezed in, two to a seat, others directed to the small, semicircular first class lounge, where spare seats were available. Such extra clothing as remained was distributed among those who appeared to need it most, without regard to ownership. As always, in such situations, people showed a willingness to help one another, unselfishness, and even flashes of humor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other two doctors were bandaging passengers who had received cuts, none excessively serious. The young man with glasses, who was behind Gwen at the moment of the explosion, had a deep gash in one arm, but it could be repaired and would heal. He had other minor cuts about the face and shoulders. For the time being, pressure dressings were applied to his injured arm, and he was given morphine, while being made as comfortable and warm as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth the medical attention and movement of passengers was being made more difficult by heavy buffeting which the aircraft, at its present low altitude, was taking from the storm. There was constant turbulence, punctuated every few minutes by violent pitching or sideways movements. Several passengers were finding airsickness added to their other troubles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter reporting to the flight deck for the second time, Cy Jordan returned to Dr. Compagno.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doctor, Captain Demerest asked me to say he\u0027s grateful for everything you and the other doctors are doing. When you can spare a moment, he\u0027d appreciate it if you\u0027d come to the flight deck to tell him what to radio ahead about casualties.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold this dressing,\" Dr. Compagno ordered. \"Press down hard, right there. Now I want you to help me with a splint. We\u0027ll use one of those leather magazine covers, with a towel under it. Get the biggest cover you can find, and leave the magazine in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later: \"I\u0027ll come when I can. You can say to your captain that I think, as soon as possible, he should make an announcement to the passengers. People are getting over their shock. They could use some reassurance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\" Cy Jordan looked down at the still unconscious figure of Gwen, his normally mournful, hollow-cheeked face accentuated by concern. \"Is there a chance for her, Doc?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a chance, son, though I wouldn\u0027t say it was the best. A lot depends on her own strength.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I always figured she had a lot of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A pretty girl, wasn\u0027t she?\" Amid the torn flesh, blood, and dirty, tousled hair, it was difficult to be sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompagno remained silent. Whatever happened, the girl on the floor would not be pretty any more---not without plastic surgery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll give the captain your message, sir.\" Looking a little sicker than before, Cy Jordan went forward to the flight deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVernon Demerest\u0027s voice came calmly on the cabin p.a. system a few moments later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ladies and gentlemen, this is Captain Demerest...\" To overcome the roar of wind and engines, Cy Jordan had turned the volume control to \"full.\" Each word rang clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know we\u0027ve had trouble---bad trouble. I won\u0027t attempt to minimize it. I won\u0027t make any jokes either, because up here on the flight deck we don\u0027t see anything that\u0027s funny, and I imagine you feel the same way. We\u0027ve all come through an experience which none of us in the crew has ever had before, and I hope will never have again. But we have come through. Now, we have the airplane under control, we\u0027re turned around, and expect to land at Lincoln International in about three quarters of an hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the two passenger cabins, where first and tourist class now mingled without distinction, movement and conversation stopped. Eyes instinctively went to the overhead speakers as everyone within hearing strained to miss nothing of what was said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, of course, that the airplane is damaged. But it\u0027s also true that the damage could have been a whole lot worse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the flight deck, with the p.a. mike in hand, Vernon Demerest wondered how specific---and how honest---he should be. On his own regular flights he always kept captain-to-passengers announcements to the barest terse minimum. He disapproved of \"long-playing captains\" who bombarded their captive audience with assorted commentaries from a flight\u0027s beginning to its end. He sensed, though, that this time he should say more, and that passengers were entitled to be told the true situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t conceal from you,\" Demerest said into the microphone, \"that we have a few problems still ahead of us. Our landing will be heavy, and we\u0027re not sure how the damage we\u0027ve suffered will affect it. I\u0027m telling you this because right after this announcement the crew will start giving instructions on how to sit, and how to brace yourselves, just before we land. Another thing you\u0027ll be told is how to get out of the airplane in a hurry, if we need to, right after landing. If that should happen, please act calmly but quickly, and obey instructions given you by any member of the crew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me assure you that on the ground everything necessary is being done to help us.\" Remembering their need for runway three zero, Demerest hoped it was true. He also decided there was no point in going into detail about the problem of the jammed stabilizer; most passengers wouldn\u0027t understand it anyway. With a touch of lightness in his voice, he added, \"In one way you\u0027re lucky tonight because instead of one experienced captain on the flight deck, it just so happens you have two---Captain Harris and myself. We\u0027re a couple of ancient pelicans with more years of flying than we sometimes like to think about---except right now when all that combined experience comes in mighty useful. We\u0027ll be helping each other, along with Second Officer Jordan. who\u0027ll also be spending part of his time back with you. Please help us too. If you do, I promise you we\u0027ll come through this together---safely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemerest replaced the p.a. mike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout taking his eyes from the flight instruments, Anson Harris remarked, \"That was pretty good. You should be in politics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemerest said sourly, \"Nobody\u0027d vote for me. Most times, people don\u0027t like plain talking and the truth.\" He was remembering bitterly the Board of Airport Commissioners meeting at Lincoln International where he urged curtailment of airport insurance vending. Plain speech there had proved disastrous. He wondered how the members of the Board, including his smooth, smug brother-in-law, would feet after learning about D. 0. Guerrero\u0027s purchase of insurance and his maniacal intention to destroy Flight Two. Probably, Demerest thought, they would be complacent as ever, except that now instead of saying It will never happen, they would say, Well, assuming Flight Two made it back safely, and whatever was said or wasn\u0027t, sure as hell he was going to create another big fight about airport insurance vending. The difference was: this time more people would listen. Tonight\u0027s near disaster, however it turned out, was certain to attract a lot of press attention; he would make the most of it. He would talk bluntly to reporters about flight insurance, about the Lincoln airport commissioners, and not least about his precious brother-in-law, Mel Bakersfeld. Trans America\u0027s public relations flacks would do their damnedest, of course, to keep him incommunicado \"in the interests of company policy.\" Just let them try!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe radio crackled alive. \"Trans America Two, this is Cleveland Center. Lincoln advises runway three zero still temporarily out of use. They are attempting to clear obstruction before you arrive. Failing that, will land you on two five.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarris\u0027s face went grim as Demerest acknowledged. Runway two five was two thousand feet shorter, as well as narrower, and at the moment with a bad crosswind. Using it would compound the hazards they already faced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemerest\u0027s expression clearly reflected his reaction to the message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were still being thrown about severely by the storm. Most of Harris\u0027s time was occupied by holding the aircraft reasonably steady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemerest swung around to the second officer. \"Cy, go back with the passengers again, and take charge. See that the girls demonstrate the landing drill, and that everybody understands it. Then pick some key people who look reliable. Make sure they know where emergency exits are and how to use them. If we run out of runway, which\u0027ll be for sure if we use two five, everything may come apart in a hurry. If that happens we\u0027ll all try to make it back there and help, but there may not be time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\" Once more, Jordan eased out of his flight engineer\u0027s seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemerest, still anxious for news of Gwen, would have preferred to go himself, but at this stage neither he nor Harris could leave the flight deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Cy Jordan left, Dr. Compagno arrived. It was now easier to move into and from the flight deck, since Jordan had moved the smashed entrance door to one side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilton Compagno introduced himself briskly to Vernon Demerest. \"Captain, I have the report of injuries you asked for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re grateful to you, Doctor. If you hadn\u0027t been here...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompagno waved a hand in dismissal. \"Let\u0027s do all that later.\" He opened a leather-covered notebook where a slim gold pencil marked a page. It was characteristic that he had already obtained names, and recorded injuries and treatment. \"Your stewardess, Miss Meighen, is the most badly hurt. She has multiple lacerations of the face and chest, with considerable bleeding. There is a compound fracture of the left arm and, of course, shock. Also, please notify whoever is making arrangements on the ground that an ophthalmic surgeon should be available immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVernon Demerest, his face paler than usual, had been steeling himself to copy the doctor\u0027s information onto the flight log clipboard. Now, with sudden shock, he stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An ophthalmic surgeon! You mean... her eyes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid so,\" Dr. Compagno said gravely. He corrected himself. \"At least, her left eye has splinters, whether wood or metal I\u0027ve no means of knowing. It will require a specialist to decide if the retina is affected. The right eye, as far as I can tell, is unharmed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God!\" Feeling physically sick, Demerest put a hand to his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Compagno shook his head. \"It\u0027s too early to draw conclusions. Modem ophthalmic surgery can do extraordinary things. But time will be important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll send all you\u0027ve told us on company radio,\" Anson Harris assured him. \"They\u0027ll have time to be ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027d better give you the rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMechanically, Demerest wrote down the remainder of the doctor\u0027s report. Compared with Gwen\u0027s injuries, those of other passengers were slight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d better get back,\" Dr. Compagno said. \"To see if there\u0027s any change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemerest said abruptly, \"Don\u0027t go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor stopped, his expression curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gwen... that is, Miss Meighen...\" Demerest\u0027s voice sounded strained and awkward, even to himself. \"She was... is... pregnant. Does it make any difference?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw Anson Harris glance sideways in startled surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor answered, a shade defensively, \"I had no means of knowing. The pregnancy can\u0027t be very far advanced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Demerest avoided the other man\u0027s eyes. \"It isn\u0027t.\" A few minutes earlier he had resolved not to ask the question. Then he decided that he had to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMilton Compagno considered. \"It will make no difference to her own ability to recover, of course. As to the child, the mother was not deprived of oxygen long enough to do harm... no one was. She has no abdominal injuries.\" He stopped, then went on fussily, \"So there should be no effect. Providing Miss Meighen survives---and with prompt hospital treatment her chances are fair to good---the baby should be born normally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemerest nodded without speaking. Dr. Compagno, after a moment\u0027s hesitation, left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBriefly, between the two captains, there was a silence. Anson Harris broke it. \"Vernon, I\u0027d like to rest before I make the landing. Will you fly for a while?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemerest nodded, his hands and feet moving automatically to the controls. He was grateful for the absence of questioning or comment about Gwen. Whatever Harris was thinking or wondering, he had the decency to keep it to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarris reached for the clipboard containing Dr. Compagno\u0027s information. \"I\u0027ll send that.\" He switched radio receivers to call Trans America dispatch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Vernon Demerest the act of flying was a physical relief after the shock and emotion of what he had just heard. Possibly Harris had considered that, possibly not. Either way, it made sense that whoever was in command for the landing should conserve his energies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs to the landing, hazardous as it was going to be, Anson Harris obviously assumed he would make it. Demerest---on the basis of Harris\u0027s performance so far---saw no reason why he should not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarris completed his radio call, then eased his seat rearward and allowed his body to rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside him, Vernon Demerest tried to concentrate solely on flying. He did not succeed. To a pilot of experience and skill, total concentration during level flight---even in difficult circumstances, as now---was neither usual nor necessary. Though he tried to banish or postpone them, thoughts of Gwen persisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGwen... whose chance of remaining alive was \"fair to good,\" who tonight had been bright and beautiful and full of promise, would never go to Naples now, as they had planned... Gwen, who an hour or two ago had told him in her clear, sweet English voice,I happen to love you... Gwen, whom he loved in return, despite himself, and why not face it?...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith grief and anguish he visualized her---injured, unconscious, and carrying his child; the child he urged her to dispose of like an unwanted litter... She had replied with spirit, I was wondering when you\u0027d get around to it... Later she had been troubled. It\u0027s a gift... that\u0027s great and wonderful. Then suddenly, in our kind of situation you\u0027re faced with ending it all, of squandering what was given.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut eventually, after his persuading, she conceded, Well, I suppose in the end I\u0027ll do what\u0027s sensible. I\u0027ll have an abortion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere would be no abortion now, In the kind of hospital Gwen was going to, it would not be permitted unless as a direct choice between saving the mother or the unborn child. From what Dr. Compagno had said, there seemed no likelihood of that; and afterward it would be too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo if Gwen came through, the baby would be born. Was he relieved or sorry? Vernon Demerest wasn\u0027t sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered something else, though, that Gwen had said. The difference between you and me is that you\u0027ve had a child... whatever happens there\u0027s always someone, somewhere that\u0027s you again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had been speaking of the child whom he had never known, even by name; the girl child, born in the limbo of the Trans America 3-PPP arrangements, who had disappeared from sight immediately and forever. Tonight, under questioning, he admitted that sometimes he wondered about her. What he had not admitted was that he wondered, and remembered, more often than he cared to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis unknown daughter was eleven years old; Demerest knew her birthday, though he tried not to remember it, but always did, wishing the same thing each year: that there was something he could do--- even a simple thing like sending a greeting... He supposed it was because he and Sarah had never had a child (though both had wanted children) whose birthday he could share... At other times he asked himself questions to which he knew there could be no answers: Where was his daughter? What was she like? Was she happy? Sometimes he looked at children in the streets; if their ages seemed right, he speculated on whether, by merest chance... then chided himself for foolishness. Occasionally the thought haunted him that his daughter might be ill-treated, or need help which he had no knowledge or means to give... At the instinctive reminder, now, Vernon Demerest\u0027s hands tightened on the control yoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time he realized: he could never endure the same uncertainty again. His own nature demanded positiveness. He could, and would, have gone through with the abortion because that was final, definite; moreover, nothing Anson Harris had said earlier on that subject had changed his mind. True, he might have doubts, or even sorrow, afterward. But he would know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe overhead radio speaker cut abruptly through his thoughts. \"Trans America Two, this is Cleveland Center. Turn left on heading two zero five. Begin descent, when ready, to six thousand. Advise when leaving ten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemerest\u0027s hand pulled back all four throttles to begin losing altitude. He reset the flight path indicator and eased into the turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trans America Two coming on course two zero five,\" Anson Harris was advising Cleveland. \"We are leaving ten thousand now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe buffeting increased as they descended, but with every minute they were nearer destination and the hope of safety. They were also nearing the air route boundary point where, at any moment, Cleveland would hand them over to Chicago Center. After that, there would be thirty minutes flying before entering the approach control of Lincoln friternational.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarris said quietly, \"Vernon, I guess you know how badly I feel about Gwen.\" He hesitated. \"Whatever\u0027s between the two of you is none of my business, but if there\u0027s anything I can do as a friend...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing,\" Demerest said. He had no intention of unburdening himself to Anson Harris, who was a competent pilot, but still, in Demerest\u0027s eyes, an old maid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemerest regretted now that he had revealed as much as he did a few minutes ago, but emotion got the better of him---something which happened rarely. Now, he let his face resume a scowl, his shield against disclosing personal feelings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Passing through eight thousand feet,\" Anson Harris told air route control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemerest continued to hold the aircraft in a steady descent, on course. His eyes swept the flight instruments in consistent sequence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered something about the child---his child---who had been born eleven years ago. For weeks before the birth, he debated with himself whether he should confess his infidelity to Sarah, with the suggestion that they adopt the baby as their own. In the end, his courage had failed him. He dreaded his wife\u0027s shocked reaction; he feared that Sarah would never accept the child, whose presence she would regard as a permanent reproach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong after, and too late, he realized he had done Sarali an injustice. True, she would have been shocked and hurt, just as she would be shocked and hurt now, if she learned about Gwen. But afterward, in a short time, Sarah\u0027s habit of coping would have taken over. For all Sarah\u0027s placidity and what Demerest thought of as her dullness, despite her suburban bourgeois activities---the curling Club and amateur oil painting---his wife had a core of sane solidity. He supposed it was why they had stayed married; why, even now, he could not contemplate divorce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSarah would have worked something out. She would have made him squirm and suffer for a while, perhaps for a long time. But she would have agreed to the adoption, and the one who would not have suffered at all would have been the child. Sarah would have seen to that; she was that kind of person. He thought: if only...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemerest said aloud, \"Life\u0027s full of goddamned \u0027if onlys.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leveled out at six thousand feet, advancing the throttles to maintain speed. The jet whine rose in pitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarris had been busy changing radio frequencies and---now they had passed the handoff point---reporting to Chicago Center. He asked, \"Did you say something?\" Demerest shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe storm\u0027s turbulence was as bad as ever, the aircraft still being thrown around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trans America Two, we have you in radar contact,\" a new voice from Chicago Center rasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarris was still attending to communications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVernon Demerest reasoned: So far as Gwen was concerned, he might just as well make a decision now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right, he decided; he would face Sarah\u0027s tears and denunciations, and perhaps her anger, but he would tell her about Gwen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would admit his responsibdity for Gwen\u0027s pregnancy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt home, the resulting hysteria might last several days and the aftereffects for weeks or even months, during which time he would suffer mightily. But when the worst was over they would work something out. Strangely---and he supposed it showed his confidence in Sarah---he had not the slightest doubt they would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no idea what they might do, and a good deal would depend on Gwen. Despite what the doctor had just said about the seriousness of Gwen\u0027s injuries, Demerest had a conviction she would come through. Gwen had spunk and courage; even unconsciously she would fight to live, and eventually, whatever impairment she suffered, would adjust to it. She would also have her own ideas about the baby. She might not give it up easily or at all. Gwen was not one to be pushed around, or to be told what to do. She did her own thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe result might be that he would have two women on his hands---plus child---instead of one. That would take some working out!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would also pose the question: just how far would Sarah go?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod!---what a mess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now that his own first decision was taken, he had the conviction that something good might result. He reflected grimly: For all it was going to cost him, in anguish and hard cash, it better had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe unwinding altimeter showed they were passing through five thousand feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere would be the child, of course. Already be was beginning to think of that part in a new and different way. Naturally, he wouldn\u0027t let himself get sickly sentimental, the way some people---Anson Harris, for example---were about children; but it would be his child, after all. The experience would certainly be new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was it Gwen had said in the car on their way to the airport tonight?... a little Vernon Demerest inside me. If we had a boy we could call him Vernon Demerest, Junior, the way Americans do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it wasn\u0027t such a bad idea. He chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarris glanced sideways. \"What are you laughing at?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemerest exploded. \"I\u0027m not laughing! Why the hell would I laugh? What is there for any of us to laugh about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarris shrugged, \"I thought I heard you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the second time you\u0027ve heard things that didn\u0027t happen. After this check ride I suggest you have an ear checkup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no need to be unpleasant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t there? Isn\u0027t there?\" Demerest came angrily alert. \"Maybe what this whole situation needs is for someone to get unpleasant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If that\u0027s true,\" Harris said, \"there\u0027s no one better qualified than you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then when you\u0027re through with damnfool questions, start flying again, and let me talk to those duffers on the ground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnson Harris slid his seat forward. \"If you want to, why not?\" He nodded. \"I have it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelinquishing the controls, Demerest reached for the radio mike. He felt better, stronger, for a decision taken. Now he would contend with more immediate things. He let his voice grate harshly. \"Chicago Center, this is Captain Demerest of Trans America Two. Are you still listening down there, or have you taken sleeping pills and quit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Chicago Center, Captain. We\u0027re listening, and no one\u0027s quit.\" The controllers voice held a note of reproach; Demerest ignored it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why in blazes aren\u0027t we getting action? This flight is in serious trouble. We need help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stand by, please.\" There was a pause, then a new voice. \"This is Chicago Center supervisor. Captain, Trans America Two, I heard your last transmission. Please understand we\u0027re doing everything we can. Before you came into our area we had a dozen people working, clearing other traffic. They\u0027re still doing it. We\u0027re giving you priority, a clear radio frequency, and a straight-in course for Lincoln.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemerest barked, \"It isn\u0027t enough.\" He paused, holding down the mike button, then continued. \"Chicago supervisor, listen carefully. A straight-in course to Lincoln is no good if it ends on runway two five, or any runway except three zero. Don\u0027t tell me three zero\u0027s out of use; I\u0027ve heard it already, and I know why. Now, write this down, and see that Lincoln understands it too: This airplane is heavily loaded; we\u0027ll be landing very fast. As well as that, we\u0027ve structural damage including unserviceable stabilizer trim and doubtful rudder control. If we\u0027re broutzht in on two five, there\u0027ll be a broken airplane and dead people before the next hour is over. So call Lincoln, mister, and turn the screws. Tell them I don\u0027t care how they do it---they can blow apart what\u0027s blocking three zero if they have to---but we need that runway. Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Trans America Two, we understand very well.\" The supervisor\u0027s voice was unruffled, but a shade more human than before. \"Your message is being passed to Lincoln now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" Demerest held the transmit button down again. \"I have another message. This one is to Mel Bakersfeld, airport General manager at Lincoln. Give him the previous message, then add this---personal from his brother-in-law: \u0027You helped make this trouble, you bastard, by not listening to me about airport flight insurance. Now you owe it to me and all others on this flight to climb off your penguin\u0027s butt and get that runway clear.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time the supervisor\u0027s voice was doubtful. \"Trans America Two, we\u0027ve copied your message. Captain, are you sure you want us to use those words?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chicago Center,\" Demerest\u0027s voice slammed back, \"you\u0027re damn right you\u0027ll use those words! I\u0027m ordering you to send that message---fast, and loud, and clear.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/airport/page-36.html","bookId":1522,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:45:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:45:00 AM"}
