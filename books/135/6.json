The night waspitch black. It thundered, and bright flashes of lightningnow and again shot across the sky, turning it into a sea offire. An angry wind blew cold and raised dense clouds ofdust, while the trees shook and moaned in a weird way.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Pinocchio was greatly afraid of thunder and lightning,but the hunger he felt was far greater than his fear. In adozen leaps and bounds, he came to the village, tired out,puffing like a whale, and with tongue hanging.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　The whole village was dark and deserted. The storeswere closed, the doors, the windows. In the streets, noteven a dog could be seen. It seemed the Village of theDead.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Pinocchio, in desperation, ran up to a doorway, threwhimself upon the bell, and pulled it wildly, saying to himself:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Someone will surely answer that!\"He was right. An old man in a nightcap opened thewindow and looked out. He called down angrily:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"What do you want at this hour of night?\"\"Will you be good enough to give me a bit of bread?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　I am hungry.\"\"Wait a minute and I\u0027ll come right back,\" answered theold fellow, thinking he had to deal with one of those boyswho love to roam around at night ringing people\u0027s bellswhile they are peacefully asleep.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　After a minute or two, the same voice cried:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Get under the window and hold out your hat!\"Pinocchio had no hat, but he managed to get under thewindow just in time to feel a shower of ice-cold waterpour down on his poor wooden head, his shoulders, andover his whole body.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　He returned home as wet as a rag, and tired out fromweariness and hunger.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　As he no longer had any strength left with which tostand, he sat down on a little stool and put his two feet onthe stove to dry them.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　There he fell asleep, and while he slept, his woodenfeet began to burn. Slowly, very slowly, they blackenedand turned to ashes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　Pinocchio snored away happily as if his feet were nothis own. At dawn he opened his eyes just as a loud knockingsounded at the door.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"Who is it?\" he called, yawning and rubbing his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　\"It is I,\" answered a voice.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e　　It was the voice of Geppetto.\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/327/3145.html","bookId":135,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 4:59:52 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 4:59:52 AM"}
