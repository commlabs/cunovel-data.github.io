He blamed that on Faith Bennett. The girl he\u0027d loved with the wild, intense passion only experienced in adolescence. The girl he had slaked all his raging teenage hormones on every chance he could. The girl he\u0027d fully intended to marry and spend the rest of his life spoiling with the sort of expensive gifts, cars, and homes her struggling family couldn\u0027t afford.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e...until she\u0027d kicked him to the curb the day after his high school graduation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiguel pulled the keys from the ignition of the sleek BMW coupe he\u0027d rented at the airport, then slid out from behind the wheel. He took off his sunglasses and stared at the auto shop in front of him. Bennett and Sons Garage looked better than he\u0027d ever seen it. Fresh tan and forest green paint spoke of steady business, as did the number of cars in the service area. They\u0027d expanded at some point, taking over the lot next door that used to be a paint shop. He\u0027d noted on the drive over that the neighborhood had been revitalized. So much had changed in the eleven years since he\u0027d left Rio Penasquitos. He\u0027d changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut his memories of Faith remained the same - fierce and heated. Powerful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowerful enough to bring him face-to-face with a woman he\u0027d sworn never to see again. He\u0027d finally accepted that he wasn\u0027t moving forward because part of him was still clinging to the past. Like every other memory from high school, his recollections were stained by the perceived omnipotence of youth and he\u0027d realized what he had to do. He needed to see Faith again, with an experienced man\u0027s eyes, so he could finally cut through the nostalgia and close that chapter of his past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe headed to the waiting room. Grabbing the metal handle of the glass door, Miguel stepped into the cool air conditioning and smiled absently at those who filled the chairs in the expansive space. A mother was walking her son to the vending machine, an older gentleman was reading a copy of Forbes that just happened to have Miguel\u0027s dad on the cover, and a couple college-age kids were laughing over something they were watching on an iPhone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good news, Mr. Sullivan,\" a husky voice called from behind the service counter. \"You don\u0027t need a new radiator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiguel froze, his body tensing. He dreamed of that voice sometimes. Relived occasions when it had teased him, taunted him, begged him...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst loves were heady; everyone knew that. But his had been soaked with insanely combustible lust. A desire so hot it had seared into his brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe exhaled harshly and got a grip on himself. He\u0027d been a kid then, highly-sexed and blessed with a lush, sensual girlfriend. It would be different now. He had control of his dick and libido.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaith appeared at the counter, her gaze on her hands as she pulled off the latex gloves she wore while working. She was dressed in a baggy blue jumpsuit and her long, dark hair was clipped up, effectively subduing her sexiest assets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiguel\u0027s cock didn\u0027t mind. It thickened and lengthened with rousing appreciation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoddammit... She was still hot as hell. Full-lipped, blue-eyed, honey-skinned. A fucking walking wet dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Sullivan set down the issue of Forbes and stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your radiator hose - \" Her gaze caught on Miguel. She paled and reached for the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood riveted, rocked by desire so ferocious he could barely string two thoughts together. His brain got as far as him leaping over the counter and dragging her to the floor, then it shorted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Radiator hose sprung a leak?\" Mr. Sullivan asked, approaching her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaith visibly shook off her shock and glanced at her customer. \"Yes. I replaced it and refilled your coolant reservoir. Angela will type up the repair order and check you out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe managed a tight smile before pivoting and walking back out of the half-door leading to the service bays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last time she\u0027d turned her back to him had been the last time he saw her. She\u0027d slid out of his bed in all her naked glory, her passion-flushed skin on display, her generous curves reigniting the lust she\u0027d sated just a few moments before. Faith fought and fucked with no restraint, and he\u0027d learned to just hang on and enjoy the ride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve had a good time together,\" she\u0027d said, looking over her shoulder with a cool smile. \"I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll miss you now and then after you\u0027re gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo years together, and she dropped him like a forgettable one-night stand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no idea how long she\u0027d been planning on dumping him. From the beginning? She did it so blithely he knew he\u0027d meant little to her for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGalvanized by his remembered pain, humiliation, and simmering fury, Miguel stepped outside to wait. A moment later, she joined him from the nearest bay, her lips slicked with pinkish gloss. He wondered if she still favored the strawberry-flavored stuff. He used to love nibbling it off her mouth. And seeing the pink stain of it ringing his cock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miguel.\" She blew out her breath in a rush. \"I didn\u0027t know you were in town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just pulled in.\" Literally. He hadn\u0027t stopped for gas or food, or said hi to his mother, who was expecting him to stay with her. He\u0027d been planning on doing just that, until he saw Faith. Now, he would be getting a hotel room. Clearly just seeing her wasn\u0027t going to do the trick. He\u0027d have to nail her to get the job done, to prove to his infatuated brain and unruly dick that she didn\u0027t have a golden, magical pussy. Sure it had felt that way at seventeen, when he\u0027d had only a half-dozen girls in his sexual history and Faith had been the most precious thing in the world. He was thirty now and he\u0027d had his share of women who knew how to wring a guy out in the sack. He just had to get past comparing new memories to faulty old ones. Similar to remembering an amusement park roller coaster as being wildly exhilarating, only to ride it again as an adult and realize it isn\u0027t all that when you\u0027re three times the size and a lot more jaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d soon be riding Faith again and gaining the same perspective. If she wasn\u0027t married or attached to a significant other...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gut knotted. He couldn\u0027t tell by looking at her hand; she didn\u0027t wear rings for safety reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You came here first?\" Her blue eyes gave nothing away. As hot as she was, she was also cool and controlled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept when she was beneath him. There had been nothing controlled or cool about her then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought I\u0027d take you to dinner.\" He affected an easy smile. No simple task when he was furiously aroused, his entire body hard with need. \"For old time\u0027s sake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked him over, her gaze raking him from head to toe with a long, leisurely pause on his raging hard-on. He crossed his arms and widened his stance, his jaw clenching as the button-fly of his jeans dug into his straining cock. It fucking killed him that she could still affect him this way. He\u0027d had a lot of beautiful women, but only Faith made him feel like he might die if he didn\u0027t get inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take me to dinner?\" she repeated. \"Or take me to bed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Both.\" He refused to feel vulnerable for stating his intentions. Just because he was hot to fuck her didn\u0027t mean she had the power to hurt him. Hiding anything would suggest wariness and he wasn\u0027t going to give her that ammunition. She could shred him just fine without any help. \"Or just the latter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer chin lifted. \"Do you have a significant other in your life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t be propositioning you if I was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No girlfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fiance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiguel looked for any sign that his responses pleased or displeased her. She revealed nothing. His dick throbbed in time with the pounding beat of his heart. \"You?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waved the question off with marked impatience. \"Where should I meet you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer desire to have an escape vehicle aggravated him, which he didn\u0027t hide with his curtness. \"Mezaluna work for you? I\u0027ll pick you up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s gone. The Torettos moved a few years ago. They wanted a quiet little restaurant, so when things got busy around here, they moved on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRio Penasquitos hadn\u0027t even been a spot on the map when he\u0027d left, but it had grown into a quaint tourist destination and vacation spot for the wealthy. That was due in part to his mother, a trophy wife who\u0027d returned to her home town to raise her only child and brought media attention with her. \"Why don\u0027t you pick me up at the bed and breakfast,\" he challenged, \"and we\u0027ll figure it out from there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer foot lifted, her leg moving restlessly. His gaze narrowed on that telltale movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" she said finally. \"What time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seven?\" He remembered the shop closed at five. Expectation thrummed through him, a heated awareness that made a joke of the casual interaction they were pretending this was. Tension was strung tight between them, vibrating in the air with the energy of an approaching thunderstorm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t indifferent to him. He wondered if he\u0027d possibly ruined her, too. Just a little. While he couldn\u0027t imagine any man not taking the time to savor her body for hours, he knew damn well that no one could possibly love her as completely as he once had. Even the man he was today was incapable of that depth of emotion and connection. She\u0027d killed the innocence in him that had made it possible to love a woman without any thought of self-preservation. He\u0027d been wide open when she cut his heart out and scars had formed, creating a thick shield that he couldn\u0027t get past and no woman could get through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see you then.\" She backed up toward the garage. \"You look good, Miguel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do you.\" Good? She looked edible. His mouth was damn near watering with the anticipation of tasting her again. If there hadn\u0027t been a dozen auto technicians around, he would have kissed off waiting until seven and taken what he wanted now. As it was, there was no conveniently private place on the lot to eat her sweet pussy, which is exactly what he\u0027d do once he got his lips on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad you came by,\" she said softly, holding his gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bared his teeth in a smile. He didn\u0027t want to be placated. He wanted a rushed dinner followed by unrushed sex that would pale in comparison to his exaggerated recollections. Then he\u0027d leave the past behind where it belonged. \"So... did you end up missing me now and then?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/all-revved-up-dangerous-1/page-1.html","bookId":1920,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:01 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:01 AM"}
