I know Sidney Sheldon. He\u0027s handsomer and taller than you, and he\u0027s a great juggler. Can you juggle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Marx - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t call me Mr. Marx.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you like to be called?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sally. I\u0027ve read some of the things you\u0027ve done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. You ought to be ashamed of yourself.\" He looked me over again. \"You\u0027re too thin. Whoever you are, you and your wife should come to my house tomorrow night for dinner. Eight o\u0027clock. And don\u0027t be late again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI introduced Jorja to Groucho and there was an instant rapport. That was the beginning of our lifelong relationship with Groucho.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Groucho\u0027s dinner parties, there were always some of Groucho\u0027s lines for his guests to quote: \"I find television very educational. Every time someone turns it on, I go into the other room and read a book.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Outside of a dog, a book is a man\u0027s best friend. Inside of a dog, it\u0027s too dark to read.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a wonderful evening, but this wasn\u0027t it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marriage is a wonderful institution, but who wants to live in an institution?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce, he had to visit a doctor. A beautiful young nurse came up to him and said, \"The doctor will see you now. Walk this way.\" Groucho looked at her swaying hips and said, \"If I could walk that way, I wouldn\u0027t have to see a doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe saw Groucho often and as we got to know him, I realized that people didn\u0027t really understand him. When he insulted them, they thought it was funny. They felt rather proud to be the object of his wit. What they didn\u0027t realize was that Groucho meant everything he said. He was a misanthrope and was completely honest about his feelings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had had a bitter childhood. He was pulled out of school when he was seven and he and his brothers went to the stage. The Marx Brothers made fourteen pictures together. Groucho made five more on his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGroucho and I were walking down Rodeo Drive one day and a man came running up to Groucho and said, \"Groucho, do you remember me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTypical of his attitude toward people, Groucho turned on him. \"What have you ever done that I should remember you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGroucho had a very successful television show that was on the air for an incredible eleven years. It was called You Bet Your Life. It was a hit because no one knew what he was going to say next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne night, a contestant on the show told Groucho that he had ten children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why so many?\" Groucho asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like my wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGroucho said, \"I like my cigar, but I take it out sometimes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day, Groucho\u0027s daughter, Melinda, who was then eight, was invited to a country club by a classmate. They put on bathing suits and went into the swimming pool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe manager of the club came running up and said to Melinda, \"You\u0027ll have to get out of the pool. We don\u0027t allow Jews here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Melinda ran home, crying, and told her father what had happened, Groucho got the manager of the club on the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re being unfair,\" Groucho said. \"My daughter is only half Jewish. Is it all right if she goes in the pool up to her waist?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGroucho was married to Eden Hartford, a young actress, and Jorja and I were supposed to have dinner with them one night. Eden had an early call at the studio the next day, and Jorja also had an early call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGroucho telephoned me. \"It\u0027s just the two of us for dinner. How do you want me to dress?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Groucho, we\u0027re going to a nice restaurant, so don\u0027t embarrass me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I picked him up at his house and rang the bell, he opened the door wearing Eden\u0027s skirt and blouse and high-heeled shoes and smoking his cigar. I didn\u0027t take any notice of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Would you like to come in for a drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe went into the den and Groucho mixed drinks for us. The doorbell rang. What he had forgotten was that he had a date with some television executives to talk about his show. He opened the door and invited them in and we sat chatting for a while and they left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll change,\" Groucho said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we went out to dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone in show business has the same problem - what to say to a friend whose play or performance we hated. Over the years, a few solutions have worked:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll never be better . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was a play . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no words . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should have been out front . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve never seen anything like it . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People will remember this evening for a long time . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDream Wife would not be released to theaters for several months and I decided this was the perfect time to take Jorja on another European vacation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJorja was as excited about the trip as I was. We sat down and discussed where we would go. London, Paris, Rome . . . In the middle of our planning, there was a phone call. It was Ladislaus Bush-Fekete, calling from Munich. I had not heard from Laci since the closing of Alice in Arms, which was almost ten years earlier. Since that time, Kirk Douglas had become a major star. I was pleased that I had not destroyed his career.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sidney,\" Laci said, in his thick Hungarian accent, \"how are you? Marika and I miss you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re fine, Laci. I miss you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When are you coming to Europe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As a matter of fact, we\u0027re leaving next week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. You must come to Munich and visit us. Can you do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about it for a second. \"You bet we can. I want you to meet Jorja.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonderful. Let me know when you\u0027re coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hung up and told Jorja, \"That was Ladislaus Bush-Fekete.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJorja looked at me. \"Alice in Arms,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. \"You\u0027ll like him, and his wife is lovely. And Munich is beautiful. We\u0027ll have a great time there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight before we left, Sam Spiegel called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam Spiegel was one of Hollywood\u0027s most colorful characters. Born in Austria, he had come to Hollywood to sell Egyptian cotton. He had served time in Brixton Prison for fraud. While in Hollywood, he decided to become a producer, and changed his name to S. P. Eagle. He became the joke of the town. When Darryl Zanuck heard the news, he said, \"I\u0027m changing my name to Z. A. Nuck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe laughter quickly stopped, for Sam Spiegel went on to produce a long list of Academy Award-winning pictures, including Lawrence of Arabia, On the Waterfront, and The African Queen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had met him at one of the lavish parties he gave, and we had become friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter his phone call, Jorja and I had dinner with Sam. He said, \"I\u0027ve heard about a foreign film I might be interested in remaking. If you\u0027re going to Paris, I\u0027d appreciate it if you\u0027d take a look at it and tell me what you think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree days later, Jorja and I flew to New York, to spend a few days before boarding the Queen Mary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were some interesting plays on Broadway - The Crucible, Wonderful Town, Picnic, The Seven Year Itch, and Dial M for Murder. Walking into the lobbies of the various theaters gave me a sharp sense of deja vu. Some of the plays were in theaters that Ben Roberts and I had had plays in. So many incredible events had happened since that time. But the most incredible of all was that a Cary Grant picture that I had directed was going to open at Radio City Music Hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne evening, Jorja and I went to see The Crucible, Arthur Miller\u0027s new play. In the cast were Arthur Kennedy, E. G. Marshall, Beatrice Straight, and Madeleine Sherwood. It was a stunning evening in the theater. Jorja was enthralled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the curtain came down, she turned to me. \"Who directed this play?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jed Harris. He\u0027s directed Uncle Vanya, A Doll\u0027s House, Our Town, and The Heiress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s incredible,\" Jorja declared. \"I want to work with him one day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took her hand. \"Only if he\u0027s that lucky.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-other-side-of-me/page-23.html","bookId":2371,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:27 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:27 AM"}
