Or maybe insanity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInsanity? Well, this kept getting better and better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re talking about Adam?\" She cut me a quick, sharp glance and I shrugged. \"I read some before I came here. He was in the army. Flipped out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So they say.\" Her lips went prim. \"But I wasn\u0027t referring to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI resisted the urge to shake her until all the secrets spilled out. Mrs. Beasly was the type of woman who wouldn\u0027t talk if you pissed her off - kind of like me. I\u0027d bet my next hot shower that the info she would impart couldn\u0027t be found in any book. Instead, I held my breath and I waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter another glance around the echoing, cavernous library, she lowered her voice until I practically had to crawl over the desk to hear her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suicide.\" The word seemed to slither across my neck like Lazarus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Both Adam\u0027s father and his grandfather.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. No wonder Adam had escaped to the army.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The police were certain it was suicide?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They both...\" She paused, uncomfortable. \"Well, there\u0027s really no other way to say this except straight out They blew their heads off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Both of them.?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"There was an investigation. But the angle of the gun pretty much told the tale. The sons were always suspect, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sons?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adam\u0027s father was a suspect for his father\u0027s death, and Adam for his.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The police thought there was money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there wasn\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not only are the Ruelles cursed with insanity and sons, but everything they touch...\" She spread her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Turns to shit,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth pruned again. \"If you must be vulgar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027They\u0027re land-poor,\" she said. \"The mansion, the swamp. Keeping that in the family takes a lot of money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is there a mansion near the swamp anyway?\" I asked. That had always bugged me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The first Ruelle came to Louisiana from France by way of Canada.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcadian. I thought so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those people, the Cajuns, they kept to themselves, but the Ruelles even more so. They bought that land for a song, and they refused through centuries of bad luck to let it pass out of the family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never understood the obsession with land, but wars had been fought, countless lives had been lost, over just that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was there any indication of why the senior Ruelles killed themselves?\" I continued. \"A note?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to read the articles on those deaths, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at my watch. First I needed to pick up my film.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll find them for you,\" Mrs. Beasly said. I can make copies. A dollar a sheet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be great.\" I handed her ten dollars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ll leave them at the desk. If I\u0027m not here, someone will be. What\u0027s your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Diana Malone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave me her English teacher stare. \"I\u0027ve never heard of the Ruelles having Irish relatives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wrong side of the blanket,\" I said. \"Hush-hush.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor an instant I thought she might refuse to help me, and why? She was a librarian, paid to impart information. What difference did it make who I was?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess not much, because she pocketed the money and said good-bye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hurried outside, surprised at what I\u0027d learned. However, the real surprise awaited me at the photo shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paid for the prints, anxiously drew them from the envelope, men nabbed the clerk and shoved one under his nose. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince he was about ten years younger, four inches shorter, and twenty pounds lighter than me, he got that deer in the headlights look as his prominent Adam\u0027s apple began to bob. \"I... uh... what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \" He peered at the picture. \"There is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t mean the swamp, the grass, the trees. There was something there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know!\" I practically shouted. \"That\u0027s why I took the picture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid appeared more confused than ever. \"You took a photo of something, and it isn\u0027t on the print?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s impossible, ma\u0027am. If there was something there, it\u0027d be,\" he pointed to the lovely picture of nighttime in the swamp, \"there. Unless it was a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorted at his own wit \"No, wait, that\u0027s a mirror. Vampires don\u0027t have a reflection. It\u0027s werewolves that don\u0027t show up on a photograph.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned, blaming the shiver that passed over me on too much air-conditioning for a steamy autumn day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy voice must have alerted the kid to the fact that I was not amused, because he stopped snickering and retreated behind the counter. Like that would keep me from following him if I wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Werewolves don\u0027t show up on film,\" he repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you know this why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve lived in New Orleans all my life,\" he answered, as if that explained everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no such thing as vampires or werewolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No?\" he murmured, the word taking on a faint French twist. \u0027\u0027Maybe you should spend some time alone in the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuarter after midnight. Or walk through the swamp under a full moon. You know why there are no cemetery tours after dusk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People get robbed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure they do. And the dead also rise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the young man who\u0027d seemed so harmless, almost shy. Now he just seemed nuts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ooookay.\" I backed toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The only way to tell if a wolf is a werewolf is to shoot it with silver.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Makes sense,\" I said. \"Thanks for the tip.\" Was this guy for real?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fumbled with the door, got it open, and fled into the heat\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not going back there,\" I muttered. Even if they hadn\u0027t screwed up my pictures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only a coincidence that my photos showed nothing but grass, and werewolves didn\u0027t show up in a photo. Because there was no such thing, no such thing, no such thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd maybe if I clicked my heels together three times I\u0027d be in Kansas and not in the middle of this mess. I was tempted to try, but I was fresh out of ruby slippers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead I bought new film, telling myself the airport X-ray machines had ruined mine, then headed for the swamp. Not until I\u0027d parked in front of the mansion did I remember the articles I was supposed to pick up at the library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rumble of thunder in the distance turned my gaze to the west. Huge, dark clouds billowed on the horizon. Looked like we were in for a doozy of a storm. Since I was used to wussy Midwestern thunderstorms, rather than Southern hurricane-force winds, tomorrow seemed as good a time as any to return to town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, if I dug out some soap, I could take a shower right in the front yard. Considering the heat index of the last couple days, the idea had too much merit to pass up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI locked my camera and photos in the trunk with the gun, then hurried inside and grabbed what I needed, along with my gris-gris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When in Rome,\" I murmured as I shoved it into the pocket of my pants. I left the zombie-revealing powder behind, afraid the stuff would disintegrate, or worse, if wet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sky opened up when I stepped onto the porch. Though the rain was warm, steam rose when the drops hit the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dragged off my jeans, socks, shoes, and through an acrobatic maneuver managed to slide my bra from beneath my tank top. Then I walked into the storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was drenched in an instant, my top and underwear plastered against me like a size 4 Lycra bodysuit. Quickly I made use of the soap and the shampoo. Needles of rain washed everything away; rivulets of water ran down my face so fast, I could barely see. When I was done, I continued to stand under the clouds, lifting my hands to the sky as I let nature cleanse me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeesse de la lune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes snapped open. Slowly I turned a circle in the yard. Why did I keep hearing those words murmured in French as if they were the whisper on the wind? Was I losing my mind?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned at the Ruelle Mansion. Did everyone who lived in that place eventually eat lead?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRefusing to be spooked, I stalked to the porch, rubbed the towel over my body, and stepped into my jeans. I lifted my head, glanced toward the swamp, and saw someone watching me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rain beat down; the mist drifted up. I had a hard time focusing, but there was definitely a person, a man, leaning against a cypress tree about a hundred yards from the house. Spanish moss hung from the branches, nearly touching the ground, obscuring his face. But the outline of the body was familiar, as were the hair, the jeans, the bare chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adam?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sick of this,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was going to confront him, ask all my questions, and demand answers. Tossing the towel on the porch, I headed into the storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe figure didn\u0027t move as I approached. He seemed wilder somehow - his eyes brighter, his hair more tangled, his body tense as a stalking beast Without the shirt, skin slick with rain, I could see every ridge, every curve. He wasn\u0027t wearing his bracelet. I couldn\u0027t remember ever seeing him without it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy was he here? Did he want the same thing that I did? Mindless sex until I couldn\u0027t remember the questions anymore?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached the edge of the yard, the cusp of the swamp, and still he waited. Lightning flashed; water ran into my eyes. Impatiently I swiped at my face, and when I looked again, he was gone. Had I seen him or only wished that I had?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd why would I wish? The police wanted to talk to Adam Ruelle about strangling the life out of someone. I shouldn\u0027t go near the man, let alone lust after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough he disturbed me hi ways I didn\u0027t want to examine, had scared me more times than I wanted to count, I couldn\u0027t wrap my mind around the idea that Adam had killed someone with his bare hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d felt those hands on me, and while they\u0027d been desperate, urgent, and rough, they hadn\u0027t been violent However, that didn\u0027t mean they couldn\u0027t be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath the tree I found the slight indentation of a bare foot in the dirt Then another and another, leading deeper into the swamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t crazy. He had been here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should turn back; I might get lost and wander for days. But I followed the tracks anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy I was so obsessed I had no idea. The man was a mystery, and I liked my life neat. Perhaps that explained my difficulty believing in the paranormal. The paranormal didn\u0027t make sense, hence the name. I hated things that did not make sense. I was obliged to make sense of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a half an hour of traveling at a pretty fast clip, the trail petered out. I paused, ears straining, eyes searching. All I saw was the swamp in the rain; all I heard was that rain coming down. Then I smelled the faint, acrid scent of a cigarette.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I blinked the water out of my eyes, my gaze was caught by what appeared to be a roof on the other side of a slight rise. I had no choice but to head in that direction, even when my bare feet sank to the ankles in muck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled them out, wincing at the disgusting sucking sound they made popping free of the greenish-brown goo. Luckily, once I hit solid ground, the rain washed away the slime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI topped the hill and stared at the shack, which seemed to have sprouted from a bayou. The building resembled something straight out of The Beverly Hillbillies III: Elly May Does Louisiana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good title for a porn flick,\" I murmured, peering at the figure on the porch, one that could put pornographic thoughts into the mind of any woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shirtless Adam Ruelle leaned against the railing, smoking as he watched the storm rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the swamp, suddenly tempted to go back, A flicker of movement somewhere in the depths had me hurrying into the slight valley, stopping at the edge of the overgrown front yard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant I appeared, Adam\u0027s attention fell from the sky to me. He took one last draw on his cigarette, then flicked the thing into the grass, where it hissed as the ember met rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked slowly down the steps and across the ground, stopping so close, the heat of his body battled the chill of mine. I half-expected steam to rise from my soaked clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze wandered over me; desire rolled across his face like thunder rolls across the sky. His eyes locked on my breasts, and I glanced down, my face heating at the sight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d removed my bra, spent nearly an hour in the rain. Being topless would be less suggestive than wearing the soaked tank, which outlined the weight and fullness, seeming to accent the thrust of my nipples, magnifying the darkness of the areola.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached out, the tanned skin of his hand stark against the white shirt as he cupped one breast gently, almost reverently. Testing the weight, he skimmed a single thumb over the tip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth to ask... something, and he yanked me against him. My breath caught, the sound both fear and excitement. I tilted my head, an offering, and his lips captured mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur tongues met; his tasted of smoke and I liked it, which only showed how far gone I was. I\u0027d never cared for cigarettes, but when Adam smoked them, I could only think of how I\u0027d feel if he wrapped his beautiful lips around my nipple the way he wrapped them around a cigarette and suckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arousal rubbed against me. My hands flitted over his skin, kneading the muscles, learning the curves and the dips. I couldn\u0027t think, could only feel both his desperation and my own. I should have protested, pulled away, but I didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the moment I\u0027d first seen him we\u0027d been headed for this. I could no more have stopped what was about to happen than I could have stopped the moon from growing larger with each passing night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted his head, glanced into the trees, frowned. I tangled my fingers in his hair; then I frowned, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d been out in the rain as long as I had, yet his hair was almost dry. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-crescent-moon-nightcreature-4/page-13.html","bookId":2091,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:32 PM"}
