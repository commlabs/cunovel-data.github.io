{"id":36719,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXVI","content":"It was late in September, when she asked Arthur Weston to tell her how she could help \"those awful women,\"—as she called the poor creatures she had seen in jail. He had motored out to Lakeville for a cup of tea, and while they waited for the kettle to boil, they wandered off along the shore of the lake, and found a little inlet walled with willows, where they could sit on the beach and see nothing but the wrinkling flash of waves and a serene stretch of sky. They sat there, talking idly, and watching the willow leaves turn all their silvery backs to a hesitating breeze.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Weston listened silently to her plans for \"getting busy\" with prison reform—when she suddenly broke off:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t see that the vote will do much.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He gave her an astonished look. \"What! This from you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She nodded. \"Of course I\u0027m for suffrage, first, last, and all the time! But I\u0027m sort of discouraged about what we can accomplish. Life is so big.\" The old cocksureness was gone. The pathos of common sense in Freddy made him wince. \"But I\u0027ve got to do something,\" she ended. \"Miss Eliza told me I was selfish.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 281]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Look here! I won\u0027t let Cousin Eliza call you names! I reserve that for myself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She laughed. \"You\u0027ve done it, often enough.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Arthur Weston tickled the sleeping Zip and whistled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What do you suppose Laura told me the other day?\" Fred said. \"She said that \u0027no woman really knew what life meant unless she had a baby.\u0027 She said having a baby was like coming out of prison—because \u0027self\u0027 is a prison. Rather tall talk for little Laura, wasn\u0027t it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Any of the great human experiences are keys to our prison-house,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"True enough,\" she agreed; then, abruptly, her own great experience spoke: \"Isn\u0027t it queer? I rather dislike Howard.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s unreasonable. He\u0027s the same old Howard—a mighty decent chap.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He\u0027s not—what I supposed he was.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, that\u0027s your fault, not his. You dressed him up in your ideas; when he got into his own clothes, you didn\u0027t like him. Howard never pretended to be anything he wasn\u0027t.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes! Yes, he did!\" she said, with sudden agitation. \"He used to—listen to me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good heavens, don\u0027t hold that up against him! Don\u0027t I listen to you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, but you never let me think you agree with me! I always know you don\u0027t.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He agrees far more than I do.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No,\" she said, with a somber look. \"He just let me talk. He didn\u0027t care. The things that were real to me[Pg 282] weren\u0027t real to him. His real things were—what\u0027s happening now. The baby, and Laura. Is it so with all of you? Don\u0027t you ever care with your minds?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He stopped tickling Zip, and looked out over the lake with narrowing eyes; after a while he said, gently:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think the caring with the mind comes second. When a man falls in love, the mind has nothing to do with it. Sometimes it reinforces the heart, so to speak; when that happens, you have the perfect marriage—which isn\u0027t awfully common. It\u0027s apt to be just the heart; which gets pretty dull after a while. But just the head is arid.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He would have found just my head,—arid?\" she pondered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He looked straight at her, and said, quietly: \"I think he would.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was a long pause.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Was it head, or heart, with you?\" she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s both,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She gave him a puzzled look: \"Why, you don\u0027t mean that you care for that horrid Kate, still?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He smiled, and looked off over the water.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are very stupid, Fred.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She was plainly perplexed. \"I don\u0027t understand?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s why I say you are stupid.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His face was turned away from her; he was breaking a dead twig into inch-long pieces, and carefully arranging them in a precise fagot on his knee; she saw, with a little shock of surprise, that his fingers were trembling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why, Arthur!\" she began,—and stopped short, the color rising slowly to her forehead. He gave her a quick look.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 283]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why!\" she said again, faintly, \"you don\u0027t mean—? you\u0027re not—?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He laughed, opening his hands in a gesture of amused and hopeless assent. \"I am,\" he said, and flung the tiny fagot out on the water.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fred dropped her chin on her fists and watched the twigs dancing off over the waves. They were both silent; then she said, frowning, and pausing a little between her words as if trying to take in their full meaning:—\"You are in love with me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Has it just struck you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How could it strike me—that you would care for a girl like me!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Considering your intelligence, you are astonishingly obtuse, at times. I couldn\u0027t care for any other kind of girl. Or for any girl, except you!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Miss Eliza said something that made me wonder if.... But I couldn\u0027t believe it. I thought that sort of thing was over for you. I never dreamed of—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, well! don\u0027t dream of it now. Of course it doesn\u0027t make a particle of difference. I didn\u0027t mean to speak of it; it sort of broke loose,\" he ended, in rueful confession.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fred was silent.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Arthur Weston, hiding the tremor that was tingling all through him, began to talk easily, of anything—Zip, the weather, whether Miss Carter could be induced to reconsider her annual resignation; \"It would be very hard on Mrs. Payton to lose her,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well,\" Frederica said, slowly, \"I don\u0027t see any reason why I shouldn\u0027t marry you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 284]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He caught his breath; then struck his hand on hers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re a good sport! I take back my accusation that you weren\u0027t. I could name several reasons why you shouldn\u0027t marry me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Name them.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Fred, look here; this is a serious business with me. I can\u0027t talk about it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I want to talk about it. I\u0027d like to know your reasons.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To begin with—age.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She nodded. \"In years you are older. But I\u0027m not young any more.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The water stung in his eyes; she was right—she was not \"young\" now. \"The next reason,\" he went on, without looking at her, \"is that you are not in love with me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She thought that over: \"But I am fond of you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That won\u0027t do for marriage.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s more than just fondness with you?\" she asked, doubtfully.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He caught her hand, kissed it, and flung it from him. \"Come!\" he said, harshly, \"let\u0027s go home!\" He rose, but she did not move.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you love me?\" she insisted, looking up at him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was silent. When he spoke his voice was rough with suffering. \"I love you as much ... as I can. But it\u0027s not worth the taking. I know that. I wouldn\u0027t ask you to take it. You ought to have—fire and gold! I spent my gold ten years ago; and the fire burned itself out. Don\u0027t talk about it. I feel like lead, sometimes, compared with you. But I\u0027m not adamant.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She got on her feet, and stood looking out over the[Pg 285] lake. For a long while neither of them spoke. Then she said: \"Arthur, I\u0027m not in love with anybody else. I can\u0027t imagine, now, how I ever thought I was!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You will be in love with somebody else one of these days.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She shook her head. \"No; that\u0027s all over. There is no fire and gold in me, either. Something—was killed, I think.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It will come to life.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She gave a little gasp: \"No. It\u0027s dead. But what is left is—well, it isn\u0027t bad, what\u0027s left. Sometimes,\" she said, with sudden sweet gaiety, \"sometimes I think it\u0027s better than what Howard and Laura have!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, it isn\u0027t,\" he said, sadly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wonder,\" she pondered, \"if I could have been ... like Laura? She hasn\u0027t a thought except for the baby and Howard. They are the center of Life to her;—which is all right, I suppose. But they are its circumference, too; which seems to me dreadfully cramping. I never could be like that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He smiled, in spite of himself. \"Nature is a pretty big thing, Fred; when you hold your own child in your arms—\" he stopped short. \"Life is bigger than theories,\" he said, in a low voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She nodded: \"I know what you mean. But I never could be a fool, Arthur.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think,\" he said, and again something in his voice made her catch her breath; \"I think you could be,—at moments.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Better not count on it,\" she said; \"but if you want[Pg 286] me, in spite of my \u0027arid\u0027 head,—you can take me! Of course, just for a minute, when I wrung it from you that you—cared, I was rather stunned, because I didn\u0027t believe Miss Eliza knew. But on the whole, I think—I\u0027d like it.\" She smiled at him, and her eyes brimmed with affection. \"You see, we\u0027re friends; and you never bore me. Howard would have bored me awfully. So—I will marry you, Arthur.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was silent. \"Rather hard,\" she said, mischievously, \"to have to offer myself tw—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Stop!\" he said; \"don\u0027t say things like that!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, then—\" she began; but he lifted a silencing hand:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My dear, my dear, I love you too much to marry you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why, then,\" she said, simply, \"you love me, it seems to me, enough to marry me. Don\u0027t you see?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He looked at her with hungry eyes. \"I think I am man enough to save you from myself,\" he said; \"but don\u0027t—don\u0027t tempt me too far!\"...\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1821/52875.html","bookId":1026,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 7:23:17 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 7:23:17 AM"}
