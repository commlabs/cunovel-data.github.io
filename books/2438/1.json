It wasn\u0027t a very long walk - less than a mile - and though the night was dark, he knew every step of the way as surely as he knew how to tie a reef knot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanley was a scoutmaster. He loved the Scouts. He\u0027d been one when he was a boy and kept in contact when he grew up. He\u0027d turned his own three sons into first-rate Scouts, and now that they\u0027d grown up and left home, he was helping the local kids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanley walked quickly to keep warm. He was only wearing shorts and a T-shirt, and even though it was a nice night, his arms and legs were soon covered in goosebumps. He didn\u0027t mind. His wife would have a delicious cup of hot chocolate and cookies waiting for him when he got home. He\u0027d enjoy them all the more after a good, brisk walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrees grew along both sides of the road home, making it very dark and dangerous for anyone who wasn\u0027t used to it. But Stanley had no fears. On the contrary, he loved the night. He enjoyed listening to the sound of his feet crunching through the grass and briars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrunch. Crunch. Crunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. When his sons were young, he\u0027d often pretended there were monsters lying in wait up in the trees as they walked home. He\u0027d make scary noises and shake the leaves of low-hanging branches when the boys weren\u0027t looking. Sometimes they\u0027d burst into screams and run for home at top speed, and Stanley would follow after them, laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrunch. Crunch. Crunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, if he was having trouble getting to sleep at night, he would imagine the sounds of his feet as they made their way home, and that always helped him drift off into a happy dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrunch. Crunch. Crunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the nicest sound in the world, as far as Stanley was concerned. It was a great feeling, to know you were all alone and safe as can be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrunch. Crunch. Crunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanley stopped and frowned. That had sounded like a stick breaking - but how could it have been? He would have felt it if he\u0027d stepped on a twig. And there were no cows or sheep in the nearby fields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood still for about half a minute, listening curiously. When there were no more sounds, he shook his head and smiled. It had been his imagination playing tricks on him, that was all. He\u0027d tell the wife about it when he got home and they\u0027d have a good old laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started walking again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrunch. Crunch. Crunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere. Back to the familiar sounds. There was nobody else around. He would have heard more than a single branch snapping if there was. Nobody could creep up on Stanley J. Collins. He was a trained scoutmaster. His ears were as sharp as a fox\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrunch. Crunch. Crunch. Crunch. Cru -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanley stopped again and, for the first time, the fingers of fear began to squeeze around his beating heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat hadn\u0027t been his imagination. He\u0027d heard it, clear as a bell. A twig snapping, somewhere overhead. And before it snapped - had there been the slightest rustling sound, like something moving?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanley gazed up at the trees but it was too dark to see. There could have been a monster the size of a car up there and he wouldn\u0027t have been able to spot it. Ten monsters! A hundred! A thou-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, that was silly. There were no monsters in the trees. Monsters didn\u0027t exist. Everyone knew that. Monsters weren\u0027t real. It was a squirrel or an owl up there, something ordinary like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanley raised a foot and began to bring it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis foot hung in the air, midstep, and his heart pounded quickly. That was no squirrel! The sound was too sharp. Something big was up there. Something that shouldn\u0027t be up there. Something that had never been up there before. Something that -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnap!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound was closer this time, lower down, and suddenly Stanley could stand it no longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began to run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanley was a large man, but pretty fit for his age. Still, it had been a long time since he\u0027d run this fast, and after a hundred yards he was out of breath and had a cramp in his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slowed to a halt and bent over, gasping for air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head shot up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrunch. Crunch. Crunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were footsteps coming toward him! Slow, heavy footsteps. Stanley listened, terrified, as they came closer and closer. Had the monster leaped ahead of him through the trees? Had it climbed down? Was it coming to finish him off? Was it...?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrunch. Crunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe footsteps stopped and Stanley was able to make out a figure in the darkness. It was smaller than he\u0027d expected, no bigger than a boy. He took a deep breath, straightened up, got his courage up, and stepped forward for a better look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only a boy! A small, frightened-looking boy, dressed in a dirty suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanley smiled and shook his head. What a fool he\u0027d been! The wife would have a field day when he told her about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay, son?\"Stanley asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanley didn\u0027t recognize the youngster, but there were a lot of new families around these days. He no longer knew every child in the neighborhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I help you?\"he asked. \"Are you lost?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy shook his head slowly. There was something strange about him. Something that suddenly made Stanley feel uneasy. It might have been the effect of the darkness and the shadows...but the boy looked very pale, very thin, very...hungry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\"Stanley asked again, stepping closer. \"Can I-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnap!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound came from directly overhead, loud and menacing. The boy leaped back quickly, out of the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanley just had time to glance up and see a huge red shape, which might have been some sort of bat, falling through the branches of the trees, almost faster than his eyes could follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the red thing was on him. Stanley opened his mouth to scream, but before he could, the monster\u0027s hands - claws? - clamped over his mouth. There was a brief struggle, then Stanley was sliding onto the ground, unconscious, unseeing, unknowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbove him, the two creatures of the night moved in for the feed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-s-assistant-the-saga-of-darren-shan-2/page-1.html","bookId":2438,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:13:08 PM"}
