She bit his shoulder and whispered, \"Don\u0027t torment me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let out a low groan of pleasure and began to move, slowly at first, until she became more demanding. He was mindless to everything but her. He had never been this out of control before or this desperate to make her belong to him, even if it was for only one night. Sex had always been entertainment for him and a way to relieve tension, but with Alison it was so much more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt her tighten around him as she cried out his name. He found release at the same time, and damn, it nearly killed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy . . . ,\" she whispered\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sounded shell-shocked, and Liam smiled, gratified. He still couldn\u0027t move away from her, so he held her tight as he rolled onto his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison didn\u0027t move. She wanted to remember how this felt to be held by him and loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" he asked breathlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe panted her reply. \"Oh yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs much as she wanted to linger, she forced herself to roll away from him and get out of bed. She found her robe and put it on, threaded her fingers through her hair to give it some kind of order, and walked barefoot out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell? \"Where are you going?\" Liam asked. Did she already regret what had just happened? He hoped not. He sure as certain didn\u0027t. He\u0027d wanted her from the minute she opened the door tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To fix the printer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam was floored. This was a first for him. He was typically the one who would ease his way out without hurting feelings. There was always the time after sex when the woman he was with wanted affirmation that it had been wonderful for him, even though it usually wasn\u0027t. It wasn\u0027t bad, either. It was just sex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil Allison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBewildered by what he was feeling, he decided he wasn\u0027t going to waste another minute thinking about it. Taking her lead, he got dressed. When he joined her, she was printing the second copy of the contract. Liam once again read it over, and only when he was sure everything was the way he wanted did he offer her a pen. She signed it and handed it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Phillips is going to have a fit when he reads this,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam smiled. \"Yes, he will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess this is it, then,\" she said. \"And you\u0027re off to London.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his suit jacket on and walked to the door. \"Okay, then. You\u0027re going to be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both put their hands on the doorknob at the same time. Allison let go and stepped back. He turned to say good-bye, changed his mind, and pulled her into his arms. He kissed her long and hard and walked out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was gone. It took another hour for Allison to admit the truth. She felt abandoned. That didn\u0027t make any sense to her, but then, having sex with Liam and pretending it hadn\u0027t meant anything didn\u0027t make any sense, either. Didn\u0027t he know? Didn\u0027t he have a glimmer of a notion that he was more than a casual fling to her? Apparently not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe really couldn\u0027t blame him, because she had only just figured it out. Trying to be a with-it modern woman wasn\u0027t working for her. She had no one to blame but herself. She should have known she wasn\u0027t cut out for games. She didn\u0027t have the nerves or the disposition to be coy or clever. No wonder she hid in her computer. It couldn\u0027t hurt her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEIGHTEEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEight weeks, three days, and not a word from Liam. Not that she cared, because she didn\u0027t. Swamped with work and classes, she had barely thought about him. She accepted the fact that he had moved on, just as she had. She told herself that lie so many times she was almost beginning to believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExams were finally over. She turned in the last paper she was ever going to write for persnickety Dr. Bracey\u0027s class, and she was officially finished. Now that she thought about it, senior year hadn\u0027t been all that difficult, just time-consuming.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer job, on the other hand, was making her crazy. She was getting sick and tired of being dragged out of her apartment by the FBI. There were always two agents-never one or three-banging at her door at the most inconvenient times. Every once in a while, if they were in a \"let\u0027s prank the employee\" mood, one of them would dangle handcuffs in front of her face to get her to hurry. They thought it was funny, but their little stunt wasn\u0027t humorous in Starbucks or the gym. Their ferocious expressions could scare the bejesus out of an ordinary person. The scare tactics were wasted on her. The agents were having fun, she supposed, and fun was hard to come by in their line of work, so she let them torment her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer days at the cyber unit were intense. Because Phillips assigned her only the most complex cases, he kept her isolated in her own office. The other employees passing by looked through the glass wall and saw her working. When she glanced their way, they returned her smile, and when she passed them in the hall, they nodded and said hello, but there was no other interaction or camaraderie. She didn\u0027t take time to form relationships with coworkers. They most likely assumed she was antisocial. To them she looked as though she had it all together because she had had years of practice perfecting her laid-back attitude. On the outside she appeared to be calm, cool, and in control, but on the inside she was a mess of nerves, and she was mentally counting the days until she would once again be free to pursue her own dreams. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-71.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
