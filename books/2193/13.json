Not that I mind, necessarily, since I would be glad for you two to sever your association. But if this is the pattern you follow in your romantic attachments, I want to know now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of several things to say, discarded the first few, which would have blistered my grandmother\u0027s ears, and drew a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Firstly, Eric, what happens between Bill and me is just none of your damn business.\" I let that sink in for a few seconds. \"Second, my relationship with Bill is the only one I\u0027ve ever had, so I\u0027ve never had any idea what I\u0027m going to do even from day to day, much less establishing a policy.\" I paused to work on phrasing my next idea. \"Third, I\u0027m through with you all. I\u0027m tired of seeing all this sick stuff. I\u0027m tired of having to be brave, and having to do things that scare me, and having to hang out with the bizarre and the supernatural. I am just a regular person, and I just want to date regular people. Or at least people who are breathing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric waited to see if I\u0027d finished. I cast a quick glance over at him, and the streetlights illuminated his strong profile with its knife-edge nose. At least he wasn\u0027t laughing at me. He wasn\u0027t even smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at me briefly before turning his attention back to the road. \"I\u0027m listening to what you say. I can tell you mean it. I\u0027ve had your blood: I know your feelings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA mile of darkness went by. I was pleased Eric was taking me seriously. Sometimes he didn\u0027t; and sometimes he didn\u0027t seem to care what he said to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are spoiled for humans,\" Eric said. His slight foreign accent was more apparent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe I am. Though I don\u0027t see that as much of a loss, since I didn\u0027t have any luck with guys before.\" Hard to date, when you know exactly what your date is thinking. So much of the time, knowing a man\u0027s exact thoughts can erase desire and even liking. \"But I\u0027d be happier with no one than I am now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d been considering the old Ann Landers rule of thumb: Would I be better off with him, or without him? My grandmother and Jason and I had read Ann Landers every day when Jason and I had been growing up. We\u0027d discussed all Ann\u0027s responses to reader questions. A lot of the advice she\u0027d ladled out had been intended to help women deal with guys like Jason, so he certainly brought perspective to the conversations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight at this moment, I was pretty darn sure I was better off without Bill. He\u0027d used me and abused me, betrayed me and drained me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d also defended me, avenged me, worshiped me with his body, and provided hours of uncritical companionship, a very major blessing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, I just didn\u0027t have my scales handy. What I had was a heart full of hurt and a way to go home. We flew through the black night, wrapped in our own thoughts. Traffic was light, but this was an interstate, so of course there were cars around us from time to time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no idea what Eric was thinking about, a wonderful feeling. He might be debating pulling over to the shoulder and breaking my neck, or he might be wondering what tonight\u0027s take at Fangtasia would add up to. I wanted him to talk to me. I wished he would tell me about his life before he became a vampire, but that\u0027s a real touchy subject with lots of vamps, and I wasn\u0027t about to bring it up tonight of all nights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout an hour out of Bon Temps, we took an exit ramp. We were a little low on gas, and I needed to use the ladies\u0027 room. Eric had already begun to fill the tank as I eased my sore body carefully out of the car. He had dismissed my offer to pump the gas with a courteous, \"No, thank you.\" One other car was filling up, and the woman, a peroxide blond about my age, hung up the nozzle as I got out of the Lincoln.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt one in the morning, the gas station/convenience store was almost empty besides the young woman, who was heavily made up and wrapped in a quilted coat. I spied a battered Toyota pickup parked by the side of the filling station, in the only shadow on the lot. Inside the pickup, two men were sitting, involved in a heated conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s too cold to be sitting outside in a pickup,\" the dark-rooted blond said, as we went through the glass doors together. She gave an elaborate shiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d think so,\" I commented. I was halfway down the aisle by the back of the store, when the clerk, behind a high counter on a raised platform, turned away from his little television to take the blond\u0027s money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door to the bathroom was hard to shut behind me, since the wooden sill had swollen during some past leakage. In fact, it probably didn\u0027t shut all the way behind me, since I was in something of a hurry. But the stall door shut and locked, and it was clean enough. In no hurry to get back in the car with the silent Eric, I took my time after using the facilities. I peered in the mirror over the sink, expecting I\u0027d look like holy hell and not being contradicted by what I saw reflected there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mangled bite mark on my neck looked really disgusting, as though a dog had had hold of me. As I cleaned the wound with soap and wet paper towels, I wondered if having ingested vampire blood would give me a specific quantity of extra strength and healing, and then be exhausted, or if it was good for a certain amount of time like a time-release capsule, or what the deal was. After I\u0027d had Bill\u0027s blood, I\u0027d felt great for a couple of months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t have a comb or brush or anything, and I looked like something the cat dragged in. Trying to tame my hair with my fingers just made a bad thing worse. I washed my face and neck, and stepped back into the glare of the store. I hardly registered that once again the door didn\u0027t shut behind me, instead lodged quietly on the swollen sill. I emerged behind the last long aisle of groceries, crowded with CornNuts and Lays Chips and Moon Pies and Scotch Snuf and Prince Albert in a can ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd two armed robbers up by the clerk\u0027s platform inside the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly Moses, why don\u0027t they just give these poor clerks shirts with big targets printed on them? That was my first thought, detached, as if I were watching a movie with a convenience store robbery. Then I snapped into the here and now, tuned in by the very real strain on the clerk\u0027s face. He was awfully young - a reedy, blotched teenager. And he was facing the two big guys with guns. His hands were in the air, and he was mad as hell. I would have expected blubbering for his life, or incoherence, but this boy was furious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the fourth time he\u0027d been robbed, I read fresh from his brain. And the third time at gunpoint. He was wishing he could grab the shotgun under the seat in his truck behind the store and blast these sumbitches to hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd no one acknowledged that I was there. They didn\u0027t seem to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that I was complaining, okay?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced behind me, to verify that the door to the bathroom had stuck open again, so its sound would not betray me. The best thing for me to do would be to creep out the back door to this place, if I could find it, and run around the building to get Eric to call the police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait a minute. Now that I was thinking of Eric, where was he? Why hadn\u0027t he come in to pay for the gas?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it was possible to have a foreboding any more ominous than the one I already had, that fit the bill. If Eric hadn\u0027t come in yet, Eric wasn\u0027t coming. Maybe he\u0027d decided to leave. Leave me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like Bill left you, my mind supplied helpfully. Well, thanks a hell of a lot, Mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr maybe they\u0027d shot him. If he\u0027d taken a head wound ... and there was no healing a heart that had taken a direct hit with a big-caliber bullet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no point whatsoever in standing there worrying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a typical convenience store. You came in the front door, and the clerk was behind a long counter to your right, up on a platform. The cold drinks were in the refrigerator case that took up the left wall. You were facing three long aisles running the width of the store, plus various special displays and stacks of insulated mugs and charcoal briquettes and birdseed. I was all the way at the back of the store and I could see the clerk (easily) and the crooks (just barely) over the top of the groceries. I had to get out of the store, preferably unseen. I spotted a splintered wooden door, marked \"Employees Only\" farther along the back wall. It was actually beyond the counter behind which the clerk stood. There was a gap between the end of the counter and the wall, and from the end of my aisle to the beginning of that counter, I\u0027d be exposed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing would be gained by waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dropped to my hands and knees and began crawling. I moved slowly, so I could listen, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You seen a blond come in here, about this tall?\" the burlier of the two robbers was saying, and all of a sudden I felt faint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich blond? Me, or Eric? Or the peroxide blond? Of course, I couldn\u0027t see the height indication. Were they looking for a male vampire or a female telepath? Or ... after all, I wasn\u0027t the only woman in the world who could get into trouble, I reminded myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blond woman come in here five minutes ago, bought some cigarettes,\" the boy said sullenly. Good for you, fella!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naw, that one done drove off. We want the one who was with the vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYep, that would be me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t see no other woman,\" the boy said. I glanced up a little and saw the reflection off a mirror mounted up in the corner of the store. It was a security mirror so the clerk could detect shoplifters. I thought, He can see me crouching here. He knows I\u0027m here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod bless him. He was doing his best for me. I had to do my best for him. At the same time, if we could avoid getting shot, that would be a very good thing. And where the hell was Eric?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlessing my borrowed sweatpants and slippers for being soft and silent, I crept deliberately toward the stained wooden \"Employees Only\" door. I wondered if it creaked. The two robbers were still talking to the clerk, but I blocked out their voices so I could concentrate on reaching the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d been scared before, plenty of times, but this was right up there with the scariest events of my life. My dad had hunted, and Jason and his buddies hunted, and I\u0027d watched a massacre in Dallas. I knew what bullets could do. Now that I\u0027d reached the end of the aisle, I\u0027d come to the end of my cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI peered around the display counter\u0027s end. I had to cross about four feet of open floor to reach the partial shelter of the long counter that ran in front of the cash register. I would be lower and well hidden from the robbers\u0027 perspective, once I crossed that empty space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Car pulling in,\" the clerk said, and the two robbers automatically looked out the plate glass window to see. If I hadn\u0027t known what he was doing telepathically, I might have hesitated too long. I scuttled across the exposed linoleum faster than I would have believed possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t see no car,\" said the less bulky man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clerk said, \"I thought I heard the bell ring, the one that goes when a car drives across it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached up and turned the knob on the door. It opened quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It rings sometimes when there ain\u0027t nobody there,\" the boy continued, and I realized he was trying to make noise and hold their attention so I could get out the door. God bless him, all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed the door a little wider, and duck-walked through. I was in a narrow passage. There was another door at the end of it, a door that presumably led to the area behind the convenience store. In the door was a set of keys. They wisely kept the back door locked. From one of a row of nails by the back door hung a heavy camo jacket. I poked my hand down in the pocket on the right and came up with the boy\u0027s keys. That was just a lucky guess. It happens. Clutching them to prevent their jingling, I opened the back door and stepped outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing out here but a battered pickup and a reeking Dumpster. The lighting was poor, but at least there was some light. The blacktop was cracked. Since it was winter, the weeds that had sprouted up from those cracks were dry and bleached. I heard a little sound to my left and drew in a shaky breath after I\u0027d jumped about a foot. The sound was caused by a huge old raccoon, and he ambled off into the small patch of woods behind the store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI exhaled just as shakily as I\u0027d drawn the air in. I made myself focus on the bunch of keys. Unfortunately, there were about twenty. This boy had more keys than squirrels had acorns. No one on God\u0027s green earth could possibly use this many keys. I flicked through them desperately, and finally selected one that had GM stamped on a black rubber cover. I unlocked the door and reached into the musty interior, which smelled strongly of cigarettes and dogs. Yes, the shotgun was under the seat. I broke it open. It was loaded. Thank God Jason believed in self-defense. He\u0027d showed me how to load and fire his new Benelli.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite my new protection, I was so scared, I wasn\u0027t sure I could get around to the front of the store. But I had to scout out the situation, and find out what had happened to Eric. I eased down the side of the building where the old Toyota truck was parked. Nothing was in the back, except a little spot that picked up a stray fraction of light. The shotgun cradled in one arm, I reached down to run a finger over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFresh blood. I felt old and cold. I stood with my head bowed for a long moment, and then I braced myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked in the driver\u0027s window to find the cab was unlocked. Well, happy days. I opened the door quietly, glanced in. There was a sizeable open box on the front seat, and when I checked its contents, my heart sank so low, I thought it\u0027d come out the bottom of my shoes. On the outside, the box was stamped \"Contents: Two.\" Now it contained one silver mesh net, the kind sold in \"mercenary\" magazines, the kind always advertised as \"vampire proof.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was like calling a shark cage a sure deterrent from shark bites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was Eric? I glanced over the immediate vicinity, but I saw no other trace. I could hear traffic whooshing by on the interstate, but the silence hung over this bleak parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes lit on a pocketknife on the dash. Yahoo! Carefully placing the shotgun on the front seat, I scooped up the knife, opened it after I\u0027d laid down the shotgun, and I held it ready to sink into the tire. Then I thought twice. A wholehearted tire-slashing was proof someone had been out here while the robbers were inside. That might not be a good thing. I contented myself with poking a single hole in the tire. It was just a smallish hole that might have come from anything, I told myself. If they did drive off, they\u0027d have to stop somewhere down the road. Then I pocketed the knife - I was certainly quite the thief lately - and returned to the shadows around the building. This hadn\u0027t taken as long as you might think, but still it had been several minutes since I\u0027d assessed the situation in the convenience store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lincoln was still parked by the pumps. The gas port was closed, so I knew Eric had finished refueling before something had happened to him. I sidled around the corner of the building, hugging its lines. I found good cover at the front, in the angle formed by the ice machine and the front wall of the store. I risked standing up enough to peek over the top of the machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe robbers had come up into the higher area where the clerk stood, and they were beating on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey, now. That had to stop. They were beating him because they wanted to know where I was hiding, was my guess; and I couldn\u0027t let someone else get beaten up on my behalf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sookie,\" said a voice right behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next instant a hand clapped across my mouth just as I was about to scream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" Eric whispered. \"I should have thought of a better way to let you know I was here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eric,\" I said, when I could speak. He could tell I was calmer, and he moved his hand. \"We gotta save him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes vampires just astound me. Well, people, too, but tonight it was a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he\u0027s getting beaten for our sakes, and they\u0027re probably gonna kill him, and it\u0027ll be our fault!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re robbing the store,\" Eric said, as if I were particularly dim. \"They had a new vampire net, and they thought they\u0027d try it out on me. They don\u0027t know it yet, but it didn\u0027t work. But they\u0027re just opportunistic scum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re looking for us,\" I said furiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me,\" he whispered, and I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me the shotgun,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept a good grip on it. \"You know how to use one of these things?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably as well as you.\" But he looked at it dubiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s where you\u0027re wrong,\" I told him. Rather than have a prolonged argument while my new hero was getting internal injuries, I ran in a crouch around the ice machine, the propane gas rack, and through the front door into the store. The little bell over the door rang like crazy, and though with all the shouting they didn\u0027t seem to hear it, they sure paid attention when I fired a blast through the ceiling over their heads. Tiles, dust, and insulation rained down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt almost knocked me flat - but not quite. I leveled the gun right on them. They were frozen. It was like playing Swing the Statue when I was little. But not quite. The poor pimply clerk had a bloody face, and I was sure his nose was broken, and some of his teeth knocked loose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a fine rage break out behind my eyes. \"Let the young man go,\" I said clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gonna shoot us, little lady?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bet your ass I am,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if she misses, I will get you,\" said Eric\u0027s voice, above and behind me. A big vampire makes great backup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The vampire got loose, Sonny.\" The speaker was a thinnish man with filthy hands and greasy boots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see that,\" said Sonny, the heavier one. He was darker, too. The smaller man\u0027s head was covered with that no-color hair, the kind people call \"brown\" because they have to call it something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young clerk pulled himself up out of his pain and fear and came around the counter as fast as he could move. Mixed with the blood on his face was a lot of white powder from me shooting into the ceiling. He looked a sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see you found my shotgun,\" he said as he passed by me, carefully not getting between the bad guys and me. He pulled a cell phone out of his pocket, and I heard the tiny beeps as he pressed numbers. His growly voice was soon in staccato conversation with the police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before the police get here, Sookie, we need to find out who sent these two imbeciles,\" Eric said. If I\u0027d been them, I\u0027d have been mighty scared at the tone of his voice, and they seemed to be aware of what an angry vampire could do. For the first time Eric stepped abreast of me and then a little bit ahead, and I could see his face. Burns crisscrossed it like angry strings of poison ivy welts. He was lucky only his face had been bare, but I doubt he was feeling very lucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come down here,\" Eric said, and he caught the eyes of Sonny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSonny immediately walked down from the clerk\u0027s platform and around the counter while his companion was gaping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay,\" said Eric. The no-color man squeezed his eyes shut so he couldn\u0027t glimpse Eric, but he opened them just a crack when he heard Eric take a step closer, and that was enough. If you don\u0027t have any extra abilities yourself, you just can\u0027t look a vampire in the eyes. If they want to, they\u0027ll get you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who sent you here?\" Eric asked softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of the Hounds of Hell,\" Sonny said, with no inflection in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric looked startled. \"A member of the motorcycle gang,\" I explained carefully, mindful that we had a civilian audience who was listening with great curiosity. I was getting a great amplification of the answers through their brains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did they tell you to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They told us to wait along the interstate. There are more fellas waiting at other gas stations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d called about forty thugs altogether. They\u0027d outlaid a lot of cash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were you supposed to watch for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A big dark guy and a tall blond guy. With a blond woman, real young, with nice tits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric\u0027s hand moved too fast for me to track. I was only sure he\u0027d moved when I saw the blood running down Sonny\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are speaking of my future lover. Be more respectful. Why were you looking for us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were supposed to catch you. Take you back to Jackson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The gang suspected you mighta had something to do with Jerry Falcon\u0027s disappearance. They wanted to ask you some questions about it. They had someone watching some apartment building, seen you two coming out in a Lincoln, had you followed part of the way. The dark guy wasn\u0027t with you, but the woman was the right one, so we started tracking you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do the vampires of Jackson know anything about this plan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, the gang figured it was their problem. But they also got a lot of other problems, a prisoner escape and so on, and lots of people out sick. So what with one thing and another, they recruited a bunch of us to help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are these men?\" Eric asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes and thought carefully. \"Nothing,\" I said. \"They\u0027re nothing.\" They weren\u0027t shifters, or Weres, or anything. They were hardly human beings, in my opinion, but nobody died and made me God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to get out of here,\" Eric said. I agreed heartily. The last thing I wanted to do was spend the night at the police station, and for Eric, that was an impossibility. There wasn\u0027t an approved vampire jail cell any closer than Shreveport. Heck, the police station in Bon Temps had just gotten wheelchair accessible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric looked into Sonny\u0027s eyes. \"We weren\u0027t here,\" he said. \"This lady and myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just the boy,\" Sonny agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, the other robber tried to keep his eyes tight shut, but Eric blew in his face, and just as a dog would, the man opened his eyes and tried to wiggle back. Eric had him in a second, and repeated his procedure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he turned to the clerk and handed him the shotgun. \"Yours, I believe,\" Eric said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" the boy said, his eyes firmly on the barrel of the gun. He aimed at the robbers. \"I know you weren\u0027t here,\" he growled, keeping his gaze ahead of him. \"And I ain\u0027t saying nothing to the police.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric put forty dollars on the counter. \"For the gas,\" he explained. \"Sookie, let\u0027s make tracks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A Lincoln with a big hole in the trunk does stand out,\" the boy called after us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s right.\" I was buckling up and Eric was accelerating as we heard sirens, pretty close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should have taken the truck,\" Eric said. He seemed pleased with our adventure, now that it was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s your face?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s getting better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe welts were not nearly as noticeable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" I asked, hoping this was not a very touchy subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cast me a sideways glance. Now that we were back on the interstate, we had slowed down to the speed limit, so it wouldn\u0027t seem to any of the many police cars converging on the convenience store that we were fleeing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"While you were tending to your human needs in the bathroom,\" he said, \"I finished putting gas in the tank. I had hung up the pump and was almost at the door when those two got out of the truck and just tossed a net over me. It is very humiliating, that they were able to do that, two fools with a silver net.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mind must have been somewhere else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said shortly. \"It was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So then what happened?\" I asked, when it seemed he was going to stop there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The heavier one hit me with the butt of his gun, and it took me a small time to recover,\" Eric said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw the blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touched a place on the back of his head. \"Yes, I bled. After getting used to the pain, I snagged a corner of the net on the bumper of their truck and managed to roll out of it. They were inept in that, as well as robbery. If they had tied the net shut with silver chains, the result might have been different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you got free?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The head blow was more of a problem than I thought at first,\" Eric said stiffly. \"I ran along the back of the store to the water spigot on the other side. Then I heard someone coming out of the back. When I was recovered, I followed the sounds and found you.\" After a long moment\u0027s silence, Eric asked me what had happened in the store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They got me confused with the other woman who went in the store at the same time I went to the ladies\u0027 room,\" I explained. \"They didn\u0027t seem to be sure I was in the store, and the clerk was telling them that there had been only one woman, and she\u0027d gone. I could tell he had a shotgun in his truck - you know, I heard it in his head - and I went and got it, and I disabled their truck, and I was looking for you because I figured something had happened to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you planned to save me and the clerk, together?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well ... yeah.\" I couldn\u0027t understand the odd tone of his voice. \"I didn\u0027t feel like I had a whole lot of choices there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe welts were just pink lines now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence still didn\u0027t seem relaxed. We were about forty minutes from home now. I started to let it drop. I didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t seem too happy about something,\" I said, a definite edge to my voice. My own temper was fraying around the edges. I knew I was heading in the wrong direction conversationally; I knew I should just be content with silence, however brooding and pregnant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric took the exit for Bon Temps and turned south.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes, instead of going down the road less taken, you just charge right down the beaten path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would there be something wrong with me rescuing the two of you?\" We were driving through Bon Temps now. Eric turned east after the buildings along Main gradually thinned and vanished. We passed Merlotte\u0027s, still open. We turned south again, on a small parish road. Then we were bumping down my driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric pulled over and killed the engine. \"Yes,\" he said. \"There is something wrong with that. And why the hell don\u0027t you get your driveway fixed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe string of tension that had stretched between us popped. I was out of the car in a New York minute, and he was, too. We faced each other across the roof of the Lincoln, though not much of me showed. I charged around it until I was right in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I can\u0027t afford it, that\u0027s why! I don\u0027t have any money! And you all keep asking me to take time off from my job to do stuff for you! I can\u0027t! I can\u0027t do it anymore!\" I shrieked. \"I quit!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long moment of silence while Eric regarded me. My chest was heaving underneath my stolen jacket. Something felt funny, something was bothering me about the appearance of my house, but I was too het up to examine my worry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bill ...\" Eric began cautiously, and it set me off like a rocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s spending all his money on the freaking Bellefleurs,\" I said, my tone this time low and venomous, but no less sincere. \"He never thinks about giving me money. And how could I take it? It would make me a kept woman, and I\u0027m not his whore, I\u0027m his ... I used to be his girlfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep, shuddering breath, dismally aware that I was going to cry. It would be better to get mad again. I tried. \"Where do you get off, telling them that I\u0027m your ... your lover? Where\u0027d that come from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to the money you earned in Dallas?\" Eric asked, taking me completely by surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I paid my property taxes with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you ever think that if you told me where Bill\u0027s hiding his computer program, I would give you anything you asked for? Did you not realize that Russell would have paid you handsomely?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sucked in my breath, so offended, I hardly knew where to begin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see you didn\u0027t think of those things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah, I\u0027m just an angel.\" Actually, none of those things had occurred to me, and I was almost defensive they hadn\u0027t. I was shaking with fury, and all my good sense went out the window. I would feel the presence of other brains at work, and the fact that someone was in my place enraged me farther. The rational part of my mind crumpled under the weight of my anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone\u0027s waiting in my house, Eric.\" I swung around and stomped over to my porch, finding the key I\u0027d hidden under the rocker my grandmother had loved. Ignoring everything my brain was trying to tell me, ignoring the beginning of a bellow from Eric, I opened the front door and got hit with a ton of bricks. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/club-dead-sookie-stackhouse-3/page-13.html","bookId":2193,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:54 PM"}
