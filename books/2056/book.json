First there\u0027s her relationship with gorgeous bestselling writer Seth Mortensen, which is unsatisfying on a number of levels. It\u0027s not just that they can\u0027t have sex in case Georgina inadvertently kills him (generally a turn-off for most guys). Lately, even spending time together is a challenge. Seth\u0027s obsessed with finishing his latest novel, and Georgina\u0027s under demonic orders to mentor the new (and surprisingly inept) succubus on the block.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/succubus-dreams-georgina-kincaid-3.jpg","author":"Richelle Mead","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-dreams-georgina-kincaid-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:18 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:55:35 PM"}
