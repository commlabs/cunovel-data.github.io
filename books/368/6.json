DISK 2.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eENCRYPTED\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMY father had finally regained consciousness. I was, of course, relieved, but his last words to me that day were chasing themselves around in my mind.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Gold isn’t all-important, Arty’ he had said. ‘Neither is power. We have everything we need right here. The three of us.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWas it possible that the magic had transformed my father? I had to know. I needed to speak to him alone. So, at 3 a.m. the following morning, I had Butler bring me back to Helsinki’s University Hospital in the rented Mercedes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFather was still awake, reading War and Peace by lamplight. ‘Not many laughs’ he commented. More jokes. I tried to smile, but my face just wasn’t in the mood.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFather closed the book. ‘I’ve been expecting you, Arty. We need to talk. There are a few things we have to straighten out.’ I stood stiffly at the foot of the bed. ‘Yes, Father. I agree.’ Father’s smile was tinged with sadness. ‘So formal. I remember being the same with my own father. I sometimes think that he didn’t know me at all, and I worry that the same thing will happen to us. So I want us to talk, son, not about bank accounts. Not stocks and shares. Not corporate takeovers. I don’t want to talk business, I want to talk about you.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI had been afraid of this. ‘Me? You are the priority here, Father.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Perhaps, but I cannot be happy until your mother’s mind is put at rest.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘At rest?’ I asked, as though I didn’t know where this was going.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Don’t play the innocent, Artemis. I’ve called a few of my law-enforcement contacts around Europe. Apparently you have been active in my absence. Very active.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged, unsure whether I was being scolded or praised.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Not so long ago I would have been very impressed by your antics. Such audacity and still a minor. But now, speaking as a father,\u0026nbsp; things\u0026nbsp; have\u0026nbsp; to\u0026nbsp; change, Arty. You\u0026nbsp; must\u0026nbsp; reclaim your childhood. It is my wish, and your mother’s, that you return to school after the holidays and leave the family’s business to me.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘But, Father!’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Trust me, Arty. I’ve been in business a lot longer than you. I have promised your mother that the Fowls are on the straight and narrow from now on. All of the Fowls. I have another chance, and I will not waste it on greed. We are a family now. A proper one. From now on the Fowl name will be associated with honour and honesty. Agreed?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Agreed,’ I said, clasping his hand.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut what of my meeting with Chicago’s Jon Spiro? I decided to proceed as planned. One last adventure — then the Fowls could be a proper family. After all, Butler would accompany me. What could go wrong?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFOWL MANOR\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eButler opened his eyes. He was home. Artemis was asleep in the armchair beside the bed. The boy looked a hundred years old. It wasn’t surprising after all he’d been through. That life was over now though. All of it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Anybody home?’ said the manservant.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eArtemis was instantly alert.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Butler, you’ve come back to us.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eButler struggled on to his elbows. It was quite an effort.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s a surprise to me. I never expected to see you, or anyone, ever again.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eArtemis poured a glass of water from the bedside jug.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Here, old friend. Just rest.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eButler drank slowly. He was tired, but it was more than that. He had felt battle fatigue before, but this went deeper.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Artemis, what has happened? I shouldn’t be alive at all. And if I accept that I am alive, then I should be experiencing massive amounts of pain right about now.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eArtemis crossed to the window, looking out over the estate.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Blunt shot you. It was a fatal wound, and Holly wasn’t around to help, so I froze you until she arrived.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eButler shook his head. ‘Cryogenics? Only Artemis Fowl. You used the fish freezers, I suppose?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eArtemis nodded.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I trust I am not part freshwater trout now, eh?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWhen Artemis turned to face his friend, he was not smiling.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘There were complications.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Complications?’ \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eArtemis took a breath. ‘It was a difficult healing — no way to predict the outcome. Foaly warned that it might be too much for your system, but I insisted we press on.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eButler sat up. ‘Artemis. It’s all right. I’m alive. Anything is better than the alternative.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eArtemis was not reassured. He took a pearl-handled mirror from the locker.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Prepare yourself, and take a look.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eButler took a deep breath and looked. He stretched his jaw and pinched the bags beneath his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Just how long was I out?’ he asked.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTRANSATLANTIC BOEING 747\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMulch had decided that the best way to undermine the mission was to antagonize Loafers until he went crazy. Driving people crazy was a talent of his, and one that he did not get to exercise often enough.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe two diminutive individuals were seated side by side in a 747, watching the clouds shoot past below. First class: one of the perks of working for the Antonellis.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMulch sipped delicately from a champagne flute.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘So, Slippers . . .’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘That’s Loafers.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh yes, Loafers. What’s the story behind all the tattoos?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLoafers rolled up his sleeve, revealing a turquoise snake with drops of blood for eyes. Another of his own designs.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I get one done after every job.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh,’ said Mulch. ‘So if you paint a kitchen, then you get a tattoo?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Not that kind of job, stupid.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘What kind of job then?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLoafers ground his teeth. ‘Do I have to spell it out for you?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMulch pinched some peanuts from a passing tray.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘No point. I never got no schoolin’. Plain English will be fine.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘You can’t be this stupid! Spatz Antonelli doesn’t hire morons.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMulch gave a smarmy wink. ‘You sure about that?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLoafers patted his shirt, hoping to find a weapon of some kind.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘You wait until this is over, smart alec. Me and you will settle our differences.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘You keep telling yourself that, Boots.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Loafers!’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Whatever.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMulch hid behind the airline magazine. This was too easy. The mobster was half-crazed already. A few more hours in Mulch’s company should be enough to have Loafers McGuire foaming at the mouth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDUBLIN AIRPORT, IRELAND\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMulch and Loafers passed through Irish customs without incident. After all, they were simply citizens returning home for the holidays. It wasn’t as if they were a Mob team up to no good. How could they be? Whoever heard of little people being involved in organized crime? Nobody. But maybe that was because they were very good at it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePassport control provided Mulch with another opportunity to infuriate his partner.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe officer was doing his best not to notice Mulch’s height, or lack of it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘So, Mister Digence, home to visit the family?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMulch nodded. ‘That’s right. My mother’s folks are from Killarney.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, really?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘O’Reilly, actually. But what’s a vowel between friends?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Very good. You should be on the stage.’ ‘It’s funny you should mention that -The passport officer groaned. Ten more minutes and his shift would have been over.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I was being sarcastic actually . . .’ he muttered. - because my friend Mister McGuire and I are also doing a stint in the Christmas pantomime. It’s Snow White. I’m Doc, and he’s Dopey.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe passport officer forced a smile. ‘Very good. Next.’ Mulch spoke for the entire queue to hear. ‘Of course, Mister McGuire there was born to play Dopey, if you catch my drift.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLoafers lost it right there in the terminal. ‘You little freak!’ he screamed. ‘I’ll kill you! You’ll be my next tattoo. You’ll be my next tattoo!’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMulch tutted as Loafers disappeared beneath half a dozen security guards.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Actors,’ he said. ‘Highly strung.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e*\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey released Loafers three hours later after a full search and several phone calls to the parish priest in his home town. Mulch was waiting in the pre-ordered rental car, a specially modified model with elevated accelerator and brake pedals.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Your temper is seriously jeopardizing this operation,’ commented the dwarf, straight-faced. ‘I’ll have to phone Miss Frazetti if you can’t control yourself.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Drive,’ said the metal man hoarsely. ‘Let’s get this over with.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘OK then. But you’re on your very last chance. One more episode like that and I’m going to have to crush your head between my teeth.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLoafers noticed his partner’s teeth for the first time. They were tombstone-shaped blocks of enamel, and there seemed to be an awful lot of them for just one mouth. Was it possible that Digence could actually do what he threatened? No, Loafers decided. He was just a bit spooked after the customs interrogation. Still, there was something about the dwarf’s smile. A glint that spoke of hidden and frightening talents. Talents that the metal man would prefer to stay hidden.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMulch took care of the driving while Loafers made a couple of calls on his mobile phone. It was a simple matter for him to contact a few old associates and arrange for a weapon, a silencer and two headsets to be left in a duffel bag behind the motorway exit sign for Fowl Manor. Loafers’ associates even took credit cards, so there was no need for the usual macho trade-off that generally accompanied black-market transactions.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLoafers checked the weapon’s action and sights in the car. He felt in control again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘So, Mo,’ said Loafers, chuckling as if that simple rhyme was the funniest joke he had ever made. And sadly, it was. ‘Have you put together a plan yet?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMulch didn’t take his eyes from the road. ‘Nope. I thought you were the head honcho here. Plans are your department. I just break and enter.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘That’s right. I am the head honcho, and believe me Master Fowl is going to realize that too when I’m finished talking to him.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Master Fowl?’ said Mulch innocently. ‘We’re here for some kid?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Not just some kid,’ revealed Loafers, against orders. ‘Artemis Fowl. Heir to the Fowl criminal empire. He has something in his head that Miss Frazetti wants. So we’re supposed to impress upon the little brat how important it is that he come with us and spill the beans.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMulch’s grip tightened on the wheel. He should have made his move before now. But the trick was not to incapacitate Loafers, it was persuading Carla Frazetti not to send another team.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eArtemis would know what to do. He had to get to the boy before Loafers did. A mobile phone and a visit to the bathroom were all he needed. A pity he had never bothered purchasing a phone, but there had never been anybody to call before. Besides, you could never be too careful with Foaly. That centaur could triangulate a chirping cricket.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘We better stop for supplies,’ said Loafers. ‘It could take days to check this place out.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘No need. I know the layout. I burgled it before, in my youth. Piece of cake.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘And you didn’t mention this before because Mulch made a rude gesture at a lorry driver hogging both lanes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘You know the way it is. I work on commission. The commission is calculated on a hardship basis. The second I say I turned this place over before, ten grand is cut off my fee.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLoafers didn’t argue. It was true. You always exaggerated the difficulty of the job. Anything to squeeze a few more bucks out of your employer.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘So, you can get us in there?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I can get me in there. Then I come back out for you.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLoafers was suspicious. ‘Why don’t I just come with you? It would be a lot easier than hanging around in broad daylight.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Firstly, I’m not going in until after dark. And secondly, sure you can come with me, if you don’t mind crawling through the septic tank and up nine metres of effluent pipe.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLoafers had to open a window at the thought of it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘OK. You come get me. But we stay in contact over the headsets. Anything goes wrong and you let me know.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, sir, boss,’ said Mulch, screwing the earpiece into a hairy ear and clipping the mike to his jacket. ‘Wouldn’t want you to miss your appointment intimidating a kid.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe sarcasm made a slight whistling noise as it flew over Loafer’s head.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘That’s right,’ said the Kilkenny man. ‘I am the boss. And you don’t want to make me late for my appointment.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMulch had to concentrate to stop his beard hair curling. Dwarf hair is very mood-sensitive, especially to hostility, and it was flowing out of this man’s every pore. Mulch’s bristles had never been wrong yet. This little partnership was not going to end well.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMulch\u0026nbsp; parked\u0026nbsp; in\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; shadow\u0026nbsp; of the\u0026nbsp; Fowl\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Estate’s boundary wall.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘You certain this is the place?’ asked Loafers.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMulch pointed a stubby finger at the ornate iron gate.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘You see there where it says Fowl Manor?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I’d say this was probably the place.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eEven Loafers couldn’t miss a direct jibe like that.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘You better get me in there, Digence, or . . .’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMulch showed him the teeth. ‘Or what?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Or Miss Frazetti will be extremely annoyed,’ completed Loafers lamely, well aware that he was losing the hard-man-banter battle. Loafers resolved to teach Mo Digence a lesson as soon as possible.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘We wouldn’t want to annoy Miss Frazetti,’ said Mulch. He climbed down from the elevated seat and reclaimed his gear bag from the trunk. There were certain unorthodox burglary tools in the bag, supplied by his fairy contact in New York. Hopefully none of them would be needed. Not the way he intended gaining entrance to the manor.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMulch rapped on the passenger window. Loafers buzzed it open.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘What?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Remember, you stay here until I come and get you.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘That sounds like an order, Digence. Are you giving me orders now?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Me?’ said Mulch, revealing the full expanse of his teeth. ‘Giving orders? I wouldn’t dream of it.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLoafers buzzed the window back up.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘You better not be,’ he said as soon as there was a layer of toughened glass between him and those teeth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eInside Fowl Manor, Butler had just finished clipping and shaving. He was beginning to look like his old self again. His older self.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Kevlar, you say?’ he repeated, examining the darkened tissue on his chest.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eArtemis nodded. ‘Apparently some fibres were trapped in the wound. The magic replicated them. According to Foaly, the new tissue will restrict your breathing, but it isn’t dense enough to be bulletproof, except for a small-calibre bullet.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eButler buttoned his shirt. ‘Everything is different, Artemis. I can’t guard you any more.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I won’t need guarding. Holly was right. My grand schemes generally lead to people getting hurt. As soon as we have dealt with Spiro I intend to concentrate on my education.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘As soon as we have dealt with Spiro? You make it sound like a foregone conclusion. Jon Spiro is a dangerous man, Artemis. I thought you would have learned that.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I have, old friend. Believe me, I won’t underestimate him again. I have already begun to formulate a plan. We should be able to retrieve the C Cube and neutralize Mister Spiro, providing Holly agrees to help.’ ‘Where is Holly? I need to thank her. Again.’ Artemis glanced out of the window. ‘She has gone to complete the Ritual. You can guess where.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eButler nodded. They had first encountered Holly at a sacred fairy site in the south-east while she was conducting the power-restoring Ritual. Although ‘encountered’ was not the term Holly used. ‘Abducted’ was closer to the truth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘She should be back within the hour. I suggest you rest until then.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eButler shook his head. ‘I can rest later. Right now, I have to check the grounds. It’s unlikely that Spiro could put a team together so quickly. But you never know.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe bodyguard crossed to a wall panel that linked his room to the security-system control booth. Artemis could see that each step was an effort. With Butler’s new chest tissue, just climbing the stairs would seem like a marathon.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eButler split-screened his monitor so he could view all the CCTVs simultaneously. One of the screens interested him more than the others, so he punched it up on the monitor.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, well,’ he chuckled. ‘Look who’s dropped in to say hello.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eArtemis crossed to the security panel. There was a very small individual making rude gestures at the kitchen-door camera.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Mulch Diggums,’ said Artemis. ‘Just the dwarf I wanted to see.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eButler transferred Mulch’s image to the main screen.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Perhaps. But why does he want to see you?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMelodramatic as always, the dwarf insisted on a sandwich before explaining the situation. Unfortunately for Mulch, it was Artemis who volunteered to prepare it for him. He emerged from the pantry with what resembled nothing more than an explosion on a plate.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s more difficult than it looks,’ explained the boy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMulch cranked open his massive jaws, pouring the whole pile down in one swallow. After several minutes’ chewing, he reached an entire hand into his mouth and dislodged a chunk of roast turkey.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Next time more mustard,’ he said, brushing some crumbs from his shirt and, in the process, inadvertently switching on the mike clipped there. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘You’re welcome,’ said Artemis.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘You should be thanking me, Mud Boy,’ said Mulch. ‘I came all the way from Chicago to save your life. Surely that’s\u0026nbsp; worth\u0026nbsp; one\u0026nbsp; lousy\u0026nbsp; sandwich? And\u0026nbsp; when\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; I\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; say sandwich I mean it in the loosest sense of the word.’ \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Chicago? Jon Spiro sent you?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe dwarf shook his head. ‘Possibly, but not directly. I work for the Antonelli family. Of course, they have no idea that I am an actual fairy dwarf; they think I’m simply the best cat burglar in the business.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Chicago’s district attorney has linked the Antonellis to Spiro in the past. Or rather, he’s tried to.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Whatever. Anyway, the plan is that I break in here, and then my partner encourages you to accompany us to Chicago.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eButler was leaning against the table. ‘Where is your partner now, Mulch?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Outside the gate. He’s the small angry one. Glad to see you’re alive by the way, big man. There was a rumour going around the underworld that you were dead.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I was,’ said Butler, heading for the security booth. ‘But I’m better now.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLoafers took a small spiral pad from his breast pocket. In it he had recorded any quips that he felt had really worked in dangerous situations. Snappy dialogue, that was the trademark of a good gangster — according to the movies at any rate. He flicked through the pages, smiling fondly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s time to close your account. Permanently.’ - Larry Ferrigamo. Bent banker. 9th August.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I’m afraid your hard drive has just been wiped.’ — David Spinski. Computer hacker. 23rd September.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I’m doing this ‘cause I knead the dough.’ — Morty the Baker. 17th July.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was good material. Maybe he would write his memoirs some day.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLoafers was still chuckling when he heard Mo talking in his earpiece. At first he thought the monkey was speaking to him, but then he realized that his so-called partner was spilling the beans to their pigeon.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘You should be thanking me, Mud Boy,’ said Digence. ‘I came all the way from Chicago to save your life.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTo save his life! Mo was working for the other side and the little idiot had forgotten about his mike.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLoafers climbed out of the car, being careful to lock it. He would lose the deposit if the rental was stolen, and Miss Frazetti would take it out of his commission. There was a small pedestrian entrance in the wall beside the main gate. Mo Digence had left it open. Loafers slipped through and hurried down the avenue, careful to stay in the shadow of the trees.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn his ear, Mo kept rabbiting on. He laid out their entire plan to the Fowl kid without so much as the threat of torture. It was completely voluntary. Digence had somehow been working for the Irish kid all along. And what’s more, Mo was not Mo, he was Mulch. What kind of a name was that? Mulch, who was apparently a fairy dwarf. This was getting weirder and weirder. Maybe the fairy dwarfs were some kind of gang. Although it wasn’t much of a gang name. The fairy dwarfs were hardly going to strike terror into the hearts of the competition.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLoafers trotted up the avenue, past a line of elegant silver birches and an honest-to-God croquet pitch. Two peacocks strutted around the edge of a water feature. Loafers snorted. Water feature! In the days before TV gardeners it would have been called a pond.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLoafers was wondering where the delivery entrance was when he saw the sign: ‘Deliveries at rear’. Thank you very much. He checked his silencer and load one more time, and tiptoed across the gravel driveway.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eArtemis sniffed the air. ‘What’s that smell?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMulch poked his head round the refrigerator door.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Me, I’m afraid,’ he mumbled, an unfeasible amount of food revolving inside his mouth. ‘Sunblock. Disgusting, I know, but I’d smell a whole lot worse without it. Think bacon strips on a flat rock in Death Valley.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘A charming image.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Dwarfs are subterranean creatures,’ explained Mulch. ‘Even during the Frond Dynasty we lived underground . . .’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFrond was the first elfin king. During his reign, fairies and humans had shared the earth’s surface.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘. . . Being photosensitive makes it difficult to exist among humans. To be honest, I’m a bit fed up of this life.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Your wish is my command,’ said a voice. It was Loafers. He was standing at the kitchen door, brandishing a very large gun.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn fairness to Mulch, he recovered well.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I thought I told you to wait outside.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s true, you did. But I decided to come in anyway. And guess what? No septic tank, no effluent pipe. The back door is wide open.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMulch tended to grind his teeth when he thought. It sounded like nails being scraped down a chalkboard.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;‘Ah . . . yes. A stroke of luck there. I took advantage of it, but unfortunately I was interrupted by the boy. I had just gained his confidence when you burst in.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Don’t bother,’ said Loafers. ‘Your mike is on. I heard the whole thing, Mo. Or should I say Mulch, the fairy dwarf?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMulch swallowed the half-chewed mass of food. Once again his big mouth had got him into trouble — maybe it could get him out of trouble too. It was just possible that he could unhinge his jaw and swallow the little hit man. He’d eaten bigger. A quick burst of dwarf gas should be enough to propel him across the room. He’d just have to hope that the gun didn’t go off before he could pass it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLoafers caught the look in Mulch’s eye. ‘That’s right, little man,’ he said, cocking his pistol. ‘You go for it. See how far you get.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eArtemis was thinking too. He knew that he was safe for the moment. The newcomer would not harm him against orders. But Mulch’s time was running out and there was no one to save him. Butler was too weak to intervene even if he had been here. Holly was away completing the Ritual. And Artemis himself was not the best in physical situations. He would have to negotiate.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I know what you’re here for,’ he began. ‘The Cube’s secrets. I’ll tell you, but not if you harm my friend.’ Loafers waved the gun barrel. ‘You’ll do whatever I ask,\u0026nbsp; when I ask.\u0026nbsp; Possibly\u0026nbsp; you’ll cry like a girl too. Sometimes that happens.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Very well. I’ll tell you what you want to know. Just don’t shoot anyone.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLoafers swallowed a grin. ‘Sure. That’s fine. You just come with me, nice and quiet, and I won’t hurt a soul. You have my word.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eButler entered the kitchen. His face was slick with perspiration and his breath came in short gasps.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I checked the monitor,’ he said. ‘The car is empty, the other man must be . . .’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Here,’ completed Loafers. ‘Old news to everyone except you, Grandad. Now, no sudden moves and you might not have a heart attack.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eArtemis saw Butler’s eyes flitting around the room. He was searching for an angle. Some way to save them. Maybe yesterday’s Butler could have done it, but today’s Butler was fifteen years older and not yet fully recovered from magical surgery. The situation was desperate.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘You could tie the others up,’ ventured Artemis. Then we could leave together.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLoafers smacked his own head. ‘What a great idea! Then maybe I could agree to some other delaying tactic, on account of me being a complete amateur.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLoafers felt a shadow fall across his back. He spun round to see a girl standing in the doorway. Another witness. Carla Frazetti would be getting the bill for all these sundries. This whole job had been misrepresented from the start.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘OK, miss,’ said Loafers. ‘Go join the others. And don’t do anything stupid.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe girl at the door flicked her hair over one shoulder, blinking her glittering green eyelids.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘I don’t do stupid things,’ she said. Then her hand flicked out, brushing against Loafer’s weapon. She grabbed the pistol’s slide and deftly twisted it from the stock. The gun was now completely useless, except for hammering nails.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLoafers jerked backwards. ‘Hey, hey. Watch it. I don’t want to wound you by accident. This gun could go off.’ That’s what he thought.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLoafers continued brandishing his piece of harmless metal.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Back off, little girl. I won’t say it again.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eJuliet dangled the slide under his nose. ‘Or what? You’ll shoot me with this?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLoafers stared cross-eyed at the piece of metal.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Hey, that looks just like Then Juliet hit him in the chest so hard he crashed through the breakfast bar.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMulch stared over at the unconscious mobster, then at the girl in the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e‘Hey, Butler. Just a shot in the dark here, but I’d say that’s your sister.’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;‘You’re right,’\u0026nbsp; said the manservant, hugging Juliet tightly. ‘How on earth did you guess?’\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/83/263.html","bookId":368,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 1:35:09 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 1:35:09 AM"}
