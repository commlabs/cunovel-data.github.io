There was an audible gasp from the crowds gathered below, then screams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve just chased an innocent woman to her death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy hadn\u0027t Grace waited? If he\u0027d only had a chance to talk to her. To tell her he believed in her. That he knew Lenny hadn\u0027t killed himself. That he knew she was innocent. That he was starting to fall in love with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t bear to look, yet he knew he had to. Behind him, a stream of cops had filed onto the rooftop, all with guns drawn. Mitch walked forward slowly to the spot where the blue flash had disappeared. Squatting down on his haunches, he took a deep, fortifying breath and looked down, bracing himself for the sight of Grace\u0027s bloodied, broken corpse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sidewalk was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe roof jutted out about two feet beyond the outer walls of the hospital building, like stiff white icing spilling over the edge of a wedding cake. Lying on his belly, Mitch reached under the ledge. His fingers grasped at the air. Nothing. He inched farther forward, like a snake, till his torso dangled perilously over the edge of the building. The crowd gasped again. Suddenly Mitch felt a small, cold hand in his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerched on a window ledge no more than eight inches wide, Grace looked up into Mitch\u0027s eyes and gave him a sad, defeated smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Detective Connors. We must stop meeting like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE SENSATIONAL FOOTAGE OF GRACE BROOKSTEIN\u0027S capture was aired around the globe. Overnight, Mitch Connors of the NYPD went from bumbling cop to national hero. Speculation was rife as to where America\u0027s most wanted fugitive was being held. Would Grace be sent back to Bedford Hills? Or to a different, secret, more secure location? Would there be another trial? The hunt for Grace Brookstein had cost the U.S. taxpayers millions of dollars. Surely some stiffening of Grace\u0027s original sentence was called for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind the scenes, an interagency battle raged. Everyone wanted access to Grace. Mitch Connors\u0027s view was that possession was nine-tenths of the law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got her and we\u0027re not handing her over to the FBI, or anyone else, till we\u0027re done questioning her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the FBI\u0027s Harry Bain wasn\u0027t the only one on Mitch\u0027s case. His own superiors in the police department seemed eager to wash their hands of Grace as soon as possible. Detective Lieutenant Dubray agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not our problem anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch dug his heels in. \"I have a right to question her for forty-eight hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t lecture me about your \u0027rights,\u0027 Connors. And don\u0027t be so fucking naive. This case is political dynamite and you know it. Grace Brookstein\u0027s a walking embodiment of everything this country\u0027s trying to forget. This goes all the way to the top. The president himself has told his advisers that Grace\u0027s face on the news is bad for business, bad for jobs, bad for Brand America.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Brand America\u0027? Come on, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch fought his corner, but he knew time was running out. Soon Grace would be taken away from him, and his chance to help her would be gone. Whatever other feelings he had, or thought he had, for her, he had to put them aside. All that mattered now was the truth. I have to get her to trust me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGRACE STUDIED MITCH\u0027S FEATURES INTENTLY. He seems genuine. But then my track record as a judge of character is hardly exemplary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re saying you want to help me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I want to help you. I\u0027m the only one who wants to help you, Grace. But I can\u0027t if you don\u0027t talk to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace looked at him skeptically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I read Buccola\u0027s file,\" said Mitch. \"I believe that Lenny was murdered. I believe that you were both set up. But I need your help to prove it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you know Lenny was murdered, why haven\u0027t you reopened the investigation into his death?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tried to. I was blocked. My superiors were more interested in capturing you than in finding out the truth about Quorum, or what may have happened on that boat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re different. That\u0027s what you want me to believe, right? That you\u0027re a lone warrior for truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, I don\u0027t blame you for distrusting me. But I don\u0027t have time to convince you. In a few hours, the powers that be are gonna take you away from here. We may never get another opportunity to speak to each other. This is our last chance, your last chance. Tell me what you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What I know?\" Grace laughed bitterly. \"I don\u0027t know anything anymore. Everything I thought I knew turned out to be a lie. I thought I was rich, but it turned out I had nothing. I thought the courts would protect the innocent, but they sent me to jail. I thought my friends and family loved me, but they were nothing but a pack of vultures. I thought Lenny died in an accident. I thought he was a faithful husband. I thought...I thought he loved me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears rolled down her cheeks. Without thinking, Mitch walked around the interview table and put his arms around her. She was so tiny, so vulnerable. He was overwhelmed with an urge to protect her, to rescue her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure Lenny loved you,\" he whispered, stroking her newly shorn, white-blond hair. \"People have affairs. They\u0027re weak. They make mistakes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe told her how close he\u0027d come to catching her at Jasmine Delevigne\u0027s apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was that why you tried to kill yourself? Because of Connie and Lenny?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Grace said hotly. \"And I didn\u0027t try to kill myself. I - \" She broke off. She wanted to tell him about the abortion, about the rape, about all of it, but she didn\u0027t have the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch said, \"He broke it off with Connie, you know. Before he died. Your sister was blackmailing Lenny, threatening to tell you about their affair. He\u0027d already paid fifteen million into an offshore account for her, but Connie was squeezing him for more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was she? How do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She told me herself. Bragged about it, if you must know. The point is, Lenny was desperate not to hurt you, Grace. Not to lose you. He regretted what happened, I\u0027m sure of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace closed her eyes and succumbed to the comfort of Mitch\u0027s arms around her. It had been so long since she\u0027d had intimate contact with another human being. So long since she\u0027d felt kindness, warmth, affection. That\u0027s all this is, she told herself firmly. Affection. A moment\u0027s break in the battle. In another life, another world, things might have been different. As it was...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a knock on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, boss.\" The officer was hesitant. He liked Mitch and hated being the bearer of bad news. \"Dubray says you\u0027ve got five minutes. We got orders direct from Washington. The prisoner\u0027s being transferred out of state.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he\u0027d gone, Mitch clasped Grace\u0027s hand. There was a connection between them. He could see she felt it, too. \"Talk to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace told him everything she knew. When she was done, Mitch said, \"You realize who\u0027s left, don\u0027t you? If Andrew Preston and Jack Warner and your sister Connie are all innocent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace sighed. \"John Merrivale. But it wasn\u0027t him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound very sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suspected John from the beginning. I know he set me up at my trial, and who knows, maybe he took that money. But he couldn\u0027t have killed Lenny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was in Boston the day Lenny took the boat out. Davey checked out his alibi months ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, so did I.\" Mitch looked thoughtful. He remembered his lunch with John Merrivale, the way his speech impediment had magically disappeared when he spoke about the day Lenny Brookstein disappeared. \"Still. There\u0027s something not right about that man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace stared blankly at the door. Mitch thought, She doesn\u0027t care anymore. She\u0027s given up. When she spoke, there was neither fear nor curiosity in her voice. \"Do you know where they\u0027re taking me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But I\u0027ll find out.\" Once again Mitch found himself gripped with the urge to rescue her. What was it about this woman that brought out his inner knight in shining armor? \"I\u0027ll do my best to help you, Grace. Get you a decent lawyer, begin an appeal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want any of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you have to...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked him in the eye. \"If you want to help me, find out who murdered my husband. I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll ever be able to clear his name of the Quorum fraud. But I\u0027d like people to know Lenny wasn\u0027t a coward. That he didn\u0027t kill himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll try. But, Grace, even if I succeed, Lenny\u0027s dead. You\u0027re alive. You have your whole life ahead of you. You must get a new lawyer. You must appeal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe officer reappeared, along with two more armed officers and a dour-faced man in a suit. CIA? FBI? \"Time to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace stood up. Impulsively, she kissed Mitch on the cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch watched the men take her away. After she\u0027d gone, he stood in the empty interview room for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForget about you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only I could. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/after-the-darkness/page-29.html","bookId":2373,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:15:31 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:15:31 AM"}
