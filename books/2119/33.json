The one with presidents and ministers and secretaries of this or that, representing these or those, all decked out and solemn in black and respect. It was the biggest funeral ever, somebody had said. Everyone who was anyone, everywhere that was anywhere, had somebody, a Somebody, in attendance. Nobody wanted to miss the funeral. It was Kent\u0027s funeral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike most people I had watched it. It had been carried on the Fleet beam, no less, and perhaps had the largest audience for any event in history. Such a man! Such a hero! Everybody\u0027s Hero! I had felt pretty much the same way. I hadn\u0027t known any better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a man...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunny the things you think about when you\u0027re tired and scared and only have a second or two to rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was all I had. Half stimules and half painers, I had managed to get Holly and me pretty much fixed up. Medigrips and medipacks everywhere over the cuts and contusions and abrasions. There was a disquieting, and possibly crucial, amount of blood over us. But I figured we would live until they killed us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLya called. I was too numb to think not to answer. She hated me, of course. And she blamed me. For Holly still being there, to begin with. Maybe for him ever being there. And I was a liar too, for not calling her back like I had said I would. True, true, all of it true. All of it and more. I smoked and listened in silence, staring not at her but at the view of Borglyn\u0027s console which he had so generously and sadistically continued to provide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were really screwed. They had the whole riverfront laid out, staked out. They were ready for us. They were waiting for us. They had us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething in Lya\u0027s tone had changed, I realized distantly. I looked up to see the same tears and the same aching pain. But something else had been added. Resignation. Acceptance. Whatever we wanted to do...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuh?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"...should have realized you would never give into them. And Holly... I guess I knew all along, from that first moment when we got here to the valley and he wasn\u0027t with us. He\u0027s just too good a man.\" She paused, whimpered, pulled herself together. She smiled weakly at me. \"And you, too. Jack. You\u0027re both too good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared. Then I mumbled something back about, well, t\u0027weren\u0027t nuthin\u0027. But I was thinking what I had thought long ago-how long ago? A month?-when she had first accepted me along with all the rest of the Jack Crow smoke. You\u0027re a fool, Lya. Still a fool to trust me. It made no difference that now, when it wasn\u0027t going to help, when it was far too late for that, that she could trust me. It made no difference that I would never leave him now. It made no difference that I was about to die with him and for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was still a fool. So were we all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was about to key off when she said, no, there was someone else who wanted to talk to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren. Dry-eyed and stone faced and good-bye. Jack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut too dry-eyed. Too stone-faced. It was on her, too. And because of that, I guess, as much as anything else, it sank upon me at last. It was over, over, over. We were dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I lo... Good-bye, Jack,\" she said and I saw the tears coming at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, feeling my eyes heating up and leaned forward to key off. Her face became alarmed suddenly, and\u0027she asked one last thing. She asked me to tell her that I wasn\u0027t doing this for her in any way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said I wasn\u0027t. Straight-faced and not lying much. Then I keyed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorglyn began to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up, startled, then furious. He was back at the console. He had been listening in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A peeping tom now?\" I asked him. Snarled at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continued to laugh. It was a deep, powerful laugh. Like the rest of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt unnerved me. But I lashed out as if it didn\u0027t, about how he might as well listen in to me while he could and then in on others later because he sure as hell wouldn\u0027t have anybody of his own from now on. Not unless you count the daughter of somebody he was beating to death in another room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll do it, Borglyn.\" I was really rolling now. \"She\u0027ll do it to keep Poppa alive but she\u0027ll hate you. She\u0027ll want to throw up when those fat pig hands and that fat pig body... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cut me off with his raging. I had hit something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t give this to me, Pig. Give it to her. But don\u0027t expect it to keep her from vomiting into those blue eyes. You\u0027re dead and gray and laid open and she\u0027ll see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was very quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it worth it?\" I asked him and smiled ugly through dry caked lips. \"Is it worth what you\u0027ve done to be what you\u0027re gonna have to be for the rest of your life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still quiet. And something else. I remembered the look he had given me that last moment in the ship when he had laughed with such bitterness about Banshee. I had thought Banshee was destroyed and he had laughed in that way that looked like it hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not now. No help from that now, goddammit!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And don\u0027t start on that damned war, Borglyn! A lot of people came through that war.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was excited again. And angry. \"You don\u0027t know anything about it, Crow!\" he roared. \"You... you damned adolescent! You don\u0027t know anything about what it was like, what it meant, how...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice trailed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know one thing, Borglyn. I know it when I see it. And it\u0027s you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes went wide, confused. Vulnerable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the damned war, Borglyn. You and your punks are now. You see any other ants around here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was quiet for a beat or two. Then he leaned forward to the monitor and spoke in a dead voice. Bright red dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re gone. Crow. Gone. I don\u0027t care if you try to give up now or not. Either way. I\u0027m gonna see you stretched and bleeding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I was standing up from my stool and yelling at him and shaking my fist at the screen and saying there wasn\u0027t much chance of that when he was in orbit and safe and hiding and... and still running away from the fighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorglyn screaming back that, by God, he oughta come down there and show me just what the hell fighting really was...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I shouted louder, shouted over his fury and outrage with fury and outrage of my own and more, with the fear the sight of him gave me. \"You come down here. Pig, and I\u0027ll cut them off and bounce them on the bridge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoddammit! He was coming right now\u0027. And he yelled at somebody to take her down and then he whirled back to glare at me and together, against each other, we reached up and keyed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMen are so cute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI woke Holly. Borglyn was sure to lighten a bit on the way down. And it was never going to be a case of dueling pistols anyway. I was going to have to get to him on my own. But he would be there! He would be on the planet and in range of some kind of chance, some kind of scheme...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. The Plan had raised its throbbing head at last. Holly refused unless he could play too. He looked at me with those bloodshot darting eyes and refused. He was pale and shaking and hurt. But still he wouldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re gonna have to have some support fire. Jack. You haven\u0027t got a chance without it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dammit, Holly! I haven\u0027t a chance anyway. Stay out of it. Just show me how to blow what\u0027s left of the outer room and...\"I got a bad thought. \"What about after that? Will I be able to get the door open once I\u0027ve blown the bastards in front of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled weakly. \"The door will spring,\" he assured me. \"I\u0027ll do it for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him. \"No need. Just tell me how.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn! So cute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a lot more painers to get him going again. That and stimules. On second thought, I took a bunch myself. Why hold back now? I loaded up on other things, too. On blaze pistols clipped on everywhere. And a rifle with extra charges and a row or two of concussion grenades. Not enough to get me across the river to the Coyote-there weren\u0027t enough in the universe to do that alone-but maybe enough for my little Plan. Maybe enough to get to one of the commandos wearing that open-air armor. Anybody could wear open-air. It wasn\u0027t like Felix\u0027s specially built black suit. And once I had that on, and with perhaps a break or two...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then we were at the door, me loaded down with goodies and Holly equally burdened with two blaze-rifles and the medigrips piled around his leg and other places, making him walk bowlegged behind. I didn\u0027t want to waste any time on the off-chance that Borglyn would tell them I was coming out. I didn\u0027t think he would think of it. But still, I knew the people outside would never expect it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood crouched before the door and nodded to Holly, by the panel. He keyed the blast. It shook the floor and the door. It blew, according to Holly, the outer room, floors and ceiling and gash and commandos down the hill toward or in the river. It was very loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now spring the door,\" I urged him. I didn\u0027t want to wait an instant for them to recover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolly nodded. He keyed the switch for \"open.\" That\u0027s all it took. I snarled at him as I raced forward. He laughed and stumbled along behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Plan was for me to rush out ahead to find cover. Then I would support Holly\u0027s exit against any resistance that might be left from the first blast. Holly could thereafter support my charge down the hill over the ridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe never had a prayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blast had done its job well enough. There was no sign of the front chamber except for the huge chunks of masonry scattered about. As I leaped forward to the first boulder-sized one, however, I knew it was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were waiting at the ridge, safe and secure and already firing, already filling the air with the arcing grenades. I spun around to yell at Holly to stop! \"Stay where you are! Holly! I\u0027m coming back in...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then it was too late. The first blasts hit and we both went down. I saw him slammed against a jagged cornice and lay stunned. I tried crawling toward him but then the air was full of blue beams and dust from the blasts. I felt a surge of heat along my thigh and jerked it out of the open. I couldn\u0027t get across the open space to him. I was cut off. But he was exposed! He was open to their fire and the blasts, without any protection at all but a difficult angle up from the ridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ridges. The other side opened up about then. And then from two sides the air was filled with beams and grenades and dust and slamming rocking noise. I tried crawling back to him, curled up around myself to ward off the dust and rock that rattled against the surrounding rubble. But it was no good. No way to get back without being struck by the flying shards. No way to stay. No way to do anything. So I crawled and stumbled forward and things crashed into me, cutting and tearing and crushing and I yelled to Holly that I was sorry, sorry, so sorry that I wasn\u0027t going to make it to help him, I was dying and sorry and Holly? Can you hear me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly moving quickly, sliding roughly across the broken stones. Holly? But Holly was there beside me, sliding along parallel and... What the hell? I strained to lift my head, to see who had us by our collars. But then he no longer did. We were inside the second room once more and he had dropped us flopping on the floor and turned to re-seal the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Lewis. It was the drunk. He was sober. I remembered the hatch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t bother to take us all the way back to the Control- room table. He left us lying where we were and used the medical supplies stacked against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lewis?\" asked Holly suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned, surprised and delighted to see he was still alive. \"Holly! You made it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned, winced from the pain. \"Why not? You did,\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen we both laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis did not. He didn\u0027t speak at all, in fact. He tended to us in grim silence, darting back and forth from body to body with grips and packs and an air of urgency. We weren\u0027t much help. Too tired and too hurt and, come to think of it, too amazed at being alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it was over and we were going to live for another short while, he sat us up against the wall and gave us some water. Then he hauled over a chair and sat down and lit a cigarette and looked at us with that same grim expression, of a parent furious with naughty children, and asked: \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolly tried to tell him. About Borglyn using mortars on the Cityfolk again and again and about how horrible that was and what it meant. About how Borglyn would be so hated now that he would have to be even more brutal later on and how, no, we didn\u0027t think we could beat him exactly, but slowing him down would surely mean something...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe interrupted once. In a cold tone he nodded at me. \"All this for you, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, feeling strangely embarrassed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolly seemed embarrassed, too. He went on, really wanting Lewis to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has to be done, Lewis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis sighed. \"It always does. Holly. That\u0027s no reason to do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But all those people!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolly frowned, stuck. He turned to me. But I couldn\u0027t think either. He turned back to Lewis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lewis, there just isn\u0027t anyone else? Can\u0027t you see that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up, walked a couple of steps. He puffed a puff. He looked down at us. \"Shouldn\u0027t that tell you something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolly faced him. \"I just didn\u0027t see any way out, Lewis. I still don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis frowned. \"Don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t,\" replied Holly in an odd tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him. Tears were starting from his eyes. I shook my head. What the hell was going on?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Lewis was there, right in front of us and crouched down and peering at us with eyes I didn\u0027t know he possessed and he said: \"You can\u0027t? Neither of you? You don\u0027t see any way out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe shook our heads. And then Holly said, in a calm clear voice: \"There isn\u0027t one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis dropped his face into his hands. He rubbed it hard. But then, when he lifted it back up, the grimness had gone. It was replaced with... what? Reckless abandon?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"I was afraid you\u0027d say that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he stood up and stripped off his jumpsuit. He was naked underneath. I heard a groan behind me. I looked and saw that Holly was openly crying now. He must have known then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I didn\u0027t until Lewis walked naked to the far comer of the room and did something that only one human creature in all the universe could do. He touched his open palm to that of the black suit-and it opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVIII\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt couldn\u0027t be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to know how come you\u0027re not dead!\" I demanded idiotically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis/Felix laughed. It was that same carefree abandon as before. Then he winked at me. \"You got a couple of minutes?\" he asked, indicating the door to the outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat wasn\u0027t what I meant. I said so. Holly helped. He asked about Kent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kent\u0027s dead,\" was the uncarefree reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that. He died on Banshee. But what I...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t die on Banshee. He died on the Terra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe looked at each other. I went this time. \"Lew... Felix? Is it Felix?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \" Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We thought Kent killed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. \"He saved me. They killed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fleet,\" he said in a dead voice and knelt down to fiddle with the suit. It had sprung, spread-eagled open, off the wheelchair onto the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a hurried voice. Holly told him what we meant, why we had thought what we thought. When he got to the part about immersing, Felix cringed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really did that? You went through the whole thing with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolly said we had. \"Except between drops. But everything in the suit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix shuddered. \"Still...\" He shuddered again, made an effort to regain his former humor. \"I hope you guys had more fun than I did,\" he said and laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn\u0027t know what to say. We didn\u0027t want to say anything. But we had to know. Holly told him about being there when Kent had struck him and then everything going blank, the Alpha readings dropping out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix smiled. \"I can see your problem. But all that happened was that Kent popped my suit when he hit me. I guess he was afraid I would struggle or something. As if it would have made any difference. Damn! but that man was strong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe nodded, watching in silence as he continued to both talk and work the suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then he put me in a ship. It was... He\u0027d stolen it from someone I... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From Allie?\" Holly prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix looked at him, surprised. Then he nodded slowly. \"That\u0027s right. You know everything. The whole story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really wanted to disappear. But Holly didn\u0027t seem the least bit embarrassed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything in the suit,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix nodded back. He took the cigarette out of his mouth and regarded it lovingly. Then he tossed it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kent put me on the ship and sent me off, still in his armor the whole time. When they tried to find out what was going on, he blocked them.\" Felix stared, remembering. His voice was very quiet when next he spoke. \"I saw what happened from the port. They cut him in half.\" He shrugged, almost violently. \"But I was long gone by then. To here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And all this time...?\" I wondered aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"All this time. Have I got water? I notice I\u0027ve got everything else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolly nodded. \"Fully operational.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blushed, looked at Felix. \"I suppose you think that\u0027s sick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix grinned, then laughed, then giggled wildly, almost falling over. \"Holly? How the hell would I know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he lay down in the suit. And it closed over him. Then they both stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was terrifying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is...is it all right?\" Holly stuttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black helmet nodded. The amplified voice was harsh and deep. It echoed loudly. \"It hurts. I\u0027m out of shape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked loudly and heavily over to the seal and paused with a huge black finger poised over the panel. \"Just key it open?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolly nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to pull myself up, slipped back down. \"Felix...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" boomed back, not unpleasantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh... nothing. Later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Later,\" he echoed. I couldn\u0027t read it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed loudly, electronically. \"I wish you could smoke in here.\" Then he pushed the key and the door opened and he was gone. We heard the blasts begin almost at once. The door, set to close behind him, cut out everything afterward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" shrilled Holly, stumbling across the floor to the Control room. \"I want to see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed. So did I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took us a long time to clamber inside and get the panel working. Our own monitors were long evaporated by battle. And Borglyn had cut us off before. So we missed a lot of it. But Holly managed to jump into Borglyn\u0027s signal anyway. We tried several angles, but none of them got what we wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, we managed to get our old perspective, from the monitor over Borglyn\u0027s shoulder. We could see what he could see. It was great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix was incredible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was everywhere at once. Borglyn couldn\u0027t keep track of him cleanly from his monitors. There were just scattered images. Bodies flying through the air... blaze-bombs or grenades exploding with no one around... blazers cutting off abruptly, shattered and bent... Felix steaming right at the monitor as he reached the edge of the river and leaped across it, all twenty-something meters of it...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the main camp scurrying about and the mortars going off and somebody yelling in a high-pitched strident tone of growing terror that there were no targets, where the hell was he and...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Omigod! There, there, there\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelix was great!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorglyn, on the other hand, was terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lift! Lift, goddammit!\" he yelled to one and all and the Coyote began to rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of his henchmen, in the Control room with him, said something about running scared and the sumbitch not being able to hurt a starship anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorglyn hit him, a loud back-handed smack across the face. \"You said he\u0027d never get across the river! Lift!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the ship was already rising, a few meters up already and then I heard Holly hiss beside me, \"No!\" as we both saw the black suit still coming, loping incredibly fast across the ground. And I knew what he meant. I knew what he feared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Borglyn knew what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All tacticals,\" he yelled to unseen crew around him. \"Discharge them all at once. Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the screens the wall of fire blocked the sight of everything as it swept down across the camp, boiling the mortars and the commandos and the land and everything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the view was eclipsed by interference as the Coyote vaulted suddenly upward into Sanction\u0027s sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just sat there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Holly evidently could not. He began to furiously work the keys, trying blindly, desperately, to restore our view. He almost got it a couple of times, though not well and not clearly. And our fix on the monitor we wanted was clearly lost. We got random snowy pictures from all over the ship, corridors and bulkheads. No sound. No pattern. And no hope. The ship was pulling out of our range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that was the least of it anyway. I reached a hand over and lay it gently on Holly\u0027s. I couldn\u0027t stand to see him torture himself, or me, by trying for...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went stiff when the screen went sharp and clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked where he looked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe image was from the outer portside monitor. It showed the length of the outer hull illuminated against the backdrop of daytime Sanction. And silhouetted against that, right in the center of it...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black suit had one plassteel hand gripped vise-tight on a warp bleeder conduit. The other was clenched into a black fist that hurtled toward the monitor\u0027s single eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then all was dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEPILOGUE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have never found the Coyote, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure, it took us a long time before another ship came and we could even begin the search. And space is big and the ship was out of fuel anyway, so it doesn\u0027t make much difference. But still we looked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo do the people from Golden. Yes, they showed. About a month later. Reluctantly, we told them the story from the beginning when we found the suit until the end when we lost it. And we said we understood how reluctant they must be to want to spend much time searching for the remains of the dead and fuel-less hulk. That we would be staying and if anyone ever reported anything we would be sure to let them know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey looked at us like we were crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Archon was not seen to die, is that not correct?\" the representative asked Holly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolly said that, yes, that\u0027s true, but... There was no fuel. Not to mention the terrible damage the ship undoubtedly underwent. \"I mean,\" Holly blustered on, red-faced, \"There was a battle we didn\u0027t even see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Rep eyed him coolly. \"But the Archon was not seen to die?\" he asked again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolly looked at me and shrugged. \"Well, no,\" he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rep nodded, \"So. We shall continue the search.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they have. They stop by here now and again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of other things:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re not a part of Fleet any longer. In no way. They\u0027re mad about it. Fuck\u0027em.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe traced the rumor about \"Lewis\u0027s\" rich-kid past to-surprise-Lewis himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have a growing colony. A government. Holly and I are on what they call the Council of Elders. But they don\u0027t call us much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLya is pregnant with her second. Her first is a girl with her looks and Holly\u0027s brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren is not pregnant and won\u0027t be. Yes, we\u0027re still together. But we are not, repeat: not, happy. But I guess we\u0027ll keep at it anyhow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never saw Eyes again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Antwar continues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat about me? Besides the fact that I\u0027m getting fat and thoughtful? Not much else. Both traits are, understandably, fulfilling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I eat is everything. What I think about...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe past, of course. My life and what it\u0027s meant and what it will mean from now on. And Felix. I think about Felix a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd about the Masao and what he said, about there being no protection from what you are and all. And I think I may have something to add:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no protection from what you want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell, they keep searching, which is dumb enough. But when I think about the certain look in that Rep\u0027s eye, in all their eyes when they drop by to question again and again. And when I think about all of it-from Golden, to Banshee, to Sanction...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I think about it, I wonder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDammit, I cannot help but wonder:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you there, Felix?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you there? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/armor/page-33.html","bookId":2119,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:55 PM"}
