{"id":82767,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe following afternoon, Becky, Matt, and I were hanging out on Dullsville Highs soccer field waiting for practice to begin. Sebastians fascination for Becky indelibly stuck in my mind. Matt and Becky were nestled together by the home-side goalnot even the threat of an opponents score could break them apart. As my best friend gazed up at her beau adoringly, I realized Id never imagined Becky with anyone but Matt. He was the first boyfriend she ever had and I never doubted that someday theyd be married, live a quiet life in Dullsville with a couple kids, and have the proverbial white picket fence. Even a handsome and love-struck vampire so far hadnt turned her head away from her one true love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian had fallen for a girl who could make him happyif only she liked him back. I was hoping that that would never happen. Not only didnt I want Becky to become a vampire, but I didnt want her to be with anyone besides Matt. But I felt empathy for Sebastian. He didnt choose his amorous fate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the two lovebirds snuggled, I sat alone thinking about my own relationship with my boyfriend. We had bigger challenges that faced us on a daily basis besides an immortal paramour. It was as simple as the sun and as complicated as immortality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander was my soul mate. But was our love strong enough to face the inherent struggles of our two different worlds? If he didnt turn me, would that ultimately come between us? Could we live mortally together while he lived eternally alone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I watched Becky and Matt cuddle, I felt my love for Alexander was not a choice. It was otherworldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexanders life would surely be easier if he were dating a vampire. He wouldnt be in a position to make a life-altering decision. Perhaps I was putting too much pressure on him for my own needs. He didnt want to turn Luna, so why would he want to turn me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd would my life be any easier if I were with someone mortal? We could see each other by our lockers, share classes, and hang out at school dances. But I lived in Dullsville, where no mortal was like me. Even if Alexander hadnt moved into the Mansion on Benson Hill many months ago, I would never have found anyone here to love. I viewed my lonely, mortal world before I met Alexander as far more difficult than the challenges I faced by falling in love with a vampire. The insecurity of Alexanders and my future was better than the certainty of my unhappiness without Alexander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHooligans was a noisy, technology-driven themed restaurant. The food was normal faresalads, chicken wings, sandwichesbut the selling point was the jumbo-size, high-decibel, flashing-light video, pinball, and dancing games. Some games spit out tickets to use like cash to purchase prizes like bears, bracelets, and pencil toppers. It was quite easy to spend a hundred dollars just trying to win a twenty-cent prize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander thrived in his quiet hideaways, like the Mansion, Dullsvilles cemetery, and the Coffin Club, under the guise of Phoenix. I was concerned that Hooligans was going to blast him into sensory overload. However, I knew Sebastian would be in gaming heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian parked his Mustang in an empty space right next to Beckys truck. He wore a spectacularly stylish bloodred blazer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander glowedhis hair rich-looking, seductively dangling down, his lean body pressed into black jeans and a white T-shirt and finished with a sparkling oversized skull belt buckle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe arrived at the hostess stand to find a long line and at least a dozen patrons with pagers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell be here all night, Sebastian said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollow me. I forged through the sea of people and pushed myself right in front of the main hostess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWere meeting two friends. Im sure they already have a table, I said in my most mature voice, as my parents did when we were meeting their friends for dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can go ahead and check.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe squeezed our way through the waiting customersscreaming babies, young couples, and corporate parties. I was counting my blessings. So far no Trevor or a soccer snob in sight. I found Becky and Matt at a round table in the corner of the restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore any formal introductions could be made, Matt extended his hand to Alexanders best friend. Heyyou must be Sebastian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Sebastians focus was instead on Becky, and Alexander nudged his best friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, yeah. Nice to meet you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian made his way to the empty seat across from Becky, but I snuck in behind him and scooted myself into the chair just as he landed on my lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe looked quite the sightas if a ventriloquist had just sat on the dummy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeyget off of my girlfriend, Alexander teased, jabbing Sebastian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all laughed as Sebastian rose to find that the only empty chair was between Matt and Alexander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt and Sebastian found a common ground talking about computer games. However, in between breaths, Sebastian continued to be fixated on Becky, as if he was trying to seduce her with his gaze. Any normal guy could be a pest, but a vampire? He could be deadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held my menu out, blocking his line of sight, until the waiter finished taking our orders and the menus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can all use my points, Matt offered, showing us his Hooligans game card. Lets go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gaming area was packedfilled with couples dancing, skiing, shooting, and bowling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt took Beckys hand, Becky took mine, and I took Alexanders. Matt led us through the maze of people while Sebastian followed close behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt stopped in front of the only unoccupied gamea pinball machine, Nosferatus Nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWant to play? he asked, challenging Sebastian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure, Sebastian replied. Winner gets the girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat girl?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian gestured to Becky, who turned bone white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYoure joking! Matt said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course I am. But I knew Sebastian really didnt want to be. He appeared lovelorn for my best friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Matt and Sebastian played like they were competing for more than a high score on a pinball machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cozied up to Alexander. Are you having fun?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbsolutely!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWouldnt it be cool if Sebastian didnt leave? I asked. I was happy that Alexander had companionshipsomeone his own agein the Mansion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be awesome. Maybe we can convince him to stay a bit longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNosferatus Nightmare was a ghoulish 3-D game. Silver balls shot through winding tubes with neon bats running across them, and squeaky coffin lids opened and closed in attempts to catch the ball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpen Draculas coffinone thousand points, a monsteresque voice commanded as Sebastian hit the ball over a gravestone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky rested her head against Matt. Sebastian couldnt concentrate and lost the silver ball. He relinquished the controls to Matt and stood next to Becky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt pulled on the lever and clicked the flippers. A graphic of fangs clenched down on a womans neck flashed on the video screen along with the sound of a woman screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts not really like that, Sebastian said to Becky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt was just as naive as Becky. He, like she, was missing all the obvious signs that another guy had fallen for his girlfriend. And, most important, that the other guy was a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt scored a massive number of points and kept the ball in play like a professional gamer. Even Alexander was engrossed. Matt politely gave the controls to him. Heretry it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four of us watched as Alexander clicked the flippers as if hed been doing it his whole life. The ball hammered the bumpers, skyrocketing his score. He got multiball after multiball and racked up points in the millions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all cheered as Highest Bloody Scorer came across the screen and the machine lit up with blinking red and white lights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander seems to be in heaven, Becky said as we moved to another game. I think its great that his best friend is in town. I know its been good for Matt, too. Since he and Trevor stopped being friends, he does seem a bit lonely. Now he has two new ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo Jet Ski simulators opened just as we approached them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLets do this! I exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky and I each hopped on a machine. Matt gestured to Sebastian for him to ride along with Becky as Alexander sat behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian was tentative as he settled on the ski behind Becky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePut your arms around my waist, she said, lacing his hands around her. You dont want to fall off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt swiped the card before Sebastian could change his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly we were off, jetting over waves and avoiding wayward motorboats. I could almost feel the heat from the Miami sun, the ride felt so authentic. I peered back at Sebastian, who was hanging on to Becky for his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlow down! he said as if we were really tearing down choppy waters. Slow down!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky let go of her throttle as I passed her and a half dozen computer-generated opponents until we soared through the finish line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander and I hopped off our Jet Ski, while Sebastian still clung to Becky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts over, she said. But Sebastian didnt move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWant to do it again? Becky asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dont think so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeed some help? Matt asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of being thrilled by the ride and embracing his crush, Sebastian was green. Matt handed him a soda he had just bought. Here, drink this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the next several hours the five of us danced, boxed, and jousted our way through Hooligans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander and the gang hung back at the table while Becky and I counted and cashed in our skeeball earnings tickets. Becky and I each had enough tickets to win a stuffed bearBecky pointed to a sparkling teal blue one, and I spotted a shimmering black bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl handed the blue bear to Becky. Just as the cashier was about to take the black one, another worker grabbed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sneered. Hey, that was my bear!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIm sure its going to a nice kid, though, Becky said, trying to ease my disappointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then, we saw it was Trevor holding the black bear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKid, yesnice, no, I remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was our last one, the girl said. They werent very popular, so we stopped ordering them. We have tons of pink ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ought to rip it out of his hand, I told Becky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander, Sebastian, and Matt were mesmerized watching two men battle it out on Lazer Wars. I didnt want to bother Alexander with my swiped winnings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaggling over childrens toys, are we? Trevor said, sidling up to me. So is that Alexanders competition? I guess he hasnt heard of a brush before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didnt want this one, the Pradabee whimpered to Trevor, tugging on his Polo. I told you I wanted a pink one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pradabees voice was like black fingernails on a chalkboardand not in a good way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor glared at me and flung the black bear on the counter as his date retrieved a new plush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed the bear, which had landed on its back, and dusted it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYoure lucky youre going home with Raven, Becky said to the bear. The alternative would have been disaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt and Alexander were settling the bill while Becky, Sebastian, and I headed outside. Sebastian engaged Becky in conversation. He fawned over her in a genuine love-struck manner, complimenting her hair and comparing her beauty to that of a famous actress. She was so mesmerized by his attention, she didnt see a small row of bushes in front of her and tripped and fell onto the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian and I immediately rushed to her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIm okay, she said with an embarrassed laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you sure? I asked, picking up her bear and handing it to her. Who put that bush there, anyway? I joked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky wiped off a few leaves and raised up her skirt just above her knee to expose a small wound. There was blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shielded her knee and gazed up at Sebastian. He stood, frozen as if now he was the one in a trance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts nothing, Becky said. Then she noticed Sebastians odd behavior. Its just a scratch. I hope you arent the kind to faint around blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dont think hes going to faint, I said, watching Sebastian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you have a Band-Aid? she asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasnt sure what was in my Corpse Bride bag. I kept my gaze on Sebastian at the same time feeling my way through my purseI recognized a pen, lip gloss, mascara, and loose change. Finally, I pulled out a piece of paper. We can cover it with this. It was an old detention slip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThats not sterile. Do you mind checking with the hostess inside?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian was still fixated on Beckys wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIm not leaving you here. I tried to block her from Sebastians sight line. We need a tourniquet. Immediately. I took off my Olivia Outcast hoodie and attempted to tie it around her knee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRavenits hardly even a cut!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I knew it, Sebastian was crouched down next to Becky. He took her leg and placed her sandaled foot on his knee. Her pink toes sparkled against his black pants like tiny stars. It was like Prince Charming trying to fit the glass slipperonly this Prince Charming was a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky giggled awkwardly, her leg in Sebastians grasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIm all right, Becky said. Its just a scratch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian examined her wound as a jeweler would a diamond ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy are you two making such a fuss? Becky asked. Before I could do anything, Sebastian took his index finger and wiped her wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOoohthats gross! Becky screeched, closing her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDroplets hung on his finger like red wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fangs flashed. He reached his finger to his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew what he was about to do next, and though I wanted to see it for myselfa firsthand account of a vampire following his instinctsI knew if Becky saw it we could never undo the damage that would incur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis finger was about to pass his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! I exclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed Sebastian as hard as I could away from Becky, and the two of us tumbled to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRavenwhat are you doing? Becky asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian and I lay on the grass, for a moment disoriented. I regained my bearings and rose to my feet to find Sebastian already standing. His pale face was cherry red. I grabbed his hand and held it toward the light. The blood on his finger was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gazed at me with childish horror, like a toddler who has broken into a candy jar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky took out a crumbled tissue from her pocket and dabbed it on her wound. Then she showed me. See? The blood is gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander and Matt suddenly were standing behind us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhats going on? Matt asked, concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot Alexander a stern glare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing really. I tripped and skinned my knee, Becky said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian was very brave and wiped the blood off with his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt led Becky into her truck while Alexanders contentment slowly turned to anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexanders best friend was leaning against his car. A wicked grin overcame him as he licked his pale blue lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Sebastian drove toward my house, I tried to mask the severity of the situation by chatting about the upcoming weather forecast. I didnt want to snitch on Sebastianto condone or deny what had just taken placeif only not to spoil Alexanders evening. My boyfriend had been so happy to be out of the Mansion with his best friend by his sidea fellow vampire, a childhood playmate, his next-door neighbor. A guy with whom Alexander could be his true selfno longer having to wear the disguise of a rebellious mortal but instead that of a sensitive vampire. But Alexander was keen to Sebastians ill conduct. The two friends rode in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we finally parked in front of my house, Sebastian, along with Alexander and I, got out of the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander didnt bother to shut his door. He avoided Sebastian altogether and started for my driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian tapped his boot against his tire in disgust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didnt mean to do it, I defended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander chewed on his lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander Sebastian said bravely, confronting his best friend. I dont know what happened. Im truly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander faced his friend. You crossed the line, he said in a tone that couldnt hide his disappointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didnt plan on it. It wasnt like I hurt her. I couldnt help myself; Im not restrainedlike you, he said sincerely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou cant stay here, Alexander said firmly. His voice was strong, but it couldnt mask how it pained him to say it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIm sorry, Alexander. I wont go near her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky didnt see anything, I said. I wasnt sure why I was defending Sebastian. Perhaps it was because the hapless vampire, like me, seemed to get in trouble just by breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomorrow night, Alexander started, when you wake up, Jameson will have your things packed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian slunk back into the Mustang, and Alexander silently escorted me to my front steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIm sure he I began, but Alexander wasnt listening. Instead, he gave me a quick kiss on the lips. I opened the front door and reluctantly entered my house. I heard the sound of a car door slamming and a Mustang peeling away from the curb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI struggled as usual to sleep. The only time Id seen Alexander this upset was when we went to the SnowBall last winter and Trevor told him the only reason I liked him was that I thought he was a vampire. Instead of hanging out in bed, I sat on my desk and stared out my window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hoped Id find Alexander resting against our tree or sitting on the swings. All I saw was a lonely maple and an empty swing set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI replayed Sebastians obsession with Becky over in my mind. I imagined what would happen if Alexander and I were placed in a similar position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander was chasing me through the tombstones. The grass was wet with fresh rain, and the air filled with a gentle mist. I dodged a grave marker and then jumped over another as Alexander drew close. Fatigued yet exhilarated, I sprang over a third headstone. It caught the heel of my Mary Janes, I lost my balance, and I tumbled to the ground with a thud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a little stupefied. I sat up to find a sharp pain emanating from my right arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander leaped to my aide. I raised my elbow. He held it softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs it broken?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust bruised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blew off the dirt and gently picked the wet blades of grass from my skin and examined it closely. A large gash, the size of a pencil, raced up my forearm. We both watched as blood began to fill the slender wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are on sacred ground, I said, raising my wound toward his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo fangs pierced through the break in his lips. He tried to cover them with the back of his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou need me as much as I need you, I said, pulling his hand away. Its okay. You dont have to fight it anymore. You dont have to be strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see in his eyes that Alexander struggled, wondering what it would be like to finally taste my blood, as Sebastian had tasted Beckys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eId still have to bite you. To turn you, like me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps its time. Wed finally be together. Like Ive always wanted. Ive always needed you, Alexander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need you too, Raven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took my arm and drew it up to his mouth. He closed his eyes, and I watched as he licked his lips and opened his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, Nightmare jumped in front of the window and I was so startled, I was lucky I didnt fall off my desk and really bust my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted the reassurance that Alexander needed me just as much as I needed him. That he craved me, as Sebastian craved Becky. But I knew Alexander wasnt about to make that decision lightly. And did I want it, after all? Id put so much of my thought into this magical and darkened world when right before me I was seeing vampires struggle with their lifestyle, as I struggled with mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point, I could only imagine Alexander biting me and taking me into his world. The fantasy of it thrilled me. I could only hope the reality, should it ever show itself, would be as good. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/love-bites-vampire-kisses-7/page-7.html","bookId":1871,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:46:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:46:54 PM"}
