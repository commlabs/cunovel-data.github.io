The forty lush acres contained a large manor house, a workshop, stable and swimming pool. The state had bought the property in 1925 and had refitted the manor house to accommodate a hundred patients. A tall chain-link fence had been erected around the property, with a manned guard post at the entrance. Metal bars had been placed on all the windows, and one section of the house had been fortified as a security area to hold dangerous inmates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the office of Dr. Otto Lewison, head of the psychiatric clinic, a meeting was taking place. Dr. Gilbert Keller and Dr. Craig Poster were discussing a new patient who was about to arrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilbert Keller was a man in his forties, medium height, blond hair and intense gray eyes. He was a renowned expert on multiple personality disorder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtto Lewison, the superintendent of the Connecticut Psychiatric Hospital, was in his seventies, a neat, dapper little man with a full beard and pince-nez glasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Craig Foster had worked with Dr. Keller for years and was writing a book on multiple personality disorder. All were studying Ashley Patterson\u0027s records.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtto Lewison said, \"The lady has been busy. She\u0027s only twenty-eight and she\u0027s murdered five men.\" He glanced at the paper again. \"She also tried to murder her attorney.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone\u0027s fantasy,\" Gilbert Keller said dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtto Lewison said, \"We\u0027re going to keep her in security ward A until we can get a full evaluation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When is she arriving?\" Dr. Keller asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice of Dr. Lewison\u0027s secretary came over the intercom. \"Dr. Lewison, they\u0027re bringing Ashley Patterson in. Would you like to have them bring her into your office?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, please.\" Lewison looked up. \"Does that answer your question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trip had been a nightmare. At the end of her trial, Ashley Patterson had been taken back to her cell and held there for three days while arrangements were made to fly her back east.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA prison bus had driven her to the airport in Oakland, where a plane was waiting for her. It was a converted DC-6, part of the huge National Prisoner Transportation System run by the U.S. Marshals Service. There were twenty-four prisoners aboard, all manacled and shackled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley was wearing handcuffs, and when she sat down, her feet were shackled to the bottom of the seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy are they doing this to me? I\u0027m not a dangerous criminal. I\u0027m a normal woman. And a voice inside her said. Who murdered five innocent people?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe prisoners on the plane were hardened criminals, convicted of murder, rape, armed robbery and a dozen other crimes. They were on their way to top security prisons around the country. Ashley was the only woman on board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the convicts looked at her and grinned. \"Hi, baby. How would you like to come over and warm up my lap?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cool it,\" a guard warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey! Don\u0027t you have any romance in your soul? This bitch ain\u0027t going to get laid for - What\u0027s your sentence, baby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother convict said, \"Are you have any, honey? How about me movin\u0027 into the seat next to you and slippin\u0027 you - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother convict was staring at Ashley. \"Wait a minute!\" he said. \"That\u0027s the broad who killed five men and castrated them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all looking at Ashley now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the end of the badgering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the way to New York, the plane made two landings to discharge or pick up passengers. It was a long flight, the air was turbulent and by the time they landed at La Guardia Airport, Ashley was airsick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo uniformed police officers were waiting for her on the tarmac when the plane landed. She was unshackled from the plane seat and shackled again in die interior of a police van. She had never felt so humiliated. The fact that she felt so normal made it all the more unbearable. Did they think she was going to try to escape or murder someone? All that was over, in the past. Didn\u0027t they know that? She was sure it would never happen again. She wanted to be away from there. Anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometime during the long, dreary drive to Connecticut, she dozed off. She was awakened by a guard\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had reached the gates of the Connecticut Psychiatric Hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Ashley Patterson was ushered into Dr. Lewison\u0027s office, he said, \"Welcome to Connecticut Psychiatric Hospital, Miss Patterson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley stood there, pale and silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Lewison made the introductions and held out a chair. \"Sit down, please.\" He looked at the guard. \"Take off the handcuffs and shackles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe restraints were removed, and Ashley took a seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Foster said, \"I know this must be very difficult for you. We\u0027re going to do everything we can to make it as easy as possible. Our goal is to see that one day you will leave this place, cured.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley found her voice. \"How - how long could that -take?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtto Lewison said, \"It\u0027s too soon to answer that yet. If you can be cured, it could take five or six years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach word hit Ashley like a thunderbolt. \u0027\"If you can be cured, it could take five or six years....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The therapy is nonthreatening. It will consist of a combination of sessions with Dr. Keller - hypnotism, group therapy, art therapy. The important thing to remember is that we\u0027re not your enemies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilbert Keller was studying her face. \"We\u0027re here to help you, and we want you to help us do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing more to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtto Lewison nodded to the attendant, and he walked over to Ashley and took her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCraig Foster said, \"He\u0027ll take you to your quarters now. We\u0027ll talk again later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Ashley had left the room, Otto Lewison turned to Gilbert Keller. \"What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, there\u0027s one advantage. There are only two alters to work on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeller was trying to remember. \"What\u0027s the most we\u0027ve had?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Beltrand woman - ninety alters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley had not known what to expect, but somehow she had envisioned a dark, dreary prison. The Connecticut Psychiatric Hospital was more like a pleasant clubhouse - with metal bars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the attendant escorted Ashley through the long, cheerful corridors, Ashley watched the inmates freely walking back and forth. There were people of every age, and all of them seemed normal. Why are they here? Some of them smiled at her and said, \"Good morning,\" but Ashley was too bewildered to answer. Everything seemed surreal. She was in an insane asylum. Am I insane?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached a large steel door that closed off a part of the building. There was a male attendant behind the door. He pressed a red button and the huge door opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Ashley Patterson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second attendant said, \"Good morning, Miss Patterson.\" They made everything seem so normal. But nothing is normal anymore, Ashley thought. The world is upside down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This way. Miss Patterson.\" He walked her to another door and opened it. Ashley stepped inside. Instead of a cell, she was looking at a pleasant, medium-size room with pastel blue walls, a small couch and a comfortable-looking bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is where you\u0027ll be staying. They\u0027ll be bringing your things in a few minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley watched the guard leave and close the door behind him. This is where you\u0027ll be staying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began to feel claustrophobic. What if I don\u0027t want to stay? What if I want to get out of here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked over to the door. It was locked. Ashley sat down on the couch, trying to organize her thoughts. She tried to concentrate on the positive. We\u0027re going to try to cure you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re going to try to cure you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re going to cure you. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tell-me-your-dreams/page-22.html","bookId":2368,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:53 AM"}
