I sorted by restaurant, by dining time, by hometown, by recent travel, by airlines, but I couldn’t find any commonalities—other than everyone affected being here.” He sat down in his chair and breathed like someone with heart failure, his lungs searching for, but not finding, enough air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t look well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s no concern of yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside of the curtain’s Raluca’s megaphoned voice was getting quieter as it moved farther away. “You should get on the rescue ship—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just as captains go down with the ship, doctors should go down with their sickrooms.” He stirred the papers in front of him restlessly, seemingly more out of habit than need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI prepared to back out of the room to inspect the papers I’d swiped, but then I paused. “Where … is the captain?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isolated above. All the officers are quarantined off by floor—the ones upstairs are taking shifts manning the ship.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re sure?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re still on the radio with me. Luckily when the quarantine went in place, we had a good crew.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And all of them are still well? None of them is sick?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not last time I radioed, no. What are you getting at?” He didn’t sound angry, just exasperated and tired, and took another wet-sounding breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. I didn’t know, yet. But the utter destruction of an entire ship full of people was a tall order for any single man. Nathaniel must have had help, and it made sense for that help to be on the inside. And if Asher was right, he’d held the right patents to afford it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Haddad didn’t notice my distraction; he was too busy staring off behind me. I turned to see what he was looking at, and saw where the curtains had parted and a slice of the ocean was visible through the window outside. Shit. Him too. I stepped in front of the window, blocking his view, and knelt down to be in his field of vision. “I’m sorry, I lied to you earlier. I am pregnant, and I cannot have this baby alone. I need to find my husband. Do you have another master key?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes focused on me slowly. “I gave my last one to Raluca.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s Raluca going now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“First floor. Where the tender boats dock.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Which side of the ship? How can I get there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The freight elevator and down. It’ll be aft.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich the fuck way was aft? “Down by the morgue?” I guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” He tilted his head so that he could see past me to the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew what was coming for him, and I knew I didn’t know how to help. Should I do what he’d done to the others and tie him to the table bodily, or should I just leash him by his foot?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Before you go, can you get me a glass of water?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry—” I stepped away from him. “I’ve got to go.” If Raluca got on the medical ship, I’d lose my chance to snag her key. I closed the curtain so he couldn’t see out anymore. It felt like the only thing I could do. Then I ran into the Dolphin to follow the volunteers down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-SIX\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery jogging step jostled my arm in its socket, and the manifest papers I’d swiped and hidden chafed. The wait on the elevator seemed interminable. I paced in circles trying to figure out how I’d get Raluca—or Marius, as a distant runner-up—to give me a key. I couldn’t exactly go and get into a fistfight with anyone in my current state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe freight elevator doors opened, and I jogged down the hallway to the morgue—I knew I was going the right way from all the flower petals people moving bodies had tracked back to the elevator doorway. If I went past the morgue, hopefully I’d run into them—there was no way transferring so many people over would be a quick process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of gunfire stopped me in my tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to pretend I hadn’t heard it. I paused, trying to convince myself that it’d been some weird engine noise—but no, another staccato burst and panicked shouting, coming my way—fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout thinking, I ducked into the morgue. Who would look for survivors in here? And maybe I could get some answers. I tapped the nearest body with my shoe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shadows—what’s happening?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe body didn’t answer me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know you’re in there.” The sound of screaming stopped, but the gunfire didn’t. I looked furtively at the doors, and they burst open. I bit back a scream and dropped to the floor, before I saw that it was Rory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You!” he said, recognizing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on out there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked around the room, realizing where he was, and he froze, as still as all the other occupants. “Rory—get away from the window.” When he didn’t move, I ran for him and pulled him aside. “What’s happening?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked and shook his head and didn’t stop shaking it while he talked. “Why did I come here? Did I want to die with them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized his parents were in here. “No.” I grabbed his nearer shoulder with my good hand and looked frantically around the room. “Shadows—” It was too bright in here with the lights on but I knew there were pools of darkness inside each half-opened mouth. The sound of gunfire was getting closer. “I know you can hear me. Can you hide us from this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t see which corpse they were speaking from this time, but I heard their voice, gravelly and low. “Turn off the light and cover yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the nearing gunfire, there wasn’t much time. I grabbed up a sheet from the ground, stained with frozen everything, put Rory in the corner of the room where I could find him, and put the sheet around his shoulders like a cape. Then I raced back to swat the light switch down, and ran as carefully as I could in the dark back to his side. I pulled the sheet up over both us, like we were children hiding from monsters beneath our own bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere came the sound of scrabbling on the outside of the sheet, and then a weight pressing down around us, like when my cat Minnie joined me on the bed at night—if Minnie had had a hundred more legs and they all ended in claws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not him, not him, just you,” the Shadows said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kick him out,” a voice suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let him die,” said another one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Rory said. I clapped a hand over his mouth, and wrapped my slinged arm around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop scaring him!” I hissed. “Haven’t you fed enough?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never,” they whispered back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRory started to wrestle me, and whapped his head back, catching me in the eye. I let him go involuntarily. “What the—” he began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop it! They can’t hurt you!” It was a total lie, but the guns were getting closer, and it was too easy to imagine each short burst extinguishing a life. “Just calm down!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing atop the sheet curled up on us like an icy snake, and Rory’s breathing sounded like a runaway train in my ear. “Hold your breath,” I whispered just as the doors to the morgue swung open. I could see a flashlight beam swirl around the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not sure what the Shadows showed instead of us, but it worked—either that, or whoever held the flashlight didn’t want to spend long in a room where the occupants were clearly dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Clear!” said an unfamiliar male voice. The light from the hallway and the flashlight beam disappeared, and the sound of tromping continued on outside. The weight on top of us scrabbled off, melting away, and Rory and I were alone in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was that?” Rory whispered, his voice breaking in panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll explain in a bit, but I need to know what’s going on first. What happened with the rescue ship?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“C—can we turn on the light?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s probably not wise,” answered the Shadows from beneath us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shush. Please. Although thank you,” I told them, and then snapped my fingers for attention in front of Rory, even though I couldn’t see his face in the dark. “What went on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They—they—” it took him a moment to get himself under control, but then the words poured out like water. “The rescue ship sent a smaller boat over, and we opened the doors up for it to dock—and some of the people started trying to throw themselves overboard. Even the weak ones still wanted to get into the water. We tried to hold them back, but we couldn’t. They were too strong. One fell in, and we put a spotlight on him, but we couldn’t pull him out—he was too far away. And then this thing, I swear I saw this thing crawl out of his mouth, like a giant worm. The size of my arm.” He grabbed hold of me in the dark for strength. “I don’t have one of those inside of me, do I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course not,” I said—although I didn’t know for sure. “Where did the people with guns come from?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The medical boat. When their transfer boat docked, twenty men got off with guns. They were never here to help us, were they,” he said, not actually asking a question. “Is that what happened to my parents? Worms?” His voice broke at the thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t lie to him twice. “I honestly don’t know, Rory.” There wasn’t any time to comfort him, so I just pressed on. “Where’s Raluca?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She got shot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. I just saw her fall down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to grit my teeth to stop from groaning, and I spoke more slowly. “Focus, Rory. Where’d she fall?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Back by the boats. I was a faster runner.” I heard him swallow in the dark. “I just left her behind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s okay. Anyone would have done the same in your shoes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got scared,” he explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It happens. I know.” All the video games I’d imagined he’d played, all those times he’d seen people die on screen, but the real thing was something else. It always was. “Where’s Marius?” I asked gently. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/deadshifted-edie-spence-4/page-27.html","bookId":2621,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:56:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:56:23 PM"}
