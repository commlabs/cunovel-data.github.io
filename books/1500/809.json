However, soon afterwards, her sharp senses noticed that the expressions of the eyes that were looking at her were a bit strange. On the second day, the tavern’s elder found her, and then after a chat, Persephone learned the reason behind the townsmen’s strange change in attitude.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTurns out they already no longer welcomed her.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe method O’Brien used was extremely simple, all he did was tell the people of this town that Persephone was someone Bevulas insisted on capturing. As long as he knew she was here, the chairman’s army would come sooner or later. Before the chairman’s great army, all things would be crushed to ashes. As for the residents of Leeds who had previously sheltered her and associated with her, the chairman’s army definitely wouldn’t let them off easily. That was why for this small town, Persephone became the bringer of destruction.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThere was already no one who remembered that if it were not for Persephone, Leeds would have long been captured a month ago by armed mobs. There was also no one who remembered that nine out of the ten weapons they were holding were things she brought back from the wilderness, moreover sold to them at a cheap price. There might be some who still remembered, for example, the elder in the tavern, but compared to the entire town’s population, they only made up a very small percentage, not enough to represent or convince the others. All of them liked Persephone, but liking her wasn’t the same as fighting for her, or dying for her.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMeanwhile, after a night of contemplation, the few residents of the town who still felt guilty became quiet, thinking more from a rational perspective. If Persephone stayed behind, they were definitely going to die. If she leaves, the chairman might show pity and let them live. No hope versus a trace of life, it was just this simple of a choice, and most of them already had their answer.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePersephone didn’t blame them. Before a true threat of death, few people would choose not to think about themselves. That was why when she learned the whole story, Persephone packed her few possessions, tossed everything into the classic car’s trunk, and then prepared to leave at daylight the next morning.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs for where she was going, she didn’t think that far yet, nor did she want to.

While looking at this robust man who left her in quite the troublesome situation, at the time, Persephone said, “I have a man, and have a child as well.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eRuddick thought for a bit, and then said, “However, I accepted your payment, so I have to work for you for a period of time.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs a result, the pickup truck had three more people added to it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSmoke surged from the classic car as it drove into the distance. On the hill where Rudolph had previously stood, O’Brien lowered his binoculars, silently standing there. After some time had passed, Eileen silently appeared at his side. Just now, she was in the town, watching as Persephone left.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“That fella named Ruddick seems to have quite the courage.” O’Brien said.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eEileen coldly said, “There’s only a fine line separating courage and stupidity.

Look at this world, if there is a god, then he’s definitely blind.” Eileen spoke ruthlessly.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eO’Brien shook his head, and then said, “The priest indeed doesn’t have any abilities, but that doesn’t mean he is without wisdom. In reality, if he casts aside his religious coat, I believe that of all the people who I’ve ever met, he is one of the few wise men who understand the essence of this world.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“How can someone without abilities have wisdom?

O’Brien and Eileen were no longer as rigid and singular as when they first got together. Using Eileen’s words, it was that outside of the standard mating, they truly began to communicate with each other. O’Brien was quite learned, and even more so dipped into the arts and religion. In this era, these were subjects that were extremely rare. Meanwhile, Eileen saw all things from a different extreme, at times being overly realistic, cruel, and seeing things based on their utility. However, they couldn’t deny that serious discussions from different angles opened up both of their minds, understanding each other deeper from this. A more realistic comparison was that even though they were both Magic Domain ability users, their styles were entirely different. Eileen was more infatuated with berserk power and energy, while O’Brien favored meticulous control. The two paths continuously clashed, allowing both of them to travel even further along their magic paths.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe relationship between the two, thus began to quietly and quickly change. Traveling together through life and death really was the best smelting furnace. After fighting countless battles together, the two gradually became closer. This was one of the reasons why when they met again, Persephone didn’t sense the slightest bit of hostility from Eileen when they reunited this time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePerhaps the only crack between them was Eileen’s dedication towards producing a perfect offspring. Even now, there weren’t any posterity that were to her satisfaction. With her exceptionally powerful abilities, even if it was just a tiny fertilized ovum, she could still inspect whether or not there was a chance of giving birth to a perfect human who exceeded all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eTowards any posterity that weren’t perfect enough, Eileen would ruthlessly destroy them. Even though not even she knew what a perfect organism was like, it was enough for her to make a decision if she found any incomplete abilities.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-18-4\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-18-6\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/demon-hunter/book-6-chapter-18-5","bookId":1500,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:50:18 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:50:18 AM"}
