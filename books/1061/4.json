But to all their pleading she replied:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I shall have but one husband as I have but one soul.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n However, after five years of mourning she left off her long veil and her black robes so as not to spoil the happiness of those about her, and in order that all should smile and be free to enjoy themselves in her presence. Her duchy comprised a great extent of country; moorlands, overgrown by heather, covered the desolate expanse, lakes in which fishermen sometimes caught magic fish, and mountains which rose in fearful solitudes over subterraneous regions inhabited by dwarfs.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She governed Clarides with the help of an old monk who, having escaped from Constantinople and seen much violence and treachery, had but little faith in human goodness. He lived in a tower in the company of birds and books, and from this place he filled his position as counsellor by the aid of a number of little maxims. His rules were these: “Never revive a law once fallen into disuse; always accede to the demands of a people for fear of revolt, but accede as slowly as possible, because no sooner is one reform granted than the public demands another, and you can be turned out for acceding too quickly as well as for resisting too long.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Duchess let him have his own way, for she understood nothing about politics. She was compassionate and, as she was unable to respect all men, she pitied those who were unfortunate enough to be wicked. She helped the suffering in every possible way, visited the sick, comforted the widows, and took the poor orphans under her protection.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She educated her daughter Honey-Bee with a charming wisdom. Having brought the child up only to do good, she never denied her any pleasure.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This good woman kept the promise she had made to the poor Countess of Blanchelande. She was like a mother to George, and she made no difference between him and Honey-Bee. They grew up together, and George approved of Honey-Bee, though he thought her rather small. Once, when they were very little, he went up to her and asked:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Will you play with me?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I should like to,” said Honey-Bee.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We will make mud pies,” said George, which they proceeded to do. But as Honey-Bee made hers very badly, George struck her fingers with his spade. Whereupon Honey-Bee set up a most awful roar and the squire, Francoeur, who was strolling about in the garden, said to his young master:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It is not worthy of a Count of Blanchelande to strike young ladies, your lordship.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Whereupon George was seized with an ardent desire to hit Francoeur also with his spade. But as this presented insurmountable difficulties, he resigned himself to do what was easier, and that was to stand with his nose against the trunk of a big tree and weep torrents.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the meantime Honey-Bee took care to encourage her own tears by digging her fists into her eyes; and in her despair she rubbed her nose against the trunk of a neighbouring tree. When night came and softly covered the earth, Honey-Bee and George were still weeping, each in front of a tree. The Duchess of Clarides was obliged to come and take her daughter by one hand and George by the other, and lead them back to the castle. Their eyes were red and their noses were red and their cheeks shone. They sighed and sobbed enough to break one’s heart. But they ate a good supper, after which they were both put to bed. But as soon as the candle was blown out they re-appeared like two little ghosts in two little night-gowns, and they hugged each other and laughed at the top of their voices.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And thus began the love of Honey-Bee of Clarides and George of Blanchelande.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3033/83844.html","bookId":1061,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 7:34:53 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 7:34:53 AM"}
