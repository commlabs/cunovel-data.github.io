The saints were also the same. More and more saint martial artists arrived, wanting to see the proud and tall figure of Blacksalt as he laid forth his challenge atop Ash Blood Mountain. They all became increasingly excited, sending out constant cheers!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It’s been three days already.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn an open glade at the base of Ash Blood Mountain, seven or eight human martial artists were gathered together, drinking wine.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Things are such a depressing mess right now that people are blocking the doorways shouting.

The third ranked human junior Hang Chi had fought against the fifth ranked saint junior Blacksalt but still hadn’t been able to win.

He was not some nobody of his generation, but someone who had once also entered the finals of the human First Martial Meeting. It was hopeless for him to try to defeat Blacksalt, but his only desire was to leave some mark on Blacksalt’s body or chop down on him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Luqi, go and fight him.” Blacksalt said to a red-clothed woman.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn these past days, many young elites of the saint race also gathered here.

Without giving that brawny youth a chance to speak, the full moon sickle in her hands cut down at his neck.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe saint race martial artists focused on cultivating their mortal bodies. Many of them were like Blacksalt with a defensive ability that had reached the limit. But now, this red-clothed woman in front of them was actually the opposite. Her mortal body was extremely soft and flexible, like a piece of moldable dough.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe brawny youth had never encountered such an opponent before and was immediately struck into a disadvantage. In just a few moves, he was defeated. This was simply the massive gulf of strength that existed between them. On one side was an upper level Empyrean descendant, and on the other side was someone who just managed to reach the human First Martial Meeting finals.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Too weak!

Those that were a little stronger found it impossible to defeat Blacksalt, and those that were a bit weaker were directly defeated by Blacksalt’s followers.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThere were not many people that were willing to step on stage to fight if they knew the only result that awaited them was death.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe red-clothed woman was only casually mocking the humans and didn’t expect that anyone would actually come up. But, she never imagined that after that brawny youth had been beaten into a near death state and had to be carried away, there would actually be someone else that came on stage.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis person wore black clothes and carried a spear. His figure was slim and straight, as if he himself were a long spear, giving off a sharp and arrogant feeling.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe red-clothed woman chuckled. “To think there really is someone that wants to die. Since that’s the case, then let me help you along!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe red-clothed woman raised her sickle blade and slashed down!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut as she slashed out with her sickle, not too far behind her, Blacksalt actually frowned. He didn’t know why, but this black-clothed man was emitting an extremely dangerous feeling, setting off all his alarms…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis person is…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBlacksalt had grown up in wild and dangerous jungles since childhood. He could metamorphosize into a beast and he also had the natural intuition of a beast. Even though this black-clothed youth was casually standing there, not seeming special at all, Blacksalt could actually feel a terrifying aura exuding from his body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Luqi…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBlacksalt wanted to warn her, but at this moment the black-clothed youth moved. His figure accelerated to extreme velocities and the red spear in his hands thrust out!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAtop the spearpoint, the power of thunder and fire wove together, sending out a brilliant divine light!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith a thrust of this spear, the void collapsed, thunder and fire howled, and a flaming spear light hurtled forth like a red and purple flood dragon, roaring into the heavens!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBang!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith a loud banging sound, a coruscating light burst out, blinding to the eyes.

She spat out a mouthful of blood and was sent tumbling a thousand feet away.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBlacksalt’s figure flashed and he instantly appeared in the skies and caught Luqi. He immediately turned his head to look at the black-clothed youth, his eyes cold.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis sudden change caught everyone by surprise. Whether it was humans or saints, none of them could respond. No one expected for this sudden reversal to occur. This red-clothed woman was an upper Empyrean descendant, but she had been instantly defeated. This disparity was not tiny at all!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf someone could achieve this point, that person could only be a top six character of the human First Martial Meeting!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn other words, this youth on stage was someone that was in the top six of the human First Martial Meeting, moreover, his weapon was a spear.

They could withstand tremendous physical pain, they could withstand cultivating in loneliness, and they could even withstand the multi-faction plotting that occurred in mystic realms. But, when it came to defending the glory and dignity of their own race, their strength was far from what was imagined.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter being suppressed for so long, even they were feeling uncomfortable.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs for Lin Ming, he was a legend in the eyes of many young human elites.
