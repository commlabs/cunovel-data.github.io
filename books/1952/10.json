When she did respond, the words seemed to spew out. “Kristen isn’t doing this because she wants to help these kids. You realize that, don’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace raised her eyebrows. “She told you this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, no, but it’s obvious. She’s volunteering because she’s hoping for this Citizen Award that’s given out at graduation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivia had gotten the award the year they’d graduated. The Rotary Club gave it to a graduating senior with good marks who’d shown leadership skills and had a history of volunteering in the community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’d never get it with her grades,” Tanni said scornfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know this for a fact?” Grace asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanni hesitated. “Not for sure, but like I said, it’s obvious.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn’t appear all that obvious to Grace. “I think you’re making an assumption about Kristen that might be way off base.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It isn’t,” Tanni said without a hint of doubt. “She’s a cheerleader.” This was added in the most contemptuous tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t like cheerleaders?” Grace asked mildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hardly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was a cheerleader in high school,” Grace told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanni chanced a look in her direction. “But things were a whole lot different back then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made it sound like the days of the Wild West, when covered wagons roamed the prairie. “Oh? How’s that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know,” Tanni said with another shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, I don’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cheerleaders these days are real airheads. Kristen is, anyway. She’s got this laugh that makes me want to puke every time I hear it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace wondered what that was about. “Does she have a boyfriend?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanni lifted one shoulder. “I suppose so. They all do in that crowd.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you think I’m jealous, you’re wrong! I have a boyfriend, too. Shaw Wilson.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shaw who works at Mocha Mama’s?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He isn’t there anymore. He’s at art school in San Francisco. A friend of Will Jefferson’s helped him get in. It’s a really big deal that he was accepted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t know Shaw wanted to be an artist.” Grace was well aware that Tanni’s mother, Shirley Bliss, was both gifted and successful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s really talented,” Tanni said, her voice fervent with conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How wonderful that he has this opportunity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, but Grace could see that the girl missed her boyfriend. “I’ll bet you’re at loose ends without him around,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanni gave the same careless shrug, which wasn’t really a response. “I am. It’s one of the reasons I volunteered here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m glad you did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanni raised her eyes to meet Grace’s. “You mean you want me to stay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even if I don’t get along with Kristen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I’m hoping you’d be willing to cut her a little slack.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanni frowned. “How?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Drop the dirty looks and the sarcastic comments.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanni shuffled her feet back and forth. “I’ll try. The thing is,” she said wryly, “it comes sort of instinctively.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not saying you have to be friends, Tanni. All I’m asking is that you respect her and stop judging her motivations. So what if she volunteered because she’s going after the Rotary award? Her being here isn’t taking anything away from you, is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not really,” she reluctantly agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what I thought.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanni bent to grab her backpack. “Can I go now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course. Thanks for hearing me out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll be back next week?” Grace asked, following her to the office door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanni nodded. “I might not like Kristen, but I think Tyler and Boomer are cool.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel Peyton stopped at the dry cleaners to pick up her good jacket on the way home from Get Nailed. As she waited, a wave of dizziness nearly overwhelmed her and she quickly found a chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You okay?” Duck-Hwan Hyo asked, his eyes dark with concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel tried to reassure him. “Yes, yes, I’m fine,” she said, but her voice sounded shaky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have baby?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel nodded. Funny, the man at the dry cleaners had figured it out, but not her own husband. There were times Bruce could be so dense that she wanted to hit him over the head with her shoe. She longed to tell her husband; despite the fact that this pregnancy wasn’t planned, Rachel was excited about the baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuck called something in Korean to his wife. The petite woman came out from the back of the shop and joined her husband at the front counter. They had a brief conversation that involved several sympathetic glances at Rachel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want tea?” his wife, Su Jin, asked softly. “I make you cup of green tea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I’m okay, really.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You sure?” her husband asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure, Duck,” Rachel told him. “Thank you. I just got light-headed for a moment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I change my name,” Duck said with a polite bow of his head. “I not Duck anymore. I pick American name.” His face beamed with pride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I choose American name, too,” Su Jin announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My American name,” Duck said, squaring his shoulders, “is José.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“José,” Rachel repeated, and struggled not to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My American name,” his wife said next, “is Serenity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll remember both,” Rachel promised them. She collected her dry cleaning and went out to her car. Going to the cleaners had been a delaying tactic. Jolene would be home and there’d be the usual tension between them once Rachel entered the house. If anything, that tension had been escalating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJolene and Rachel used to be close; Rachel had been friend as well as surrogate mother to the girl. That changed when Rachel married her father. Then they’d gone from friends to adversaries. Jolene appeared to see Rachel as competition for her father’s affection. The groundwork of friendship Rachel had laid had given way like quicksand as soon as Bruce slid the wedding ring on her finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel was still shocked that her relationship with Jolene had disintegrated so fast. She’d done her utmost to be patient and understanding. At first, she’d tried to keep Bruce out of it; she didn’t want her husband caught in an impossible situation, forced to side with either his wife or his daughter. That hadn’t worked. Jolene’s antagonism had grown to the point of near-belligerence, and Rachel no longer knew what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pregnancy complicated everything. She’d warned Bruce that they needed to be more careful about protection when making love. She’d gone on the pill right away, but had a rare adverse reaction to it. So Bruce had said he’d take responsibility for birth control and he had—most of the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blamed Bruce; she blamed herself. When she’d realized that their occasional slips had resulted in pregnancy, Rachel had been stunned. She’d needed to adjust to it before she told Bruce, knowing he wouldn’t be able to keep the secret from Jolene for long. Based on recent experience, Rachel recognized that the situation, which was barely tolerable now, would only get worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe should be heading home and getting dinner started, but the thought of facing Jolene was more than she could bear, especially when she felt queasy, as she seemed to every afternoon. She suspected it was a combination of nausea caused by the pregnancy, worrying about Jolene’s reaction and the constant stress at home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn’t do it. Instead of driving home, she went to Teri’s place on Seaside Avenue. Rachel hadn’t been to see her friend in nearly a week. She turned into the long driveway and parked in front of the house with a feeling of reprieve—however temporary that reprieve might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than ring the doorbell for fear of waking the triplets, she tapped on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her surprise Bobby answered, a baby tucked in the crook of his arm. “Teri will be glad to see you,” he said, bouncing the baby as he spoke. This was a sight Rachel had never expected to see. Bobby, who was a world chess champion, holding an infant in his arms. It warmed her heart and helped her believe that the power of love could change things for the better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is this a bad time?” she asked, afraid she might’ve walked into the middle of a feeding. Those were always hectic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you kidding?” Teri asked, sweeping into the foyer. “I’m dying for company. Come on in and make yourself comfortable. Let me bring Jimmy here over to Nikki. I’ll be back in a minute.” Teri took the baby from her husband’s arms and briefly disappeared. When she returned, without little Jimmy, she flopped down on the sofa next to Rachel. Bobby, who’d been awkwardly trying to entertain Rachel with an account of some chess game or other, hurried off, his relief all too evident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You look exhausted,” Rachel told Teri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am,” Teri admitted. “We haven’t got the boys into a routine yet. Nikki’s helping me with it.” She sighed gustily. “I have no idea what I’d do without such a wonderful nanny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were lucky to find her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” Teri smiled, clasping her hands prayerfully. “I’m so grateful. Now…what about some tea?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d love it,” Rachel said. Ever since she’d declined the cup of tea Su Jin—or Serenity—had offered her, she’d been craving one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me, too. I haven’t had a chance to sit down all afternoon.” Despite looking worn out, Teri leaped back up and hurried into the kitchen, Rachel trailing behind her. “I hope you’re here to tell me Bruce knows you’re pregnant,” Teri said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel shook her head. “Not yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rach, you have to tell your husband.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel shrugged. “I agree. I just want to preserve what peace there is for as long as I can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can’t allow Jolene to run your life—which is exactly what’s happening now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then tell me how to change that and I’ll be happy to do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeri sat down at the kitchen table, and Rachel took the chair across from her. “Have you tried taking Jolene out, just the two of you?” Teri asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel nodded. “But she isn’t interested in going anywhere if I’m along.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought she liked to shop?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She does, but not if I’m with her.” Part of the problem was that Jolene preferred to be with kids her own age rather than an adult. Like almost every young teenager, she was far more influenced by her friends and their opinions than by her parents. Granted, she idolized her dad, but Rachel had become the evil stepmother. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/1022-evergreen-place-cedar-cove-10/page-10.html","bookId":1952,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:01 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:01 AM"}
