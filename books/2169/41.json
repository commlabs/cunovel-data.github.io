Everything seemed unimportant at that moment, save the two commemorative markers set in the garden of Chasewind Manor. One had been a gift from King Danube, a symbolic gesture as the man had reclaimed Chasewind Manor. The other had come from Brother Braumin and, surprisingly, from Brother Francis, to signify the support of the new Abellican Church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr was it still the Abellican Church? During the heated arguments, Brother Braumin had hinted that his group and any who would follow - and his opponent, Abbot Je\u0027howith, had recognized that the list of fol-lowers might be long - might splinter from the Abellican Church to begin the Church of Avelyn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They love us now,\" the woman said to the marker. It was only a marker, for Elbryan\u0027s body wasn\u0027t interred there. Pony would not allow it. Her hus-band was to be buried in the grove beyond Dundalis, the place where he had found the grave of his uncle Mather and where he had earned Tempest. To that end, Bradwarden and Roger were leaving Palmaris that very day, the centaur pulling a caisson carrying Elbryan\u0027s casket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePony could hardly believe he was gone. She stood there, very still, trying to replay the events that had brought her to this terrible place. But she could not fathom it all. Half her soul had been torn away, and now she was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey talked of making her the Mother Abbess, the leader of the Church. King Danube had promised her much, perhaps even the barony of Pal-maris, in honor of her service to the kingdom - for the defeat of Markwart was now being heralded as a victory for the Crown. At that moment, despite her desire to do good, Pony hoped that none of it would come true, that they would all just leave her alone with her memories and herpain. Perhaps she could be a great leader for the Church, perhaps take it in the direction Avelyn had espoused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hardly cared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor all she knew was emptiness and helplessness, a sense of unreality that this terrible thing could not have happened. When she thought back to the previous fall, pregnant in Caer Tinella, making love with Elbryan on the field, she nearly toppled over with weakness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gentle hand touched Pony\u0027s shoulder, and she turned to see Kalas, the interim baron of Palmaris, and Constance Pemblebury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going with them to the north?\" Constance asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tomorrow, perhaps,\" Pony answered noncommittally. \"Or if this busi-ness with the Church is not finished, then perhaps sometime later on.\" In truth, Pony did not want to go back to Dundalis, could not bear to watch Elbryan\u0027s casket be lowered into the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked solemnly, staring straight ahead and not at the crowds gath-ered along the roads, many throwing flowers at the caisson. Elbryan, Nightbird, was fast becoming legend to the folk of Palmaris, something that both Roger and Bradwarden welcomed cautiously. For though they knew their friend was worthy of any honor bestowed him, they wanted to remember the truth of the man, and didn\u0027t want that truth, impressive enough of its own accord, blurred by ridiculously exaggerated legend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis moment, Elbryan\u0027s moment, would live on in the memories of all who watched - and that audience included King Danube Brock Ursal himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA contingent of Allheart horsemen led the way, and would accompany the caisson all the way to Dundalis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey came through the northern gate of Palmaris to find many more folk, all the farmers of the northern fields. Then another onlooker reared and cried out; mighty Symphony on a hillock not far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He knows,\" Bradwarden assured Roger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if on cue, the great stallion charged down the hill to join them, can-tering past the Allheart soldiers, who sat in silent awe of the magnificent steed, stronger and swifter than even their famed To-gai-ru horses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSymphony pawed at the caisson, and Bradwarden, ever attuned to the desires of horses, pulled the harness from over his head and strapped it on the stallion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn they went, quietly to the north.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom far away, Belli\u0027mar Juraviel watched the procession, the last journey of his dear friend, then turned for home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnseen by the elf - though not so far away - Marcalo De\u0027Unnero watched, too. His physical wounds were nearly healed by the power of hishematite ring, but his emotional scars ran deeper. The monk - former monk, it would seem -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;came to question so many things as he watched the outpouring for Nightbird, as he secretly listened to the conversations of farmers, damning Markwart, praising the ranger, and speaking in hopeful terms of a great and miraculous change within the Abellican Church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDe\u0027Unnero could hardly believe the turn of events, but he had too many problems of his own to sit and ponder them. He had no idea of where his favored gemstone might be, had not seen it in weeks, and believed that it had somehow merged with his soul. For now he was man and beast, and though he could often willfully shift from one form to the other, or to something in between, there were other times, times of anger or when he smelled prey, that the urge to fall into the form of the tiger overwhelmed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pall settled over Andur\u0027Blough Inninness later that summer, when Belli\u0027mar Juraviel returned with news that Nightbird had fallen. Though the war had ended favorably, though Juraviel had returned to them, though the child of Nightbird and Pony was growing strong and healthy, the loss of Nightbird and Ni\u0027estiel weighed heavily on the small and intimate family of the Touel\u0027alfar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one real bright spot seemed to be the child, so full of smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuraviel and Lady Dasslerond went to the babe soon after Juraviel\u0027s re-turn, standing over it as it lay on the shining green grass, the Lady bending low to stroke his soft cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He will grow strong and special,\" Dasslerond remarked, \"will come to greatness beyond that of his father and his mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She lives,\" Juraviel replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDasslerond turned a firm stare on the elf. Of course she already knew about Pony, and knew, too, that Juraviel had only made the remark to hint that he believed that the child belonged with its mother. Lady Dasslerond would hear none of that, her stare reminded Juraviel. They had taken the babe as their protege, the child of Nightbird and not of Elbryan, the child of Andur\u0027Blough Inninness, and to the elven lady, the issue was settled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I aided them in their escape,\" Juraviel admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady Dasslerond gave a little laugh. \"Do you believe that I did not know you would do as much when I allowed you to return to them?\" she asked, putting her companion at ease. \"You chose well on this matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What of Jilseponie?\" Juraviel asked. \"She knowsbi\u0027nelle dasada. We cannot take that from her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady Dasslerond didn\u0027t seem concerned. \"Jilseponie was a fine com-panion to Nightbird,\" she replied. \"The woman will not betray him by sharing that which he taught her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuraviel hoped the lady was right, for he knew that Dasslerond would be watching the humans more closely for a long while, and that if Pony did begin to teach the sword dance, to King\u0027s soldiers or to monks, she would be taken prisoner by the Touel\u0027alfar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she was lucky, and if Dasslerond was feeling particularly compassionate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA giggle from below turned their attention to the babe. His crooked little grin resembled that of young Elbryan when he had first come to Andur\u0027 Blough Inninness, but the child showed the same bright blue sparkles in his eyes as his mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept when the elves left him alone, for then came a hint of a red fire behind those blue orbs, a trait inherited not from his mother nor his father, but planted within the child, within Pony\u0027s womb, by the demon dactyl during her first battle with Dalebert Markwart, the corporeal vessel of Bestesbulzibar. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-demon-apostle-the-demonwars-saga-3/page-41.html","bookId":2169,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:35:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:35:09 PM"}
