Go on, then.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Seems more likely she’s set herself against the Crippled God.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh yeah? What’s this Lether Empire got to do with the Crippled God?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A whole lot, that’s what.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Meaning me and Fiddler are back fighting the same damned war.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘As if you didn’t already know that, Hedge-and no, wipe that innocent look off your face. It’s not dark enough and you know that so that look is for me and it’s a damned lie so get rid of it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ouch, the wizard’s nerves are singing!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘This is why I liked you least of all, Hedge.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I remember once you being scared witless of a recruit named Sorry, because she was possessed by a god. And now here you are, working for that god. Amazing, how things can turn right round in ways you’d never expect nor even predict.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wizard stared long and hard at the sapper. Then he said, ‘Now hold on, Hedge.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You really think Sorry was there to get at the Empress, Quick? Some sordid plan for vengeance against Laseen? Why, that would be… insane.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What are you getting at?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Just wondering if you should be as sure of the ones you’re working for as you think you are. Because, and it only seems this way to me, all this confusion you’re feeling about the Adjunct might just be coming from some wrong-footed, uh, misapprehensions about the two gods crouching in your shadow.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Is all this just another one of your feelings?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I ain’t Fiddler.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, but you’ve been so close to him-in his damned shadow-you’re picking up all his uncanny, whispered suspicions, and don’t even try to deny it, Hedge. So now I better hear it straight from you. You and me, are we fighting on the same side, or not?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHedge grinned up at him. ‘Maybe not. But, just maybe, more than you know, wizard.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick Ben had selected out a half-dozen water-worn pebbles. Now he flung the rest away. ‘That answer was supposed to make me feel better?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How do you think I feel?’ Hedge demanded. ‘Been at your damned side, Quick, since Raraku! And I still don’t know who or even what you are!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What’s your point?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s this. I’m beginning to suspect that even Cotillion-and Shadowthrone-don’t know you half as well as they might think. Which is why they’re now keeping you close. And which is why, too, they maybe made sure you ended up without Kalam right there guarding your back.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If you’re right-about Kalam-there’s going to be trouble.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHedge shrugged. ‘All I’m saying is, maybe the plan was for Sorry to be right there, right now, beside Fiddler.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Adjunct didn’t even have an army then, Hedge. What you’re suggesting is impossible.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Depends on how much Kellanved and Dancer saw-and came to understand-when they left their empire and went in search of ascendancy.’ The sapper paused, then said, ‘They walked the paths of the Azath, didn’t they?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Almost no-one knows that, Hedge. You sure didn’t… before you died. Which brings us back to the path you ended up walking, after you’d gone and blown yourself up in Black Coral.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You mean, after I did my own ascending?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I already told you most of it. The Bridgeburners ascended. Blame some Spiritwalker.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And now there’s more of you damned fools wandering around. Hood take you all, Hedge, there were some real nasty people in the Bridgebumers. Brutal and vicious and outright evil-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Rubbish. And I’ll tell you a secret and maybe one day it’ll do you good, too. Dying humbles ya.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I don’t need any humbling, Hedge, which is fine since I don’t plan on dying any time soon.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Best stay light on your toes, then.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You guarding my back, Hedge?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I ain’t no Kalam, but aye, I am.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘For now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘For now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That will have to do, I suppose-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Mind you, only if you’re guarding mine, Quick.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Of course. Loyalty to the old squad and all that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So what are damned pebbles for? As if I couldn’t guess.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We’re heading into an ugly scrap, Hedge.’ He rounded on the sapper. ‘And listen, about those damned cussers-if you blow me into tiny pieces I will come back for you, Hedge. That’s a vow, sworn by every damned soul in me.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-373.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
