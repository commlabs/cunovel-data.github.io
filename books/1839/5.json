He’s a mean son of a bitch,” he added in a gratingly cheerful voice. “God help you then, MacBain. If Williams marries her, the men he’ll send will make Marshall seem as good and just as the day is long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe laird didn’t show any outward reaction to that bit of news. Nicholas rubbed the side of his head in an attempt to ease the sting before continuing on. “You’ll probably kill whoever he sends here,” he remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damned right I will,” MacBain snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But Williams will only retaliate by sending more . . . and more . . . and more. Can you afford to risk constant war with England? How many more Maclaurins will die before it’s settled? Look around you, MacBain. Marshall and his men damned near destroyed every building. The Maclaurins turned to you for help and made you their laird. They’re depending on you. If you marry Johanna, the land will legally become yours. King John will leave you alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your king approves of this union?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He does.” Nicholas’s voice was emphatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicholas shrugged. “I’m not certain. He wants Johanna out of England, that much I know. He made that remark several times. He seemed eager for the marriage and agreed to give you the Maclaurin land the day you wed. I’ll receive title to her holding in England.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” MacBain demanded again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicholas sighed. “I believe my sister understands why John wants her settled so far away—he calls this place the ends of the earth—but Johanna won’t tell me what his reasons might be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you would also profit from this marriage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want the holding in England.” he said. “It will only mean more taxes each year, and I already have enough to do rebuilding my own estates.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why did you ask for your sister’s . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicholas didn’t let him finish. “John understands greed,” he interrupted. “If he thought I was only protecting my sister from Baron Williams, he might have declined my suggestion to marry her to you. He did insist upon a large fine, of course, but I’ve already paid it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re contradicting yourself, Baron. If John wanted Johanna away from England, why would he consider marrying her to Baron Williams?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because Williams is extremely loyal to John. Williams is his lapdog. He would keep my sister under control.” Nicholas shook his head then. In a low whisper he said, “My sister was privy to some damning information, and John doesn’t want his past sins coming back to haunt him. Oh, she could never give testimony in court against any man, not even her king, for she is a woman and, therefore, would not be listened to by any official. Still, there are barons ready to rebel against the king. Johanna could possibly ignite their fervor if she told whatever it is she knows. It’s a puzzle, MacBain, but the more I reflect upon it, the more convinced I become that my king is actually afraid of what Johanna knows.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If what you guess is true, I’m surprised he hasn’t had her killed. Your king is capable of such a foul deed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicholas knew he would never gain MacBain’s cooperation unless he was completely honest with him. He nodded once again. “He is capable of murder. I was with Johanna when she received the summons to go to London. I saw her reaction. I believe she thought she was going to her execution.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yet she’s still alive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The king keeps her under close guard. She has private quarters and isn’t allowed guests. She’s living each day in fear. I want her away from England. Marrying you is my answer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe laird was pleased by the baron’s veracity. He motioned for him to walk with him and started toward the ruins he now called home. Nicholas fell into step beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacBain’s voice was low when he remarked, “So it was you who came up with this clever plan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Nicholas replied. “And just in the breath of time. John was set to marry her to Williams six months ago, but she was able to resist.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicholas grinned. “She demanded an annulment first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacBain’s surprise was evident. “Why would she ask for an annulment? Her husband’s dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was a clever stalling tactic,” Nicholas explained. “There was a witness to her husband’s death, but the body wasn’t recovered. My sister told the king she wouldn’t marry anyone as long as there was a shred of hope Raulf was still alive. He didn’t die in England, you see. He was in a city built on the water, acting as John’s envoy when the accident took place. The king wasn’t going to be denied, of course, but because he’s having so much difficulty with the church these days, he decided to go through proper channels. Johanna just received the papers. The annulment has been granted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who was this witness to her husband’s death?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do you ask?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just curious,” MacBain answered. “Do you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Nicholas answered. “Williams was the witness.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel stored that bit of information away in the back of his mind. “Why do you prefer me to the English baron?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Williams is a monster, and I cannot abide the thought of my sister being under his control. You were the lesser of two evils. I know you’ll treat her well . . . if she’ll have you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What nonsense is this? It isn’t her decision to make.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m afraid it is,” Nicholas said. “Johanna must meet you first and then decide. It was the best I could do. In truth, she wouldn’t marry anyone if she could continue to come up with the coins the king demands to stay unmarried. That is what she believes anyway. I know better. The king will marry her off one way or another.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your king is a greedy man,” MacBain said. “Or is this special punishment designed to gain your sister’s cooperation?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The tax?” Nicholas asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacBain nodded. “No,” Nicholas said. “John can force widows of his tenants in chief to remarry. If they’re determined to remain free or to choose their own husbands, well, then they have to pay him a sizable fine each year.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mentioned you already paid the fine. You’re assuming then that Johanna will find me acceptable?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicholas nodded. “My sister doesn’t know I paid the fine, and I would appreciate it if you didn’t mention it when you meet her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacBain clasped his hands behind his back and went inside. Nicholas followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I must consider this proposal of yours,” the laird announced. “The thought of marrying an Englishwoman is hard to stomach, and when you add the fact that she is also your sister, it’s almost unthinkable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicholas knew he was being insulted. He didn’t mind. The MacBain had proven his character during the battle against Marshall and his cohorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe laird might be a little rough around the edges, but he was also a courageous and honorable man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s something else you should consider before you decide,” Nicholas said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Johanna’s barren.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacBain nodded to let Nicholas know he’d heard him but didn’t comment on the news for several minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he shrugged. “I already have a son.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you mean Alex?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was told at least three men could be his father.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That is true,” MacBain countered. “His mother was a camp follower. She couldn’t name the man who fathered Alex. She believed it might be me. She died birthing the boy. I claim him as mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do any of the other men also claim him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Johanna can’t give you children. Will the fact that Alex is illegitimate matter in future?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It will not matter,” MacBain announced, his voice hard and unbending. “I’m also illegitimate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicholas laughed. “Do you mean that, when I called you bastard in the heat of battle against Marshall, I wasn’t being insulting but truthful?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacBain nodded. “I’ve killed others for calling me that name, Nicholas. Count yourself fortunate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll be the fortunate one if Johanna decides to marry you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacBain shook his head. “I want what rightfully belongs to me. If getting the land means marrying the shrew, I’ll do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would you believe she’s a shrew?” Nicholas asked, puzzled by MacBain’s conclusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve given me sufficient clues to her character,” MacBain answered. “She’s obviously a stubborn woman because she refused to confide in her brother when asked what information she has against her own king. She needs a man who will control her—those were your words to me, Nicholas, so don’t look so surprised—and last, she happens to be barren. She sounds appealing, doesn’t she?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye, she is appealing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacBain scoffed. “I don’t relish my future as her husband, but you are correct, I will treat her kindly. I imagine we’ll find a way to stay out of each other’s paths.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe laird poured wine into two silver goblets and handed one to Nicholas. Each raised his drink in a salute and then downed the contents. Nicholas understood proper etiquette in the Highlands. He promptly belched. MacBain nodded approval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suppose this means you’ll be coming back here whenever the mood strikes you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicholas laughed. MacBain sounded damned forlorn over the possibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll need several plaids to take back with me,” he said then. “You wouldn’t want anything to happen to your bride, would you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll give you more than a few, Nicholas,” MacBain countered. “I want at least thirty men riding escort. Each will wear my colors for protection. You’ll dismiss them when you reach Rush Creek. Only you and your sister will be allowed on our land. Is that understood?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was jesting about the plaids, laird. I can take care of my sister.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll do as I order,” MacBain commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicholas gave in. The laird changed the topic then. “How long was Johanna married?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A little over three years. Johanna would like to remain unmarried,” Nicholas said. “But my sister’s feelings are of no concern to John. He’s kept her under lock and key in London. I’ve only been allowed a short visitation, and John was present all the while. As I told you earlier, my sister’s a loose end he wants taken care of, MacBain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacBain frowned. Nicholas suddenly smiled. “How does it rub knowing you’re the answer to King John’s prayer?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe laird wasn’t amused. “I get the land,” he remarked. “That is all that matters.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicholas’s attention was turned when MacBain’s giant wolfhound came loping through the entrance. The beast was a fierce-looking thing with a brindle-colored coat and dark eyes. Nicholas thought it weighed almost as much as he did. The hound spotted Nicholas when he rounded the corner and bounded down the steps. He let out a low, menacing growl that made Nicholas’s hair stand on end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacBain snapped a command in Gaelic. His monstrous pet immediately went to his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A word of advice, MacBain. Hide that ugly gargoyle when I bring Johanna here. She’ll take one look at the two of you and turn right around and go back to England.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacBain laughed. “Mark my words. Nicholas. I won’t be denied. She will have me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won’t have him, Nicholas. You must be out of your mind if you think I would even consider becoming his wife.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Appearances are deceiving, Johanna,” her brother countered. “Wait until we’re closer. You’ll surely notice the kindness in his eyes. MacBain will treat you well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. Her hands were shaking so violently she almost dropped the reins to her mount. She tightened her hold on the leather straps and tried not to gape at the huge warrior . . . and the monstrous-looking animal leaning against his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were nearing the courtyard of the desolate holding. The laird stood on the step leading up to the dilapidated keep. He didn’t look particularly pleased by the sight of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was sickened by the sight of him. She took a deep breath in an attempt to calm herself, then whispered, “What color are his eyes, Nicholas?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brother didn’t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You saw kindness in his eyes, yet you didn’t notice the color?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had him there and they both knew it. “Men don’t notice such insignificant things,” he defended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You told me he was a gentle man with a soft voice and a quick smile. He isn’t smiling now, is he, Nicholas?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, Johanna . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You lied to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did not lie to you,” he argued. “MacBain saved my life not once but twice during the battle against Marshall and his men, and he refuses to even acknowledge it. He’s a proud man but honorable. You must trust me on this. I wouldn’t suggest you marry him unless I was convinced it would be a sound union.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohanna didn’t answer him. Panic was taking hold. Her gaze kept going back and forth between the huge warrior and the ugly beast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicholas thought she was getting ready to faint. His mind raced for some clever thing to say to help her calm down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“MacBain’s the one on the left, Johanna.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn’t amused by his jest. “He’s a very big man, isn’t he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brother reached over to pat her hand. “He’s no bigger than I am,” he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed his hand away. She didn’t want his comfort. She didn’t want him to feel her trembling with cowardly fear either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Most wives would wish to have strong husbands to defend them. MacBain’s size should be a comfort to you and a mark in his favor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. “ ’Tis a mark against him,” she announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued to stare at the laird. He seemed to be growing right before her eyes. The closer she got, the larger he became.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s handsome.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blurted out her opinion in a voice that sounded like an accusation. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/saving-grace/page-5.html","bookId":1839,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:03 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:03 AM"}
