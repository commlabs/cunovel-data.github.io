No more, in my opinion, than if I should seek to purchase hares or boar’s flesh or fatted capons. Or is there something mysterious in fish and fish alone, hidden from all save sorcerers only? If you know what it is, clearly you are a magician. If you do not know, you must confess that you are bringing an accusation of the nature of which you are entirely ignorant. To think that you should be so ignorant not only of all literature, but even of popular tales, that you cannot even invent charges that will have some show of plausibility! For of what use for the kindling of love is an unfeeling chilly creature like a fish, or indeed anything else drawn from the sea, unless indeed you propose to bring forward in support of your lie the legend that Venus was born from the sea?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI beg you to listen to me, Tannonius Pudens, that you may learn the extent of the ignorance which you have shown by accepting the possession of a fish as a proof of sorcery. If you had read your Vergil, you would certainly have known that very different things are sought for this purpose. He, as far as I recollect, mentions soft garlands and rich herbs and male incense and threads of diverse hues, and, in addition to these, brittle laurel, clay to be hardened, and wax to be melted in the fire. There are also the objects mentioned by him in a more serious poem.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRank herbs are sought, with milky venom dark\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eby brazen sickles under moonlight mown;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003esought also is that wondrous talisman,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003etorn from the forehead of the foal at birth\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eere yet its dam could snatch it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut you who take such exception to fish attribute far different instruments to magicians, charms not to be torn from new-born foreheads, but to be cut from scaly backs; not to be plucked from the fields of earth, but to be drawn up from the deep fields of ocean; not to be mowed with sickles, but to be caught on hooks. Finally, when he is speaking of the black art, Vergil mentions poison, you produce an entree; he mentions herbs and young shoots, you talk of scales and bones; he crops the meadow, you search the waves.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI would also have quoted for your benefit similar passages from Theocritus with many others from Homer and Orpheus, from the comic and tragic poets and from the historians, had I not noticed ere now that you were unable to read Pudentilla’s letter which was written in Greek. I will, therefore, do no more than cite one Latin poet. Those who have read Laevius will recognize the lines.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLove-charms the warlocks seek through all the world:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe ‘lover’s knot’ they try, the magic wheel,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eribbons and nails and roots and herbs and shoots,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ethe two-tailed lizard that draws on to love,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eand eke the charm tbat gods the whinnying mare.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/638/1083.html","bookId":274,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:25:06 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:25:06 AM"}
