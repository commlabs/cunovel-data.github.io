The glow from the tip of the stalactite gradually became more intense. As the glow surged, a drop of creamy liquid, that was like a spot of light, suddenly agglomerated and formed. This drop of liquid swayed at the tip of the stalactite. Finally, it left the stalactite and fell through the air before gently smashing into the notch at the top of the green rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe liquid from the stalactite came smashing down, causing the surface of the creamy white liquid, which was merely two inches deep to form a ripple. However, not a single drop of liquid splashed out...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan eyed the cream liquid that was fluctuating within the small dark-green bowl-like notch. He suddenly came to an understanding. This notch on the green rock was actually carved out by the dripping stalactites liquid. Xiao Yan’s hand rubbed the green rock and felt its firmness before sighing once again. Just how much time was needed in order to carve such a notch into the green rock by just relying on the strength of the dripping water? This was really the case of water penetrating rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I remember correctly, this liquid seems to require around a year before it can a drop of it forms. I wonder just how many years it takes before this small hole can be filled.” Yao Lao softly sighed at the side as he spoke. With his experience, he could not help but exhale emotionally at this moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan immediately came to a sudden understanding after hearing this. One year for a drop. It was really unexpected that the humble drop of liquid earlier had actually agglomerated a year’s worth of pure energy. Nature was indeed incomparably mysterious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Teacher, this should be the ‘Core Quenching Body Milk,’ right?” Xiao Yan’s eyes directly stared at the liquid in the notch as he laughed and asked a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” Yao Lao carelessly glanced at the liquid that was emitting a strange white fog and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan no longer hesitated when he saw that even Yao Lao had nodded. He swiftly took out a jade bottle from his storage ring and poured the ‘Core Quenching Body Milk’ into it. When Yao Lao’s voice suddenly sounded by his side, however, it caused him to be stunned as he stopped the actions of his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“These things may also be valuable, but it is not the main object. There is an even rarer unique treasure in this place.” Yao Lao placed both his hands behind him as he spoke with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is something even rarer?” Xiao Yan was stunned. His face was at a complete loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If an ordinary person were to see the ‘Core Quenching Body Milk,’ it is likely that they would be just like you, thinking that this dripping thing is the essence. However, they do not know that they have discarded the greatest treasure.” Yao Lao said in a teasing manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan smiled in embarrassment without being able to refute his claim. He really thought that the cream-colored liquid within the notch was already the rarest thing, not thinking that there was another thing that was a greater treasure than this ‘Core Quenching Body Milk.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Follow me.” Yao Lao lifted his head and eyed the enormous stalactite that hung from the mountain dome. Suddenly, he waved his hand at Xiao Yan before his body immediately drifted slowly up to the enormous stalactite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan was startled when he saw Yao Lao’s action. He hurriedly summoned the Purple Cloud Wings once again and carefully followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two people followed the enormous vertical stalactite and flew up for a couple of hundred meters. A few minutes later, they actually flew to the top of the mountain dome. Looking down from this spot, the stalagmites down below, which appeared quite large earlier, were the size of mere ants at this moment. As their gazes moved in all directions, they were able to see some of the stalactites that hung on the mountain dome in all directions. The pale glow brought light to the entire world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYao Lao ignored the surrounding stalactites. Instead, his floating body stopped at the end of this largest stalactite. At that spot, there was a faint fluorescent light seeping out from the stalactite, shining on the stalactite until it was like a transparent crystal, giving it an extremely beautiful appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan also flapped his wings and came to this place. He saw Yao Lao’s gaze and followed it. However, he did not discover any place where something was wrong. His mouth muttered a couple of times, but did not say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have a piece of jade? Use a piece of jade to gently dig into this spot. Remember, do not use any great force. Otherwise, you will completely destroy this stalactite that can only be formed after ten thousand years.” Yao Lao waved his finger at the empty space before the stalactite. A palm-sized circular trace appeared at the end of the stalactite. He observed this mark for awhile before turning his head toward Xiao Yan and spoke in a serious manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Xiao Yan’s heart was filled with doubt after hearing this, he still nodded his head. He took out a green-colored jade piece from his storage ring and used Dou Qi to carefully wrap its surface. After which, he gently followed the circular mark that Yao Lao’s finger had drew over the end of the stalactite and cut into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jade piece became extremely sharp as it was wrapped by Dou Qi. After a mere gentle touch, the sharp edge of the jade piece was inserted into the interior of the crystal-like stalactite after emitting a very soft ‘pu chi’ sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan held the jade piece tightly with his hand, not daring to allow it to even tremble a little. The jade piece followed the mark that Yao Lao had drawn without any mistake as it slowly moved. A soft ‘chi chi’ sound repeatedly reverberated in the quite high area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Crack…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jade piece in his hand completely parted the distance of one circle. Suddenly, a circular fragment of the stalactite fell down from its original body. Xiao Yan’s eyes and hands were quick as he grabbed it. When he lifted his head to take a look, a powerful and sudden light shot out from the fragment. The piercing glow caused him to hurriedly shut his eyes. The wings on his back swiftly flapped as a reflex action as his body withdrew for dozens of meters before coming to a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ke ke, everything’s fine. There is no need to worry.” Yao Lao’s laugh sounded by his side when Xiao Yan opened his eyes. Only then did his tense heart relaxed. He lifted his head to eye the spot where the intense light shot out before knitting his brows together and flying closer once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he came closer to this large stalactite, Xiao Yan’s gaze eyed the circular hole he had cut, only to be shocked to discover that there was actually a cluster of emerald-colored sticky liquid suspended within the stalactite. This cluster of liquid appeared as though it had some intelligence. The liquid flowed slowly within the stalactite but the region which it flowed in was coincidentally only within the area where the circular opening was. It ultimately did not even exceed where the line was or spill out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Xiao Yan was not exactly certain what this emerald-like viscous liquid was, the pure energy that it contained caused Xiao Yan to be shocked. This kind of pure energy was at least ten times richer than that of the ‘Core Quenching Body Milk.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is this?” Xiao Yan swallowed his saliva while feeling a dryness in his throat. His eyes were boiling hot as he eyed the cluster of emerald-colored sticky liquid while opening his mouth to inquire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is the true ‘Core Quenching Body Milk.’” Yao Lao smiled and slowly spoke when he saw the shocked manner of Xiao Yan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The liquid below is not?” Xiao Yan was startled as he asked in disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The liquid below is also the ‘Core Quenching Body Milk’...However, those are things that have flowed out from this original body. They are similar to a diluted ‘Core Quenching Body Milk’. There are some people in the continent who know about the matter of the ‘Core Quenching Body Milk,’ but there are very few people who know that the true ‘Core Quenching Body Milk’ is hidden at the point where the stalactite contacts the earth.” Yao Lao pointed at the green rock below and smiled as he explained, “This is perhaps also a kind of camouflage that the natural spirit object used to protect itself. An ordinary person would likely act just like you did just now when they found it. They would take away the ‘Core Quenching Body Milk’ below but end up leaving behind the true treasure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan involuntarily quietly smacked his mouth when he heard Yao Lao’s explanation. It was really unexpected that there were two different types a real one and a fake one when it came to this ‘Core Quenching Body Milk.’ There was really all sorts of strange things in this vast world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This true ‘Core Quenching Body Milk’ is extremely weak. Only the gentlest jade tools will not damage it. If a metal tool or other objects were used, this cluster of ‘Core Quenching Body Milk’ which has been agglomerating for an unknown number of years might immediately transform into a completely useless waste of liquid with just a single touch of those kind of tools.” Yao Lao reminded seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan stammered as he nodded. He rubbed the cold sweat on his forehead while quietly rejoicing. It was fortunate that he had the encyclopedia-like Yao Lao following by his side. Otherwise, if he were to rely on himself, forget about the issue of finding the true ‘Core Quenching Body Milk,’ even if he did luckily find it, it was likely that he would end up empty-handed because of his recklessness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What should we do now?” Xiao Yan eyed the viscous emerald liquid slowly flowing within the stalactite. He did not dare perform any actions by himself, and could only ask while facing Yao Lao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Use jade tools to get it out. Remember. Do not use your hand to touch it.” Yao Lao said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan hurriedly nodded when he heard this. He flipped and churned the interior of his storage ring for a long while before finally finding a jade spoon. As an alchemist, jade was the best container to store pills. Therefore, there were all sorts of jade utensils placed within his storage ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan carefully inserted the spoon into the stalactite. He agilely turned his wrist. After a couple of insertions and withdrawals, a large half of the ‘Core Quenching Body Milk’ was scooped up. Just as he was preparing to take away all of the emerald liquid, however, Yao Lao suddenly said, “Always leave something behind. This is an unwritten rule within the alchemist world. One cannot break the root when one finds a natural treasure. It is extremely difficult for this ‘Core Quenching Body Milk’ to be formed. If you were to take all of it away, it is likely that this stalactite, which took over ten thousand years to form, will gradually crack. Therefore, leave a little to keep it alive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan was slightly startled. He was somewhat ashamed as he nodded. Back then, when he was obtaining the ‘Green Lotus Core Flame,’ Yao Lao had also said this. His own actions were indeed a little too greedy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan pulled out his jade spoon after leaving a little ‘Core Quenching Body Milk’ behind. After which, he once again inserted the fragment of the stalactite in his hand back to where it came from. Immediately, the intense light gradually diminished and the stalactite once again returned to its calm manner earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan poured the emerald liquid in the jade spoon into a jade bottle of extremely good quality that he had already prepared. When he saw that the liquid was still flowing automatically as though it was a living being, Xiao Yan finally heaved a long sigh of relief. After much hard work, this thing was finally in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-515\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-517\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-516","bookId":1497,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:53 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:53 AM"}
