Reef pulled Perry aside in the darkened clearing. Lamps were lit around them, swinging gently in a cool ocean breeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Twenty-seven men and eleven women,” he said. “Ten Seers and five Auds among them, and you know about Kirra. Every one of them can handle a weapon, as far as I can tell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry had suspected the same thing. “You worried?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReef shook his head. “No. But just the same, I’ll stay back tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry nodded, trusting Reef to keep an eye on the newcomers. He almost ran Molly over as he turned to go. Marron had fallen ill, she told him. Nothing more than indigestion, but he’d be resting for the night. With Reef and Marron out, he’d be meeting with Kirra alone. Perry crossed the clearing to his house, not sure why that made him nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA short while later, she knocked on his door and stepped inside. Perry rose from the chair by the fire. Kirra froze and scanned the empty room. She seemed surprised that no one else was there. “I gave my people the night to themselves. It’s been a long journey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry moved to the table and poured two cups of Luster, handing one to her. “They’ve earned their rest, I’m sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking the drink, Kirra sat across the table, her eyes smiling as she watched him. She wore a tight shirt the color of wheat, the neck unbuttoned lower than it had been during supper. “We showed up at the right time,” she said. “Your tribe was hungry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They were,” Perry agreed. He couldn’t deny that their situation was dire, but he didn’t like it being pointed out by a stranger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When will you return to Rim?” he asked. He wanted to send a message to his sister. How was Liv? He had to know that she was all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirra laughed. “You want to see me go already? I’m hurt,” she said with a small pout. “Sable wants me to stay. We’re here to help out as long as you need us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat caught him off guard. He took a drink, giving himself a moment to recover as Luster warmed his throat. Sable was rumored to be ruthless, and this wasn’t a time for generosity. Had Liv pressed him for more aid? He wouldn’t put it past his sister. Liv could be ruthless too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry set down his cup. “Sable might want you to stay, but he doesn’t make decisions around here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course not,” Kirra said, “but I don’t see why it’s a problem. We brought our own food, and you have plenty of room to board us. Sable is your brother now. Consider our help a gift from him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gift? Help? Perry’s grip tightened on the cup. “Sable’s not my brother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirra took a sip of Luster, amusement glinting in her eyes. “I can imagine why you wouldn’t feel so, having never met him. Regardless, the advantage should be clear to you. I have the strongest fighters you can find, and my horses are trained to hold steady during storms and raids. We could help protect the compound for you. You won’t have to retreat to a cave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d heard. Though it was his choice and the best thing for the Tides, shame crept over him, heating his face. Kirra leaned forward and breathed in deeply, her gaze fixed on him. Her eyes were the color of amber—the same fiery color he scented in her temper. She was reading him, just as he was reading her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve heard about you,” she said. “They say you broke into the Dweller Pod and that you defeated a tribe of Croven. They say you’re twice Marked—a Seer, but you see in the dark.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Talkative, whoever they are. In all this chatter you’ve been hearing, has anyone mentioned the Still Blue? Has my brother Sable told you where it is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The land of sunshine and butterflies?” she said, sitting back again. “Don’t tell me you’re looking for it too. It’s a fool’s hope.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you calling me a fool, Kirra?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. It was the first time he’d called her by name. Because she noticed, he did too. “A hopeful fool.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry smirked. “The worst kind.” He was starting to wonder if everything she said would streak him. “You don’t think the Still Blue exists? Don’t you have any desire to live?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am living,” she said. “I won’t be chased by the sky.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey fell silent, watching each other. Her scent bristled with excitement. She didn’t look away, and he realized he couldn’t either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re in a vulnerable position,” she said, finally. “There’s nothing wrong with accepting a little help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelp. That word again. He was done. He couldn’t hear it one more time. “I’ll consider the offer,” he said, standing. “Is there anything else?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKirra blinked up at him. “Do you want there to be?” Her meaning couldn’t have been any clearer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry went to the door and opened it, letting in the night air. “Good night, Kirra.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rose to her feet and walked over. Stopping less than a foot in front of him, she stared into his eyes as she inhaled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry’s stomach clenched. She’d stirred his pulse, something he hadn’t felt in weeks. She’d know, but there was nothing he could do to hide it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sleep well, Peregrine of the Tides,” she said, and then slipped out into the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e26\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eARIA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are you doing here, Liv?” Aria asked, stepping into her room. She couldn’t keep the anger from her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiv rose from the bed. “I was looking for Roar. He wasn’t in his room.” The Greek dress looked rumpled now, falling off her shoulder, and she’d taken her hair down, but she looked stronger and more at ease than she had during dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria crossed her arms. A lamp flickered by the bedside, lighting the chilly, cramped room. “He’s not here. As you can clearly see.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just give him a message for me—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not telling him anything for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiv smirked. “Exactly who are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A friend of Roar’s and Perry’s.” Aria bit the inside of her lip as soon as the words left her mouth. Friend felt like such a weak way to describe herself. She was much more than that—to both of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile spread across Liv’s face. “Ahh … you’re a friend of Perry’s. I should’ve guessed. You look like someone my brother would be friends with.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Time for you to leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiv gave a small laugh, making no move to go. “Does that surprise you? You can’t really think you’re the only girl who’s fallen for him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria felt her face heat with anger. “I know I’m the only girl he’s rendered to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiv went perfectly still. Then she stepped close, her eyes boring into Aria. The welt from earlier disappeared against the redness of her cheeks. “I will kill you if you hurt him,” she said, her voice calm, unemotional. It wasn’t a threat. It was information. A consequence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was thinking that same thing earlier.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t know anything,” Liv said. “Tell Roar he has to leave. Right away. Before the wedding. He can’t stay here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How can you act like he’s an inconvenience?” Aria spat, thinking of all the nights she’d spent talking with Roar about Liv. Hearing how wonderful she was. This girl was horrible. Selfish. Rude. “You ran off! You left him! He’s been looking for you for a year.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiv waved a hand, gesturing around the room. “Do you think I chose this? Do you think I want to be here? My brother sold me! Vale took away everything I wanted.” She glanced at the door, staring at it like she was deciding something, and then stepped closer. “You want to know what I’ve done for the past year? I worked every day at forgetting Roar. I shut out every smile, every kiss, every stupid, perfect thing he ever said to make me laugh. I buried all of it. It took me a year to stop thinking about him. A year to stop missing him enough to come here and face Sable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Roar is ruining everything by being here,” Liv continued. “I’m not strong enough. How can I forget him when he’s right in front of me? How can I marry Sable if all I’m thinking about is Roar?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears brimmed in Liv’s eyes, and she breathed raggedly. Aria didn’t want to feel sympathy for her. Not when she’d hurt Roar as much as she had. “He’s here to bring you back, Liv. There has to be a way you can come back to the Tides.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go back?” Liv said with a thin laugh. “Perry can’t repay the dowry. And I can’t run away from this any longer. I know what it’s like out there. I know the Tides need help, and Sable can give it. He’ll keep helping if we marry. How can I walk away from that? How can I leave if it means my family could starve—or die?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria shook her head. She didn’t know. She let out a breath and sat on the bed as a sudden wave of exhaustion swept over her. Aether flashed through the small window, making the room flicker softly with blue light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiv’s problem felt uncomfortably familiar. Aria had been so focused on finding the Still Blue for Hess and on getting Talon back that she hadn’t let herself think about what would happen afterward. Would there ever be a way she and Perry could be together? The Tides had rejected her, and Reverie wasn’t even an option. Everyone, and everything, was against them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria pushed away the thoughts. Worrying wouldn’t help anything. She looked up at Liv. “What about Sable?” She rubbed her wrist, feeling the echo of his grip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiv shrugged. “He’s not terrible.... I know … it’s not much of a way to think of the man I’m marrying, but it’s better than I’d hoped. I thought I’d hate him, and I don’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bit her bottom lip, hesitating, like she was deciding whether to say anything more. Then she came to the bed, sitting beside Aria. “When I got here earlier this spring, he was going to let me leave. He told me I could go whenever I wanted, but that since I’d finally arrived, we might as well get to know each other. I didn’t feel as trapped after he said that. It helped me feel less like a thing that was being passed around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria wondered if Sable had said that on purpose. Scires were known for manipulating people. But shouldn’t Liv have seen that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t fawn over him,” Liv continued, “and he likes that. I think he sees me as a challenge.” She fiddled with the green rope around her waist. “And he’s attracted to me. The scent he gives off when I enter a room … it’s not something you can fake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAria stared at the door, listening to footsteps outside fade. “Do you feel the same way about him?” she asked when it was quiet again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No … not the same.” Liv tied the ends of her belt into an elaborate knot as she thought. “When he kisses me, he makes me nervous, but I think it’s because it feels different.” She met Aria’s eyes. “I’ve never kissed anyone other than Roar, and that’s—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shut her eyes, wincing. “This is what I can’t have. I can’t sit here and remember how it feels to kiss Roar when I’m marrying someone else in days. He has to leave. It’s too hard for me like this, and I can’t stand to see him hurting.” She shook her head. “I hate that he makes me feel weak.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/through-the-ever-night-under-the-never-sky-2/page-27.html","bookId":1658,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:20 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:55:20 PM"}
