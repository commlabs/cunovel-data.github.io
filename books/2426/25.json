Even though she might be called a fool and a meddler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColdly she turned back several pages in the book, took her nail file out of the bag and, as neatly as she could, cut out a specimen page, rolled it up into a tight ball and stuffed it into the tip of a finger of one of her gloves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at her face in the mirror. It was pale and she quickly rubbed her cheeks to bring back the colour. Then she put back the look of an apologetic secretary and hurried out and ran across the gravel to the car, clutching the notebook among the folds of her coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe engine of the Mercedes was turning over. Drax glowered at her impatiently as she scrambled back into her seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on. Come on,” he said, putting the car into third and taking his foot off the clutch so that she nearly caught her ankle in the heavy door. The tyres churned up the gravel as he accelerated out of the parking place and dry-skidded into the London road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGala was jerked back, but she remembered to let the coat with her guilty hand in its folds fall on the seat between her and the driver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now the book back into the hip-pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched the speedometer hovering in the seventies as Drax flung the heavy car along the crown of the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to remember her lessons. Distracting pressure on some other part of the body. Distracting the attention. Distraction. The victim must not be at ease. His senses must be focused away. He must be unaware of the touch on his body. Anaesthetized by a stronger stimulus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike now, for instance. Drax, bent forward over the wheel, was fighting for a chance to get past a sixty-foot RAF trailer, but the oncoming traffic was leaving no room on the crown of the road. There was a gap and Drax rammed the lever into second and took it, his horns braying imperiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGala’s hand reached to the left under the coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut another hand struck like a snake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Got you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKrebs was leaning half over the back of the driving seat. His hand was crushing hers into the slippery cover of the notebook under the folds of the coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGala sat frozen into black ice. With all her strength she wrenched at her hand. It was no good. Krebs had all his weight on it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrax had got past the trailer and the road was empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKrebs said urgently in German, “Please stop the car, mein Kapitän. Miss Brand is a spy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrax gave a startled glance to his right. What he saw was enough. He put his hand quickly down to his hip-pocket, and then, slowly, deliberately, put it back on the wheel. The sharp turning to Mereworth was just coming up on his left. “Hold her,” said Drax. He braked so that the tyres screamed, changed down and wrenched the car into the side-road. A few hundred yards down it he pulled the car into the side and stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrax looked up and down the road. It was empty. He reached over one gloved hand and wrenched Gala’s face towards him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can explain it, Sir Hugo.” Gala tried to bluff against the horror and desperation she knew was in her face. “It’s a mistake. I didn’t mean…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder cover of an angry shrug of the shoulders, her right hand moved softly behind her and the guilty pair of gloves were thrust behind the leather cushion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sehen sie her, mein Kapitän. I saw her edging up close to you. It seemed to me strange.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his other hand Krebs had whipped the coat away and there were the bent white fingers of her left hand crushed into the cover of the notebook still a foot away from Drax’s hip-pocket. “So.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word was deadly cold and with a shivering finality. Drax let go her chin, but her horrified eyes remained locked into his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA kind of frozen cruelty was showing through the jolly façade of red skin and whiskers. It was a different man. The man behind the mask. The creature beneath the flat stone that Gala Brand had lifted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrax glanced again up and down the empty road. Then, looking carefully into the suddenly aware blue eyes, he drew the leather driving gauntlet off his left hand and with his right whipped her as hard as he could across the face with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly a short cry was forced out of Gala’s constricted throat, but tears of pain ran down her cheeks. Suddenly she began to fight like a mad woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith all her strength she heaved and fought against the two iron arms that held her. With her free right hand she tried to reach the face that leant over her hand and get at the eyes. But Krebs easily moved his head out of her reach and quietly increased the pressure across her throat, hissing murderously to himself as her nails tore strips of skin off the backs of his hands, but noting with a scientist’s eye as her struggles became weaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrax watched carefully, with one eye on the road, as Krebs brought her under control and then he started the car and drove cautiously on along the wooded road. He grunted with satisfaction as he came upon a cart-track into the woods and he turned up it and only stopped when he was well out of sight of the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGala had just realized that there were no noise from the engine when she heard Drax say ‘there’. A finger touched her skull behind the left ear. Krebs arm came away from her throat and she slumped gratefully forward, gasping for air. Then something crashed into the back of her head where the finger had touched it, and there was a flash of wonderfully releasing pain and blackness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later passers-by saw a white Mercedes draw up outside a small house at the Buckingham Palace end of Ebury Street and two kind gentlemen help a sick girl out and through the front door. Those who were near could see that the poor girl’s face was very pale and that her eyes were shut and that the kind gentlemen almost had to carry her up the steps. The big gentleman with the red face and whiskers was heard to say quite distinctly to the other man that poor Mildred had promised she wouldn’t go out until she was quite well again. Very sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGala came to herself in a large top-floor room that seemed to be full of machinery. She was tied very securely to a chair and apart from the searing pain in her head she could feel that her lips and cheek were bruised and swollen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeavy curtains were drawn across the window and there was a musty smell in the room as if it was rarely used. There was dust on the few pieces of conventional furniture and only the chromium and ebonite dials on the machines looked clean and new. She thought that she was probably in hospital. She closed her eyes and wondered. It was not long before she remembered. She spent several minutes controlling herself and then she opened her eyes again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrax, his back to her, was watching the dials on a machine that looked like a very large radio set. There were three more similar machines in her line of sight and from one of them a thin steel aerial reached up to a rough hole that had been cut for it in the plaster of the ceiling. The room was brightly lit by several tall standard lamps, each of which held a naked high wattage bulb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her left there was a noise of tinkering and by swivelling her half-closed eyes in their sockets, which made the pain in her head much worse, she saw the figure of Krebs bent over an electric generator on the floor. Beside it there was a small petrol engine and it was this that was giving trouble. Every now and then Krebs would grasp the starting-handle and crank it hard and a feeble stutter would come from the engine before he went back to his tinkering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You dam’ fool,” said Drax in German, “hurry up. I’ve got to go and see those bloody oafs at the Ministry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At once, mein Kapitän,” said Krebs dutifully. He seized the handle again. This time after two or three coughs the engine started up and began to purr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It won’t make too much noise?” asked Drax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, mein Kapitän. The room has been soundproofed,” answered Krebs. “Dr Walter assures me that nothing will be heard outside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGala closed her eyes and decided that her only hope was to feign unconscious for as long as possible. Did they intend to kill her? Here in this room? And what was all this machinery? It looked like wireless, or perhaps radar. That curved glass screen above Drax’s head that had given an occasional flicker as Drax fiddled with the knobs below the dials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly her mind started to work again. Why, for instance, was Drax suddenly talking perfect German? And why did Krebs address him as Herr Kapitän? And the figures in the black book. Why did they nearly kill her because she had seen them? What did they mean?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNinety degrees, ninety degrees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLazily her mind turned the problem over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNinety degrees difference. Supposing her figures had been right all the time for the target eighty miles away in the North Sea. Just supposing she had been right. Then she wouldn’t have been aiming the rocket into the middle of France after all. But Drax’s figures. Ninety degrees to the left of her North Sea target? Somewhere in England presumably. Eighty miles from Dover. Yes, of course. That was it. Drax’s figures. The firing plan in the little black book. They would drop the Moonraker just about in the middle of London.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut on London! On London!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo one’s heart really does go into one’s throat. How extraordinary. Such a commonplace and yet there it is and it really does almost stop one breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now, let me see, so this is a radar homing device. How ingenious. The same as there would be on the raft in the North Sea. This would bring the rocket down within a hundred yards of Buckingham Palace. But would that matter with a warhead full of instruments?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was probably the cruelty of Drax’s blow across her face that settled it, but suddenly she knew that somehow it would be a real warhead, an atomic warhead, and that Drax was an enemy of England and that tomorrow at noon he was going to destroy London.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGala made a last effort to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough this ceiling, through this chair, into the ground, The thin needle of the rocket. Dropping fast as light out of a clear sky. The crowds in the streets. The Palace. The nursemaids in the park. The birds in the trees. The great bloom of flame a mile wide. And then the mushroom cloud. And nothing left. Nothing. Nothing, Nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Oh, no!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the scream was only in her mind and Gala, her body a twisted black potato crisp amongst a million others, had already fainted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER XIX\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMISSING PERSON\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBOND SAT at his favourite restaurant table in London, the right-hand corner table for two on the first floor, and watched the people and the traffic in Piccadilly and down the Haymarket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was 7.45 and his second Vodka dry Martini with a large slice of lemon peel had just been brought to him by Baker, the head waiter. He sipped it, wondering idly why Gala was late. It was not like her. She was the sort of girl who would telephone if she had been kept at the Yard. Vallance, whom he had visited at five, had said that Gala was due with him at six.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVallance had been very anxious to see her. He was a worried man and when Bond reported briefly on the security of the Moonraker, Vallance seemed to be listening with only half his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt appeared that all that day there had been heavy selling of sterling. It had started in Tangier and quickly spread to Zurich and New York. The pound had been fluctuating wildly in the money markets of the world and the arbitrage dealers had made a killing. The net result was that the pound was a whole three cents down on the day and the forward rates were still weaker. It was front-page news in the evening papers and at the close of business the Treasury had got on to Vallance and told him the extraordinary news that the selling wave had been started by Drax Metals Ltd. in Tangier. The operation had begun that morning and by close of business the firm had managed to sell British currency short to the tune of twenty million pounds. This had been too much for the markets, and the Bank of England had had to step in and buy in order to stop a still sharper run. It was then that Drax Metals had come to light as the seller. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moonraker-james-bond-3/page-25.html","bookId":2426,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:40:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:40:09 PM"}
