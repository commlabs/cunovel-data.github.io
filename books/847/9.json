The physicians and apothecaries of Hell, finding their patient had a white tongue, inferred he was suffering from a weakness of the stomach and prescribed a diet at once light and nourishing. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Satan swore he had no appetite for aught but a certain earthly dish, which women excel in making when they meet in company, to wit, tongue-pie.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The doctors agreed there was nothing could better suit His Majesty’s stomach.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In an hour’s time the dish was set before the King; but he found it insipid and tasteless.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He sent for his Head Cook and asked him where the pie came from.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “From Paris, sire.

Citizens’ wives, they do their best; but they lack delicacy, they lack the fine touch of genius. Women of the people are clumsier still. For a real good tongue-pie a Nunnery is the place to go to. There’s nobody to match these old maids of Religion for a pretty skill in compounding all the needful ingredients,—fine spices of rancour, thyme of backbiting, fennel of insinuation, bay-leaf of calumny.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This parable is taken from a sermon of the good Father Gillotin Landoulle, a poor, unworthy Capuchin.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3187/87223.html","bookId":847,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 4:42:59 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 4:42:59 PM"}
