Gray\u0027s mother pushed into the dental suite. She pulled a surgical mask from her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s damn lucky,\" his mother said. \"We\u0027ve cauterized the bleeding and hung a second unit of blood. Mickie thinks she\u0027ll do fine. He\u0027s finishing her dressing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMickie was Dr. Michael Corrin, a former teaching assistant of his mother\u0027s who had gone on to medical school, largely based on his mother\u0027s recommendation. The depth of their relationship and trust extended to this midnight house call, a secret rendezvous at the hospital\u0027s neighboring dental facility. A quick ultrasound revealed the night\u0027s first bit of good news. The bullet hadn\u0027t pierced Seichan\u0027s abdominal cavity. The shot had passed just lateral to her pelvic bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When can she be moved?\" Gray asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mickie would rather she spend a few hours here, at the very least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t have that much time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I explained that to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she awake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA nod. \"After the first unit of blood, she grew more responsive. Mickie\u0027s loaded her with antibiotics and analgesics. She\u0027s already sitting up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it\u0027s time to go.\" Gray went to push past his mother. He had observed the ultrasound, but he\u0027d been chased out when the doctor set to work on the wound. No amount of arguing would make the doctor budge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray hadn\u0027t liked letting Seichan out of his sight, so he\u0027d left with the broken obelisk. Seichan was not going anywhere without it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the two pieces of the obelisk in hand, Gray shoved through the door. His mother followed. Gray crossed to the first dental suite. He almost ran into Dr. Corrin as he was stepping out. The young doctor stood as tall as Gray, but he was sandy-haired and whip-thin. A manicured line of beard traced his jawline. Wearing a scowl, Dr. Corrin nodded back to the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She yanked her catheter and asked that I fetch you. And an ultraviolet light.\" He waved a hand toward the rear of the dental office. \"My brother uses one to cure dental composites. I\u0027ll be right back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the way open, Gray entered the suite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith her back to him, Seichan was sitting in a dental chair, naked from the waist up, struggling to pull a borrowed Redskins T-shirt over her head. A steri-drape lay crumpled at her feet. Even with her bare back to him, Gray read the strain of the effort. She had to catch herself on the armrest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mother sidestepped him. \"Let me help you. You shouldn\u0027t be doing that by yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan resisted. \"I\u0027ve got it.\" She lifted an arm to ward off any help, but flinched with a gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enough, young lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray\u0027s mother went to her side and helped her tug the T-shirt over her bare breasts and bandaged midriff. Turning around, Seichan discovered Gray standing there. Her face darkened, abashed. But Gray suspected her embarrassment lay not in being almost caught naked, but in showing weakness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slowly stood, face hardening against the pain. Leaning her rear end against the reclined chair, she rebuttoned her pants, still tight to her hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to speak to your son,\" she said to Gray\u0027s mother, voice hoarse, dismissive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mother glanced to Gray. He nodded to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go check on your father,\" his mother said coldly, and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown the hall, the muted sound of a television started. Apparently Kowalski had found the remote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlone now, Gray and Seichan stared at each other. Neither spoke, both taking a moment to size the other up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Corrin stepped to the door with a handheld lamp. \"This is all we have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will do.\" Seichan tried to raise a hand to ask for it, but her arm trembled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray accepted it, cradling the pieces of obelisk in one arm. \"We\u0027ll need a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" Dr. Corrin followed after Gray\u0027s mother, sensing the tension in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan\u0027s eyes had never left Gray\u0027s face. \"Commander Pierce, I\u0027m sorry I put your family at risk. I underestimated Nasser.\" She gingerly touched her bandaged wound. Acid entered her voice. \"I won\u0027t make that mistake again. I thought I had lost him in Europe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t,\" Gray snapped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes narrowed. \"I didn\u0027t because Sigma command is compromised. The Guild used your own resources to track and expose me. The blame does not fall squarely upon me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray had no argument against that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe touched her forehead as if she had forgotten something, but Gray suspected she was stalling, weighing what to say and what to leave out. \"You must have a thousand questions,\" she mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only one. What the hell is going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer left eyebrow lifted. A strangely familiar gesture, a reminder of their shared past. \"To answer that, we have to start there.\" She nodded to the obelisk. \"If you\u0027ll set it on the instrument table .. .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeeding answers, Gray obeyed, balancing the broken piece atop the base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The lamp . . .\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment, later, with the overhead lights off, Gray bent over and studied the rows of illuminated letters glowing upon the black stone, across all four surfaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not recognize the lettering as any hieroglyphs or runes he\u0027d ever seen. He glanced across at her. The whites of Seichan\u0027s eyes glowed in the ultraviolet backwash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you\u0027re looking at is angelic script,\" she said. \"The language of the archangels.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray\u0027s brow crinkled with his disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" she said. \"Insane. The script\u0027s origin traces back to both early Christianity and ancient Hebrew mysticism. If you want to know more—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Skip it. I\u0027d rather find out what you meant when you said that the obelisk could save the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned back, glancing away—then her eyes flicked to him. \"Gray, I need your help. I have to stop them, but I can\u0027t do it alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do what alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go against the Guild. What they are attempting. ..\" Again there was that flash of fear from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray frowned. When he\u0027d first run into Seichan, she had been attempting to explode weaponized anthrax over Fort Detrick. Considering such callousness, what would scare her now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I helped you in the past,\" she said, trying the guilt card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To defeat a mutual enemy,\" he countered. \"And to save your own skin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that\u0027s all I\u0027m looking for here again. Cooperation to defeat a mutual enemy. And it\u0027s not just my life in jeopardy this time. Hundreds of millions are threatened. And it\u0027s already started. The seeds are planted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded to the obelisk\u0027s glowing writing. \"All that is stopping the Guild is locked in this riddle. If we could solve it first, there would be some hope. But I\u0027ve gone as far as I can alone. I need fresh eyes, someone with more knowledge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you expect the two of us to be able to solve what thwarts the Guild with its vast resources. If we brought all of Sigma into the picture—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d be handing the Guild their victory. There is a mole in Sigma. Whatever Sigma learns, the Guild will know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was right. It was worrisome, to say the least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you propose we go it alone. Just the two of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And one other . . . if he\u0027ll cooperate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When it comes to dialing with angels and archaeology, there is only one other person I respect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray knew immediately to whom she was referring. \"Vigor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"I left Monsignor Verona a calling card, a mystery to begin solving on his own. If you cooperate, we\u0027ll continue on.\" She touched the obelisk, wobbling the broken half. \"To the next step on the angelic path.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And where is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother shake of her head. She certainly was not going to make this easy. \"I will tell you when we are away. As it is, we must get moving. The longer we sit in one place, the greater risk of our exposure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached for the obelisk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray beat her to it. He snatched up the larger half of the broken obelisk and raised it over his head. He\u0027d had enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Destroy it if you want,\" Seichan warned. \"I still won\u0027t tell you anything more. Not until we\u0027re safely away and you agree to help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray ignored her. \"I assume you already made copies of the script here, probably even photos.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Several in fact,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brought his arm down and smashed the obelisk against the floor. It shattered into several pieces, skittering across the linoleum. A small gasp of surprise escaped Seichan, indicating she had no clue anything was hidden inside the statue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What. . . what have you done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray bent down and picked through the pieces to retrieve the chunk of silver from the debris. He straightened. In his fingers, he held what was hidden inside the stone. He was momentarily stunned silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted the large silver crucifix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan\u0027s eyes widened with recognition. She jerked closer, oblivious of any pain. \"It cannot be. You found it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Found what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Friar Agreer\u0027s cross.\" Her voice lowered, both angry and mortified. \"I had it all along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is Friar Agreer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Friar Antonio Agreer. The priestly confessor to Marco Polo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarco Polo?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTired of the riddles and half statements, Gray snapped harshly. \"Seichan, what the hell is going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waved to a side chair, where her ripped leather bomber jacket had been tossed. \"We have to get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe refused to move, blocking her as she stepped toward the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lowered her chin, her eyes going hard. \"Gray, make up your damned mind. I don\u0027t have the time.\" She made to push past him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-19.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
