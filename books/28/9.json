If the initials A. L. O. E. existed in her mind as a future possibility, they had at least not yet appeared upon any printed page.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e From time to time, however, her pen was busy; still in the old line of comic or tragic plays, for home amusement. In 1847 she wrote The Castle of Sternalt; a Tragedy in Two Acts; belonging to the Cavalier and Roundhead period of England’s history. In that same year she also accomplished Grimhaggard Hall; a Farce in Two Acts—not historical, but highly comic. After which came apparently a gap of two or three years; and in 1850 she wrote, Who Was The Witch? a Drama in Three Acts—historical again, belonging to the days of the Saxons and of King Harold, half comic, half tragic.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It does not appear from these three plays that her gift in the dramatic line had made any marked advance during the ten years or more which had elapsed since first she launched out in this direction. Probably an entirely different mode of life from hers, a less sheltered existence, a more extensive knowledge of human nature in its countless phases, is an absolute necessity to such development. There is in them much latent power, however[72] unequal and undeveloped, whether it be of the grave or of the sparkling and humorous description. The following quotation from the Castle of Sternalt will give an idea of her tragic style at that period. Ravensby, the hero, is a Cavalier, imprisoned and condemned to death on a false charge of murder.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ACT IV.—SCENE I.\n\u003cbr\u003e A DUNGEON.\n\u003cbr\u003e Ravensby.\n\u003cbr\u003e ‘Th’ intensity of grief destroys itself.\n\u003cbr\u003e The torturer beholds his Victim stretched\n\u003cbr\u003e Unconscious, pain itself o’ercome by pain.\n\u003cbr\u003e Fate dooms me now to death; last punishment\n\u003cbr\u003e Which mortal can inflict,—and yet I feel\n\u003cbr\u003e There’s mercy in the doom.

Can he speak thus who hath so long espoused\n\u003cbr\u003e The Royal cause, and served that cause so well?\n\u003cbr\u003e Who, girt with honours, well deserved, hath stood\n\u003cbr\u003e One in a noble Brotherhood of Fame!\n\u003cbr\u003e Where are the Cavaliers who fought with thee\n\u003cbr\u003e In battle, side by side, who with thee shared\n\u003cbr\u003e The feast, and drained the wine-cup to your King?\n\u003cbr\u003e Where are they now? what, gone? not one remains,\n\u003cbr\u003e T’assert thy innocence, or shield thee from\n\u003cbr\u003e An ignominious death.

From other lips such words I had not borne.\n\u003cbr\u003e Why should I thus urge life upon thee,—why\n\u003cbr\u003e Seek to preserve thee in thine own despite?\n\u003cbr\u003e O thou art worthy of a nobler cause;\n\u003cbr\u003e I see in thee one who can nobly dare,\n\u003cbr\u003e Firmly resolve, and boldly execute;—\n\u003cbr\u003e And what a bright career before thee lies——\n\u003cbr\u003e Rav. A brief one,—from the dungeon to the tomb.\n\u003cbr\u003e Agn. To die a Traitor in the eyes of men.\n\u003cbr\u003e Rav. Better than live a villain in my own.\n\u003cbr\u003e Depart, and leave me to my fate. Away!\n\u003cbr\u003e Agn. O brave and glorious! I will tempt no more.\n\u003cbr\u003e My pride is humbled. I have found a soul\n\u003cbr\u003e That soars beyond mine own. I would not rob\n\u003cbr\u003e Thy pinion of one plume. I watch thy flight\n\u003cbr\u003e With kindling emulation. O for power\n\u003cbr\u003e To follow it, that I above this sphere\n\u003cbr\u003e Might rise; companion, not unworthy thee!\n\u003cbr\u003e Rav. A step approaches.\n\u003cbr\u003e Agn. None must see me here. [Retires into shade.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Agnes in the end confesses herself guilty of the crime for which he is condemned to death;—in time to save his[75] name from lasting disgrace, though not in time to save his life.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Who Was The Witch? though in parts amusing enough, is hardly so good as the others. Modern English puns sit oddly upon a background of pre-medi?val Saxon history. Grimhaggard Hall is perhaps one of A. L. O. E.’s most comic and laughable jeux-d’esprit, over which one can picture the family as enjoying many a hearty laugh. The perpetual play upon words, and the almost rollicking fun and nonsense of the whole, remind one of her earlier effort, The Pretender, already given at length; though the later-written farce is in some respects scarcely equal to the girlish achievement. Both these plays illustrate well the frisky and frolicsome side of a character which was in some respects not only intensely serious, but absolutely stern. Charlotte Tucker’s was truly a many-sided nature.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Whether at this time she had already begun to write anything in the shape of children’s story-books does not appear. It is by no means unlikely, since the date of her first appearance in print was now fast drawing near.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The chief characters in Grimhaggard Hall are—Mr. Cramp; Mr. Scull, an artist; Mr. Wriggle, a tutor; Miss Cob; and Nellie, daughter of Mr. Cramp.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e ACT I.\n\u003cbr\u003e Library in Grimhaggard Hall. Nellie and Mr. Wriggle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nellie. O my dear old Tutor, I shall be so sorry to lose you! I wish that my good Father had kept to his old plan, and instead of sending Bob to College had kept both you and him here. This house is so intolerably dull. When you are gone I shall sit looking at the old stones in the old wall, till I petrify into one myself. Why, the very spiders’ webs look as though there were no business doing in them, and not a fly nor even a broom would call at the door! Heigh-ho!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [76]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wrig. You forget, honoured Madam, the governess, Miss Cob, who is expected here to-morrow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. A governess; the horror! then I hear that she is an oddity; so absent; very learned though, and extremely well-informed. I am rather old for a governess; I was seventeen last March. It would have been quite a different thing to have gone on with my studies here with you and Bob. Do you know that, without vanity, I consider that I have made amazing progress during the month that you have been here?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wrig. In Geography, Madam, for instance. Let me have the honour of recalling to your oblivious memory that only yesterday you forgot the situation of Guinea.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. Nonsense! I said that it was on the Gold Coast, and wished I had it in my own pocket.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wrig. I have remarked with regret, if you will permit me to say it, an aversion to consulting the Atlas, which——\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. Keep me from you and your atlas! Atlas carried the world, and you would burden me with the Atlas. I hardly consider myself competent yet to carry the whole globe on my poor little shoulders. I should like to know what is the use of knowing the situation of this place and that place, to one who never has the satisfaction of seeing any place at all beyond the walls of our stupid garden. I wish that the cross old gentleman who bequeathed my father Grimhaggard Hall, had lived to repent it, that I do! I would rather live in the narrowest lane in the City than be cooped up here like a toad in a block. I’ve no fancy to be a Penelope,—stitch, stitch, stitch!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wrig. Penelope was a distinguished ornament to her sex.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. O dear Tutor, I know that she was a duck of a queen, but distinguished for nothing but her web-feat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wrig. The resource of literature remains to you, Madam, which was never open to her. I would again venture to draw your attention to the subject of Geography.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. O no more of that, I beg, my dear Mr. Wriggle. I know that Ham and Sandwich are in the kitchen, China in the cupboard, and Madeira in the cellar. That is enough for me. I regard Geography simply in reference to utility. I’m quite a utilitarian by principle. You know that the greatest navigator was a Cook; I dare say that he discovered Chili, Cayenne, and Cura?oa. Now do you know, my wise old Tutor, in spite of your white hair and all your learning, I think that I could puzzle you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [77]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wrig. It would be difficult, Madam, to place a limit to your powers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. Tell me, why is Botany Bay called Botany Bay?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wrig. I am not, I must own, aware from what the name is derived. Probably the Botanist has there discovered some new and curious specimens of plants.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. O you must have come from Dunse or the Scilly Isles. Botany Bay is called Botany Bay, because blossoms of the birch and sprigs of the gallows-tree are transplanted there without their leaves.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wrig. I see! I see! Ha, ha!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. I wonder if Miss Cob will understand a joke,—if she will ever perpetrate a pun. Do you know I fancy her such a prim old quiz? I should like to know whether she will play at chess with Papa, or teach me the guitar, as you do. Do you think that she will endure this house?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wrig. The total want of all society, except that which the walls of Grimhaggard Hall have the honour constantly to enclose, may perhaps have an effect upon the lady’s spirits not altogether exhilarating; but when your brother returns from College, perhaps he may be accompanied by some of his fellow-students.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. Students; what an idea! When my Father would sooner see a Goblin than a young man under any circumstances!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wrig. Is not this rather a peculiar—rather a singular—I would say prejudice? Could such a word be applicable to the excellent Mr. Cramp?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. I should say very singular indeed, did I not know its cause.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wrig. Is it presumptuous to inquire what that cause may be?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. O I’ll tell you in a moment. It all arises out of the freaks and folly of Mr. Grim of Grimhaggard Hall, who had, I am sorry to say, the kindness to leave us this property, and thereby consigned me to the dolefuls for the rest of my life.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wrig. Was the estate bequeathed under any unpleasant conditions? I never heard your respected father complain of such.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. O it is all right to my father because it was all left to him. But you shall hear. This Mr. Grim had a promising nephew, ... and this nephew, Mr. Atherton by name, was very naturally considered as Mr. Grim’s heir, the old gentleman never having persuaded any lady to marry him, and reign like another Proserpine over the gloomy shades of Grimhaggard Hall.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wrig. How then came the estate to your Father?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [78]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. Have a little patience, my dear Mr. Wriggle, and you shall be as learned as myself upon the subject. Well, this old uncle quarrelled with this young nephew. I think that it was about politics or some such absurdity; the elder was a Tory and the junior a Radical; no, the young one was the Tory, and the old one the Radical; and this radical question was the root of the quarrel. Now what do you think the spiteful old gentleman did?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wrig. Disinherited his nephew, and left the property to Mr. Cramp.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. That would have been a pretty severe lesson to the young man; but what do you say to the affectionate uncle leaving such a clause as this in his will? That my father must only have and hold this said Grimhaggard Hall, on condition of poor Mr. Atherton’s never even crossing the threshold of what he once considered his home! The place must be perfectly heir-tight. If he ever passes twelve hours under this roof, the whole estate is to revert to him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wrig. Such a clause argues little charity; but perhaps it may ultimately prove for the benefit of him whom it was designed to injure.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. Ah, you think that Mr. Atherton may still manage to get his property out of his old uncle’s clause! I am sure I wish that Mr. Grim had left the dull place to him, or any one but us; but then my Father is not of my mind. Yet even he has not an atom of enjoyment of his prize, from the perpetual fear of losing it. He has heard that young Atherton is very sharp and clever; of course he will try to regain his rights by any means that may present themselves; so I really believe that Papa expects him to appear some day or other through the key-hole. The gate is kept constantly locked,—luckily, one can see the high-road from the house,—nothing in the shape of a Man is permitted to pass it; we have even parted with all men-servants, lest Mr. Atherton should manage to get in disguised as a lackey. Grimhaggard Hall is a regular Convent. A travelling pedlar is regarded with suspicion; the butcher-boy must hand the leg of mutton over the gate; the young apothecary is an object of terror,—I could not have a tooth pulled out, were I to die for it. Dear me, how it is raining! The weather seems endeavouring to find out whether it be possible to make Grimhaggard Hall look a little duller than usual.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wrig. I hope Miss Cob may be fortunate in having finer weather for her journey to-morrow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. She is on the road to-day, like John Gilpin’s hat and wig.[79] She was to leave Puddingham this morning, and rest to-night at the Jolly Bridecake at Mouseton. I hope the coach is provided with oar and rudders, for she will certainly have to swim for it!...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In the midst of this talk an artist’s gig is smashed outside the front gate; and the artist, Mr. Scull, being much shaken, is actually admitted within the walls of the old Hall, to the great disquiet of Mr. Cramp, who is determined that, come what may, the young man shall not remain through the night. It is a pelting day, and no other conveyance seems likely to pass; while the artist is plainly unable to walk the distance which separates Grimhaggard Hall from the next town. While this matter is still under discussion, a ring at the front-door bell is heard, and ‘a woman of very singular appearance’ is seen ‘standing in the rain, without an umbrella, as if water were her native element.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. Who can it be? [Runs to the window.] Why, how tall she is! she looks as though she had grown a foot since that dress was made for her. What an extraordinary figure! Why, Sarah is actually letting her in. Papa, we have not had so many visitors since we came here. Grimhaggard Hall is growing quite gay.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cramp. I will go and meet this strange guest. [Exit.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. It cannot be—it cannot be Miss Cob! Such a governess would kill me either with terror or with laughter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wrig. You were in expectation, Madam, of some one remarkable for eccentricity. We must not always judge of the qualities of the mind by the singularity of the exterior.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Enter Mr. Cramp and Miss Cob.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cramp. Miss Cob,—my daughter. [Nelly makes a curtsey, Miss Cob a bow.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. [Aside to Wriggle.] I shall never keep my countenance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wrig. [Aside.] That is to be regretted, for it is a very fair one.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cramp. We did not expect you to-night, Ma’am. Did you not purpose sleeping at Mouseton?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss C. The inn was chock-full.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cramp. But how came you to be on foot? You never have walked all the way! Where is your conveyance? It would be of the utmost service to me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [80]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss C. Smashed on the road.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cramp. Well, if all the gigs and cabs in England are not in coalition against me this day! And where is your luggage?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss C. Coming. You did not expect me to carry it on my back, like a snail, did ye?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wrig. Miss Cob, like an experienced general, leaves her baggage in the rear.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. I should rather have expected to find it in the van. You are very wet, Ma’am; shall I help you off with your cloak?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss C. O never mind. I’m neither sugar nor salt; only it’s a plaguy thing to have one’s dress so long, walking through such a bog.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. [Aside.] How long she may have had her dress, I know not; but in one sense I am sure it is short enough.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss C. This seems a good big house, but rather too much like a prison. Have you those bars on all the windows?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cramp. On all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss C. And how many men-servants do you keep?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cramp. None at all. [Aside.] What impertinent curiosity!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. [Aside.] Shall I venture to address her again? I can scarcely command myself. [Aloud.] Pray, Ma’am, are you fond of music?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss C. I’m a regular dab at it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. What instrument do you play?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss C. All sorts of instruments, from the drum to the Jew’s harp.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. You don’t play the cornopion?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss C. Like bricks,—and sing all the time. You shall hear me to-morrow. [All stare in mute amazement.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cramp. May I trouble you, Ma’am, to let me see your letter of introduction from Lady Myres again?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss C. Heartily welcome. You will read all about me there. Full details of manners and accomplishments. She says I’m a little absent sometimes; so if ever I make a few trifling blunders, I hope you’ll set them down to that score.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. [Aside to Wriggles.] I wish she were absent now, for I think I shall die in convulsions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss C. I’ll teach you all sorts of things suitable for a lady. Knitting, netting,—crow—crowfoot ...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wrig. I see that nothing is beyond your apprehension.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss C. What do you say about apprehension? Are you a police officer?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [81]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wrig. No, Madam, I am a humble Professor of Geography, Geology, Algebra, and ...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss C. O I’m a match for you in all that, and I know Latin, Greek, and American besides.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wrig. And what tongue, Madam, do you prefer?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss C. O I’m not particular about those sort of things; but if you want my opinion, why I think pickled tongues are excellent.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wrig. [Turning away laughing.] This is either too bad or too good! [Aloud.] And your other studies, Ma’am?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss C. As for Arithmetics, they’re at my fingers’-ends.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. I have not yet got beyond the Rule of Three.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss C. You shall know the Rule of Four-and-twenty, before I have done with you. We’ll skip the 4, 5, and 6.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. And the Rule of Three inverse?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss C. In verse? Yes, you shall have it in all sorts of verse, merry, tragical, and comical.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. [Aside.] I shall expire with laughter. [Retires to the window.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wrig. [Aside.] I really cannot stand this any longer. [Follows her.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Scull (the artist). Pray, Madam, may I venture to ask if you paint?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss C. You are a very impudent fellow, to ask a gentle—woman if she paints. Do I look as if I painted?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Scull. I beg a million pardons, Ma’am, but as I paint myself ...\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss C. You paint precious badly then, for you’re as yellow as a cowslip!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cramp. [Aside.] Is the woman intoxicated or insane?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Scull. I think—I imagine that there is a little misapprehension, Ma’am, on your part. My vocation is that of an artist.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. O Miss Cob, you must see his sketches.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Scull. You see, Ma’am, there is a new work to come out at Christmas, which is to be entitled,—The Mouse on the Mantelpiece. The letterpress is in very able hands,—a very pretty little fairy-tale for grown-up children,—that’s all the rage now, you know, in this enlightened age. But the illustrations will be the great thing. A steel-plate frontispiece, of course, in which will be introduced a number of winged mice in a variety of positions,—a very clever thing, I can assure you; and then wood-cuts,—I have the honour of being intrusted with the designs for them. We are to have a different illustration for the top of every column.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [82]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. That will no doubt be capital.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Scull. It will form a very elegant little volume altogether,—the most remarkable publication of the day.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss C. Well, after my wet walk, I think I’d be the better for something to warm me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. You shall have some tea directly, Ma’am.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss C. Tea! Wishy-washy stuff!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. Would you prefer gruel?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss C. Gruel! I wish you joy of your fare!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. [Aside.] The fair Arithmetician looks as though she would not have 3 Scruples to a Dram!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cramp. I dare say Miss Cob is fatigued after her long walk. Nelly, show her the apartment. I hope everything is comfortable there.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nell. Certainly, Papa. [Aside to Wriggle.] At any rate, I will venture to say that her room is better than her company. [Exeunt Nelly and Miss Cob.]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And so on,—the wind-up of the story being that Miss Cob is found to be a burglar in woman’s disguise; while the artist is a harmless nobody. But elderly Wriggles, the tutor, who has lived quietly in the house for a month past, and of whom even Mr. Cramp has had no suspicions, turns out to be the much dreaded nephew, and to him by right Grimhaggard Hall now appertains. As, however, he has managed to fall deeply in love with the punning heroine, all difficulties are solved by their marriage,—Nellie being equally in love with him. Thus the nephew gains the old home, and the uncle does not lose it.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1740/50950.html","bookId":28,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 2:34:53 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 2:34:53 AM"}
