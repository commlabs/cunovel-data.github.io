He heard others in the hallways behind him expressing hope at the calm, but to Jarlaxle, the deceptive peace was just the opposite. The pause revealed to him that their enemies were not foolhardy. The last attack had become a massacre of fleshy crawling beasts - their burned and blasted lumps littered the lawn still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they weren\u0027t finished, to be sure. Given Danica\u0027s report, given Jarlaxle\u0027s understanding of the hatred toward him and toward Cadderly and Danica, he saw no possibility that Spirit Soaring would suddenly be left in peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis night was peaceful, though - undeniably so, paradoxically so, eerily so. And in that quiet, with not even the breath of wind accompanying it, Jarlaxle, and Jarlaxle alone, heard a call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes widened despite his near-perfect control over his emotions, and he reflexively glanced around. He knew how tentative his - and Athrogate\u0027s - welcome was at Spirit Soaring, and he could hardly believe his misfortune as another ally, one who would not likely be accepted by any at Spirit Soaring, demanded an audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to push that quiet but insistent call away, but its urgency only heightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle looked to the forest and focused his thoughts on one large tree, just behind the foliage border. Then, with another glance around, the drow slipped over the balcony railing and nimbly climbed to the ground. He disappeared into the darkness, making his careful way across the wide courtyard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bah, just as I telled ye, elf,\" a sneering Bruenor Battlehammer said to Drizzt as they watched Jarlaxle slip down from his perch. \"Ain\u0027t no friend to any other\u0027n Jarlaxle, that one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA profound sigh reflected Drizzt\u0027s deep disappointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go get Pwent and bottle up that damned annoying dwarf ol\u0027 big-hat there brung with him.\" Bruenor started to turn away, but Drizzt caught him by the shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t know what this is about,\" he reminded them. \"More scouting? Did Jarlaxle see something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bah!\" Bruenor snorted, pulling away. \"Go and see if ye got to see, but I\u0027m already knowing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Await my return,\" Drizzt said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruenor glared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, trust me in this,\" Drizzt begged. \"There is too much at stake for all of us, for Catti-brie. If anyone can help us solve the riddle of her troubles, it is Jarlaxle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thought it was Cadderly. Ain\u0027t that why we\u0027re here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Him, too,\" said Drizzt, and as Bruenor visibly relaxed, he slipped out the window and moved after Jarlaxle. Not a wary creature stirred at his silent passing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver do I find you in curious places, Kimmuriel Oblodra\u0027s fingers waggled to Jarlaxle, using the intricate hand language of the drow. With Cadderly Bonaduce and his pathetic priests? Truly?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this time, we all share concerns, and profit from ... accommodations of mutual benefit, Jarlaxle\u0027s fingers answered. The situation here is desperate, even grave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know more about it than you do, Kimmuriel assured him, and Jarlaxle wore a puzzled expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About the failing of the Weave, perhaps ...?\" he said quietly. Kimmuriel shook his head and responded aloud. \"About your predicament. About Hephaestus and Crenshinibon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the illithid,\" Jarlaxle added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because of the illithid,\" Kimmuriel corrected. \"Yharaskrik, without form and dissipating, found me in Luskan. He is no more a part of this creature they call the Ghost King. He was cast out, to fade to nothingness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he seeks revenge?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Revenge is not the way of illithids,\" Kimmuriel explained. \"Though no doubt Yharaskrik enjoyed the bargain I offered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo tell, said Jarlaxle, with his fingers and his amused expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Its only hope was to journey to the Astral Plane, a place of consciousness without corporeal restraint,\" Kimmuriel explained. \"With the failure of conventional magic and divine magic, its best opportunity for such a journey was a fellow practitioner of psionics - me. Without its own body as anchor, the mind flayer could not facilitate the flight alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You let it go?\" Jarlaxle asked, raising his voice just a bit. He wasn\u0027t as angry as intrigued, however, revealed by the way he reached up to tug at the diatryma feather that was nearly fully regrown in his enchanted hat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To survive as the years pass, Yharaskrik must find a mind hive of illithids. We of psionic power are not unaffected by that which is occurring across the multiverse, and having such allies....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are wretched creatures.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKimmuriel shrugged. \"They are among the most brilliant of all the mortal beings. I know not what will happen to my powers, nor to magic, divine or arcane. I know only that the world is changing - has changed. Even shifting here through the dimensions proved a great risk, but one that I needed to take.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To warn me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To warn and to instruct, for in return for passage, Yharaskrik revealed to me all it knows about the Ghost King, and about the remnants of the artifact, Crenshinibon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am touched at your concern for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are necessary,\" said Kimmuriel, drawing a laugh from Jarlaxle. \"Do tell me, then,\" Jarlaxle said. \"How might I, might we, defeat this Ghost King?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKimmuriel nodded and recounted it all in detail then, echoing Yharaskrik\u0027s lecture about the being that was both Hephaestus and Crenshinibon, about its powers and its limitations. He explained the minions and the gates that brought them to Faerun. He talked of one such rift he had sensed, though had not yet inspected, still opened wide in the lakeside town to the southeast. He spoke of human and dwarf refugees hiding in tunnels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You trust this mind flayer?\" Jarlaxle asked in the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Illithids are trustworthy,\" Kimmuriel replied. \"Loathsome, at times, fascinating always, but as long as their goals are understood, their logic is easily followed. In this case, Yharaskrik\u0027s goal was survival. Its plight was real and immediate, and caused by the Ghost King. Knowing that truth, as I did, I trust in its recounting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle believed that he held some insight into the mindset of illithids as well, for he had been a companion of Kimmuriel Oblodra for a long, long time, and if someone had ever deigned to put a squishy octopoid head on that particular drow, it surely would have fit Kimmuriel well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the brush not far away, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden listened to it all with interest, though much of it was no more than a confirmation of that which they had already surmised about their mighty enemy. Then he listened to Jarlaxle\u0027s reply and instructions, with wide-eyed disbelief, and truly he felt vindicated in trusting Jarlaxle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You cannot demand of me that I take such a risk with Bregan D\u0027aerthe,\" he heard Kimmuriel argue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is worth the potential gain,\" Jarlaxle replied. \"And think of the opportunity here for you to discern so much more of the mystery that is occurring all around us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat last line apparently had the desired effect on Kimmuriel, for the drow bowed to Jarlaxle, turned to the side, and literally cut the air with an outstretched finger, leaving a sizzling vertical blue line in its wake. With a wave, Kimmuriel turned that two-dimensional blue line into a doorway and stepped through, disappearing from sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJarlaxle stood for a bit, hands on hips, digesting it all. Then, with a shake of his head, one of disbelief, even bemusement, the mercenary headed back for Spirit Soaring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time Drizzt arrived, only moments after Jarlaxle, the summons was already out for him and Bruenor to an audience with Cadderly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Jarlaxle, of course. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-ghost-king-transitions-3/page-24.html","bookId":2189,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:54:13 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:54:13 PM"}
