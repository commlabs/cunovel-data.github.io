{"id":8445,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER XXX. THE TREE OF REFUGE.","content":"\u0026nbsp;THE tramp was stout and clumsily made, and although he was strongly made he was not agile. Moreover, the branch by which Robert had helped himself upward was over six feet from the ground, and had only been reached by a leap. The trunk of the tree was large in circumference, and afforded no facilities for climbing. The efforts of the pursuer, therefore, were vain. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Come down!\" he shouted, peremptorily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have already said that I am very comfortable here,\" answered Robert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you mean to defy me?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t wish to have anything to do with you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wish I had a pistol!\" muttered the tramp. \"I\u0027d soon have you down then.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Robert was devoutly thankful that he was not provided with such a weapon. He felt relieved242 by the discovery, for it had occurred to him as possible, and in that event he would have had to make a virtue of necessity and come down.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why didn\u0027t I lay hold of the boy when I had him beside me?\" thought the disappointed tramp. \"Who would have thought he could have sprung up like that?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He determined to try once more what he could accomplish by threats.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Look here, boy, if you know what\u0027s best for yourself, you\u0027ll come down!\" he cried, furiously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think it\u0027s best for me to remain up here,\" said Robert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"When you come down I\u0027ll wring your neck, you little rascal!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That isn\u0027t much inducement for me to come down,\" said Robert, coolly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If you come down within five minutes and hand over your money, I\u0027ll let you go without doing you any harm.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s very kind of you, but I need it myself.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Robert\u0027s coolness incensed the tramp, who would have felt more satisfaction if his intended victim had exhibited terror.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 243\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Robert was reminded of the scene in the woods at Crampton, where Mr. Tarbox had besieged Charlie Davis and himself, and the trick by which they had then escaped. This would not work now, and indeed it didn\u0027t seem clear how he was to escape at all. There was nothing but to remain up in the tree, and try to tire out the patience of the thievish tramp.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Twenty minutes passed. They passed slowly for Robert, but they also passed slowly for his besieger, who was in a hurry to get possession of the boy\u0027s money, and feared some one might come along to whom he could appeal for help. If he had known that Robert had twenty dollars in his pocket his eagerness would have increased.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Are you coming down?\" he demanded, looking up in the tree fiercely.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"When you are gone away,\" answered the boy, composedly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If you wait much longer I\u0027ll murder you when you do come down. You may think I won\u0027t do it, but I\u0027m savage enough to do anything.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t doubt it at all,\" said our hero.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I might tell you of how I\u0027ve served other persons who trifled with me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 244\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do!\" replied Robert. \"It\u0027ll take up the time.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No,\" answered the tramp, suspiciously. \"I don\u0027t care to have you inform against me, but I want you to remember that I am a desperate man.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll take it for granted. I don\u0027t want to fall into the hands of such a man.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The tramp hunted about for a stone to throw at the boy, but in that part of the West stones are not as plenty as in New England, and his kind intentions were frustrated.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Perhaps you think I\u0027ll go away after a while,\" he said presently, \"but that\u0027s where you make a mistake. I will stay here all night, if necessary.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He looked as if he would really carry out his threat, and Robert, it must be admitted, in spite of his coolness of demeanor, began to feel anxious.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What an obstinate ruffian!\" he thought. \"If he keeps his word, it will be decidedly uncomfortable for me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Will no one come along?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That was the thought that kept recurring to him. It seemed to offer the only means of escape.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 245\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At last he heard wheels, and was thankful. So did the tramp, and felt uneasy. But when the carriage came along it turned out to contain a woman and young boy. It would do no good to hail them, for they could not help him, and the tramp might be led to attack and rob them. So Robert was constrained to let the carriage pass, and to find himself once more in solitude with the tramp.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You did well not to speak,\" said the latter, grimly. \"If you had I would have robbed her, too.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Just what I thought,\" returned Robert. \"That seems to be your business.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t be impudent, boy!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Isn\u0027t it the truth?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Come down and you\u0027ll find out.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I know well enough already.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Another half hour passed, and no one came by. At last the two heard a sound and a man whistling; the same seemed approaching.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hope it\u0027s a strong, able-bodied man,\" thought Robert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When at length the man came in sight, a great tide of joy swept over him. It was the very man246 whose presence he would have desired above all others. It was Hercules, who had at one time been employed in the same circus with himself, to perform feats of strength.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3014/83320.html","bookId":277,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:33:14 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:33:14 AM"}
