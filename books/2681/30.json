teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1941, the air force had reluctantly handed over two Lysanders, too slow and heavy for their intended role in battlefield support but ideal for clandestine landings in enemy territory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, under pressure from Churchill, two squadrons of obsolete bombers were assigned to SOE, although the head of Bomber Command, Arthur Hams, never stopped scheming to get them back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the spring of 1944, when dozens of agents were flown into France in preparation for the invasion, SOE had the use of thirty-six aircraft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plane the Jackdaws boarded was an American- made twin-engined Hudson light bomber, manufactured in 1939 and since made obsolete by the four-engined Lancaster heavy bomber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Hudson came with two machine guns in the nose, and the RAF added a rear turret with two more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the back of the passenger cabin was a slide like a water chute, down which the parachutists would glide into space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no seats inside, and the six women and their dispatcher lay down on the metal floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were cold and uncomfortable and scared, but Jelly got a fit of the giggles, which cheered them all up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey shared the cabin with a dozen metal containers, each as tall as a man and equipped with a parachute harness, all containing-Flick presumed-guns and ammunition to enable some other Resistance circuit to run interference behind German lines during the invasion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter dropping the Jackdaws at Chatelle, the Hudson would fly on to another destination before turning around and heading back to Tempsford.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTakeoff had been delayed by a faulty altimeter, which had to be replaced, so it was one o\u0027clock in the morning when they left the English coastline behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the Channel, the pilot dropped the plane to a few hundred feet above the sea, trying to hide below the level of enemy radar, and Flick silently hoped they would not be shot at by ships of the Royal Navy, but he soon climbed again to eight thousand feet to cross the fortified French coastline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stayed high to traverse the \"Atlantic Wall,\" the heavily defended coastal strip, then descended again to three hundred feet, to make navigation less difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe navigator was constantly busy with his maps, calculating the plane\u0027s position by dead reckoning and trying to confirm it by landmarks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moon was waxing, and only three days from full, so large towns were easily visible, despite the blackout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, they generally had antiaircraft batteries, so had to be avoided, as did army camps and military sites, for the same reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRivers and lakes were the most useful terrain features, especially when the moon was reflected off the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForests showed as dark patches, and the unexpected absence of one was a sure sign that the flight had gone astray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gleam of railway lines, the glow of a steam engine\u0027s fire, and the headlights of the occasional blackout- breaking car were all helpful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the way, Flick brooded over the news about Bnan Standish and the newcomer Charenton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story was probably true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gestapo had learned about the cathedral crypt rendezvous from one of the prisoners they had taken last Sunday at the chateau, and they had set a trap, which Brian had walked into, but he had escaped, with help from Mademoiselle Lemas\u0027s new recruit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all perfectly possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Flick hated plausible explanations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt safe only when events followed standard procedure and no explanations were required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they approached the Champagne region, another navigation aid came into play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a recent invention known as EurekalRebecca.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA radio beacon broadcast a call sign from a secret location somewhere in Reims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crew of the Hudson did not know exactly where it was, but Flick did, for Michel had placed it in the tower of the cathedral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the Eureka half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the plane was Rebecca, a radio receiver, shoehorned into the cabin next to the navigator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were about fifty miles north of Reims when the navigator picked up the signal from the Eureka in the cathedral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe intention of the inventors was that the Eureka should be in the landing field with the reception committee, but this was impracticable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe equipment weighed more than a hundred pounds, it was too bulky to be transported discreetly, and it could not be explained away to even the most gullible Gestapo officer at a checkpoint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichel and other Resistance leaders were willing to place a Eureka in a permanent position, but refused to carry them around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the navigator had to revert to traditional methods to find Chatelle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, he was lucky in having Flick beside him, someone who had landed there on several occasions and could recognize the place from the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the event, they passed about a mile to the east of the village, but Flick spotted the pond and redirected the pilot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey circled around and flew over the cow pasture at three hundred feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick could see the flare path, four weak, flickering lights in an L shape, with the light at the toe of the L flashing the prearranged code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pilot climbed toward six hundred feet, the ideal altitude for a parachute drop: any higher, and the wind could blow the parachutists away from the dropping zone; much lower, and the chute might not have time to open fully before the agent hit the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready when you are,\" said the pilot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not ready,\" Flick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter?\" \"Something\u0027s wrong.\" Flick\u0027s instincts were sounding alarm bells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not just her worries about Brian Standish and Charenton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pointed west, to the village.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, no lights.\" \"That surprises you? There\u0027s a blackout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it\u0027s after three o\u0027clock in the morning.\" Flick shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the countryside, they\u0027re careless about the blackout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there\u0027s always someone up: a mother with a new baby, an insomniac, a student cramming for finals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve never seen it completely dark.\" \"If you really feel there\u0027s something wrong, we should get out of here fast,\" the pilot said nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething else was bothering her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to scratch her head and found her helmet in the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought evaded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat should she do? She could hardly abort the mission just because the villagers of Chatelle were obeying the blackout rules for once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plane overflew the field and banked to turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pilot said anxiously, \"Remember, each time we over fly in- creases the risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone in that village can hear our engines, and one of them might call the police.\" \"Exactly!\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We must have awakened the entire place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet no one has switched on a light!\" \"I don\u0027t know, country folk can be very incurious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey like to keep themselves to themselves, as they always say.\" \"Nonsense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re as nosy as anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is peculiar.\" The pilot looked more and more worried, but he continued circling Suddenly it came to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The baker should have lit his oven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can normally see the glow from the air.\" \"Could he be closed today?\" \"What day is it? Saturday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA baker might close on a Monday or a Tuesday but never on a Saturday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0027s happened? This is like a ghost town!\" \"Then let\u0027s get out of here.\" It was as if someone had rounded up the villagers, including the baker, and locked them in a barn-which was probably what the Gestapo would have done if they were lying in wait for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could not abort the mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was too important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut every instinct told her not to parachute into Chatelle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A risk is a risk,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pilot was losing patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what do you want to do?\" Suddenly she remembered the containers of supplies in the passenger cabin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s your next destination?\" \"I\u0027m not supposed to tell you.\" \"Not usually, no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now I really need to know.\" \"It\u0027s a field north of Chartres.\" That meant the Vestryman circuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know them,\" Flick said with mounting excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis could be the solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could drop us with the containers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere will be a reception committee waiting, they can take care of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe could be in Paris this afternoon, Reims by tomorrow morning.\" He reached for the joystick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that what you want to do?\" \"Is it possible?\" \"I can drop you there, no problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tactical decision is yours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re in command of the mission-that was made very clear to me.\" Flick considered, worrying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer suspicions might be unfounded, in which case she would need to get a message to Michel via Brian\u0027s radio, saying that although her landing had been aborted, she was still on her way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in case Brian\u0027s radio was in Gestapo hands, she would have to give the minimum of information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, that was feasible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could write a brief radio signal for the pilot to take back to Percy: Brian would have it in a couple of hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would also have to change the arrangements for picking up the Jackdaws after the mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt present, a Hudson was scheduled to land at Chatelle at two a.m.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon Sunday, and if the Jackdaws were not there, to return the following night at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Chatelle had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebeen betrayed to the Gestapo and could no longer be used, she would have to divert the Hudson to another landing field at Laroque, to the west of Reims, code- named Champ d\u0027Or.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mission would take an extra day, because they would have to travel from Chartres to Reims, so the pickup flight would have to come down at two a.m.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon Monday, with a fall-back on Tuesday at the same hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe weighed consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiverting to Chartres meant the loss of a day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut landing at Chatelle could mean the entire mission failed and all the Jackdaws ended up in Gestapo torture chambers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was no contest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go to Chartres,\" she said to the pilot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Roger, wilco.\" As the aircraft banked and turned, Flick went back to the cabin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jackdaws all looked expectantly at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s been a change of plan,\" she said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/jackdaws/page-30.html","bookId":2681,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:10 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:09:10 AM"}
