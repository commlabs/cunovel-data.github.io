I hadn’t thought about it in those terms. If it would make things easier for you, I could move out of the area after the baby’s born, or…before. Whichever you prefer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t like that strategy at all. “What about our parents?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about them?” She seemed puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRich couldn’t speak for Jamie’s mother, but he knew his own, and she’d give him an earful the minute she heard about this craziness. “You don’t expect our parents to accept this sitting down, do you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t plan to tell them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gaped at her. “What do you intend to do? Run off and have the baby and then go home and present our parents with a surprise grandchild?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My mother, yes, but not yours. I don’t intend to tell anyone you’re the baby’s father. That’ll be between you and me. No one else needs to know. As far as my mother’s concerned, all I’m going to say is that I was artificially inseminated, but not by whom. That would only complicate matters, don’t you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis didn’t work any better for Rich than Jamie’s other ideas, especially the one about moving away. He rubbed his face, hoping that would help him sort out his thoughts. It didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I suppose you’ll want a few days to think this over?” She eyed him speculatively. It was apparent she’d like her answer as quickly as possible, but that was just too bad. This was too important a decision to be made quickly. He needed to weigh all the concerns carefully, think through the pros and cons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found the whole situation unsettling. Sure he’d like to be a father, but he’d prefer that it happened in the traditional way. His first instinct was to reject her suggestion outright, but Jamie was staring at him with those big, round eyes of hers, obviously doing her best not to sway him. To his regret, Rich discovered that he couldn’t turn down her request without at least considering it. Their friendship was worth that much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give me a week,” he said after a strained minute or two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A week,” she repeated slowly. “Should I call you or will you call me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll call you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded and stood up to leave, pausing at the front door. “Before I go, there’s one more thing I’d like to say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I … I truly believe we’d have a beautiful child, but if it isn’t meant to be, then I can accept your decision. I’m going to have a baby. I’d just rather it was yours than some stranger’s.” With that, she was out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter she’d left, Rich resumed pacing, unable to stand still. His thoughts were a tangle of confused reactions, and part of him was laughing at the absurdity of Jamie’s proposition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir baby! Their baby?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d never even kissed, and she was proposing they create a child together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d told him she expected nothing from him, other than the pregnancy. Although he was sure she hadn’t meant to sound so cold and calculating, that was exactly what Rich felt. She’d made it seem so…impersonal. Even that parting shot about having a beautiful child got to him. With those hazel-green eyes of hers and his height… He forcefully pushed the idea from his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough he’d asked for time to make his decision, Rich already knew what his answer would be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted no part of this craziness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie made a genuine effort not to think about Rich for the next few days. She’d stated her case, explained what needed to be explained without resorting to emotions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hundred times since their talk, she’d thought of all the things she might’ve said to get him to agree.…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mind was muddled with regrets. Rich was a good friend. Too good to risk ruining their relationship because she was determined to have a child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d insulted him. She’d known, from his stunned look, that his immediate instinct had been to say no. Good grief, who wouldn’t? It was only because of their friendship that he’d been courteous enough to consider her proposal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot for the first time, Jamie repressed the urge to call him and withdraw the suggestion. With everything in her, she wished she hadn’t said a word. And in the same instant she prayed with all her heart, with all her being, that he’d say yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only she’d approached him differently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only she’d told him how much his child would mean to her, how she’d love that child her whole life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only she’d assured him what a good mother she was going to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRich had made plans to go to his brother Jason’s apartment on Sunday afternoon to watch the Seahawks football game. Since Rich had given Bill Hastings their fifty-yard-line tickets, the least Rich thought he could do was bring the beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClose to one, nearly an hour late, Rich arrived at his brother’s with a six-pack of Jason’s favorite beer in one hand and a sack full of junk food in the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About time you got here,” Jason muttered when he opened the front door. “The kick-off’s in less than five minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I brought a peace offering,” Rich announced, holding up the six-pack. It wasn’t like him to be late, and he half expected an interrogation from his brother. He was grateful when it looked as though he was going to escape that. If Jason did grill him, Rich didn’t know what he’d say. Certainly not the truth. That he’d been so consumed with indecision over Jamie’s proposal, he’d lost track of the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s going to take a whole lot more than a few beers to make up for the loss of those tickets, little brother,” Jason complained as he led Rich to the sofa. “Last I heard, scalpers were getting three hundred bucks for this game, and my brother gave ours away.” There was more than a touch of sarcasm in Jason’s voice. “I still don’t understand how Bill Hastings ended up getting our tickets.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRich had been purposely vague about the exchange. “He did me a favor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You couldn’t have bought him dinner?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” It wouldn’t help to tell Jason that the big favor Bill was supposed to have done him had fallen through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn, Jamie was stubborn. Stubborn enough to go ahead and have her baby without him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat stopped him in his tracks. It was her decision. What bothered Rich, what caught him so completely by surprise, was the rush of resentment he felt at the thought of her having another man’s child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, you all right?” Jason asked, claiming the seat next to him on the overstuffed sofa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course I’m all right. Why shouldn’t I be?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know, but you got this funny look all of a sudden.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRich dropped his gaze to the can of beer he clutched in his hand. He offered his brother a weak smile and then relaxed on the sofa. It was a few minutes before his heart rate returned to normal. But he kept thinking about Jamie. She’d have a stranger’s child. Yes, she would. She’d do it in a second. More than once Rich had collided with that pride of hers, and there wasn’t a doubt in his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d do it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You ever thought about being a father?” Rich found himself asking his older brother. He attempted to make the question sound casual but didn’t know if he’d succeeded or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who, me?” Jason teased. “I’m not even married, and frankly I don’t ever plan to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not?” This was news to Rich. Jason dated as often as Rich did—although, come to think of it, Rich might have implied that his social life was more active than it really was. Jason never seemed to lack for gorgeous women. The only time he’d gotten serious, the relationship had turned out badly, but that was years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not the marrying kind,” Jason said, tearing open a bag of potato chips with his teeth. “All women think about is reforming me. Hell, if I want to kick off my shoes and watch a football game on a Sunday afternoon, I don’t want to feel guilty about it. Most married men are henpecked. I prefer my freedom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So do I,” Rich agreed. Marriage wasn’t for him, either. Or for Jamie. He valued his independence. So did she. Jason apparently felt the same way—marriage was too much trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I want to dry my socks in the microwave, there’s no one around to yell at me,” Jason added, then took a deep swallow of his beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You dried your socks in the microwave?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason shrugged. “I forgot to put the load from the washer into the dryer the night before. I needed a pair for work. So it was either that or pop them in the toaster.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRich chuckled. That sounded exactly like something his brother would do. Jason was right: A woman would’ve been horrified had she known about his method of drying socks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the next ten minutes they were both engrossed in the game. At the commercial break, Jason propped his ankle on his knee and turned to Rich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why’d you bring up this marriage thing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No reason. I was just wondering.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about you?” Jason asked. “Isn’t it time you thought about settling down and fathering a houseful of kids?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me?” Rich asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, you. Mom knows any future Mannings will have to come from you and Paul. She’s thrown up her hands in disgust at me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think I’ll get married, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason’s eyes widened with disbelief. “Why not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t look so surprised.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am. You, Richard Manning, are definitely the marrying kind. Women flock to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlainly his older brother had an inflated view of Rich’s sexual prowess, and Rich couldn’t see any reason to disillusion him. “True, but not one of them, in all these years, has appealed to me enough to want to marry her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about Pamela?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That woman’s a—” Rich decided not to say it. “Put it this way. We don’t have much in common.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought you were still seeing her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do occasionally.” He took a swig of his beer and set it down, then reached for a bowl of popcorn. Leaning back, he rested his feet on the coffee table, crossing his ankles. “This is the life.” He made a point of changing the subject, growing uncomfortable with the topic of marriage, although he’d been the one foolish enough to introduce it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t get much better than this,” Jason said enthusiastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again their attention reverted to the television. The Seattle football team, the Seahawks, was playing the Green Bay Packers in a heated contest for the National Football Conference title. The winner would go on to play in the Super Bowl. All of Seattle was excited about the game. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/marriage-of-inconvenience-those-manning-men-1/page-6.html","bookId":1981,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:58 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:25:58 AM"}
