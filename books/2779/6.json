I take a deep breath and wipe tears from my eyes. I am mesmerized by her ability to hypnotize an entire audience with such powerfully portrayed words. Just words. I\u0027m immediately addicted and want to hear more. I\u0027m still immobile when Will puts his arm around my shoulders and leans back into the seat with me, bringing me back to reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI accept his embrace and move my head to his shoulder as we both stare out over the crowd.

His hand touches the side of my head, leaning me slightly forward as his lips brush my forehead. I close my eyes and wonder how much more my emotions can be tested. Three days ago, I was devastated, bitter, hopeless. Today I woke up feeling happy for the first time in months. I feel vulnerable. I try to mask my emotions but I feel like everyone knows what I\u0027m thinking and feeling and I don\u0027t like it. I don\u0027t like being an open book. I feel like I\u0027m up on the stage, pouring my heart out to him, and it scares the hell out of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sit there in the same embrace as several more people perform their pieces. The poetry is as vast and electrifying as the audience. I have never laughed and cried so much. The way these poets were able to lure you into a whole new world, viewing things from a vantage point you have never seen before. Making you feel like you are the mother who lost her baby, or the boy who killed his father, or even the man who got high for the first time and ate five plates of bacon. I feel a connection with these poets and their stories. More so, I feel a deeper connection to Will. I can\u0027t imagine that he\u0027s brave enough to get up on the stage and bare his soul like these people are doing. I have to see it. I have to see him do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe emcee makes one last appeal for performers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will, you can\u0027t bring me here and not perform. Please do one?

Just one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suddenly have the urge to kiss him. I suppress the urge, for now, as I continue to plead. I clasp my hands together under my chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t make me beg,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You already are!\" he laughs. \"Alright, alright. But I\u0027m warning you, you asked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulls his wallet out of his pocket just as the emcee is announcing the start of round two. He stands up, holding his three dollars in the air. \"I\u0027m in!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe emcee shields his eyes with his hand, squinting into the audience to see who spoke up. \"Ladies and Gentlemen it\u0027s one of our very own, Mr. Will Cooper!

I find myself hoping he gets lost on his way back to our booth so that I have time to absorb this. I have no idea how to react. I had no idea that this was his life. That Caulder was his whole life. I’m amazed by his performance but devastated by his words. I wipe tears away with the back of my hand. I don’t know if I’m crying for the loss of Will’s parents, the responsibilities of that loss or the simple fact that he spoke the truth. He spoke about a side of death and loss that never seems to be considered until it’s too late. A side that I\u0027m unfortunately all too familiar with. The Will I watched walk up to the stage is not the same Will I’m watching walk toward me. I\u0027m conflicted, I\u0027m confused, and most of all I\u0027m taken aback. He was beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe notices as I\u0027m wiping tears from my eyes. “I warned you,” he smiles as he slides back into the booth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reaches for his drink and takes a sip, stirring the ice cubes with his straw. I have no idea what to say to him. He completely put it all out there, right in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy emotions take control over my actions. I reach forward and take his hand in mine and he sets his drink back down on the table. He looks at me and smiles as he reaches to my face and traces the side of my cheek. I don’t understand the connection I feel with him. It all seems so fast. I turn his hand over and gently kiss the inside of his palm as we hold each other’s stare. We suddenly become the only two people in the entire room; all the external noise fades into the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes my face in his hands and I close my eyes. I feel his breath draw closer as he pulls my face toward his. When he touches his lips to mine, he hesitates. He slowly kisses my bottom lip, then my top lip. His lips are warm, still wet from his drink. I try to kiss him back, but he pulls away when my mouth responds. I open my eyes and he is smiling at me, still holding my face in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Patience,\" he whispers. He leans in and kisses me on the cheek. He moves his mouth to my other cheek and kisses me again. I close my eyes and inhale as I try to calm the overwhelming impulse I have to wrap my arms around him and kiss him back. I don\u0027t know how he has so much self-control. He presses his forehead against mine and slides his hands down to my arms. Our eyes lock as we open them. It\u0027s during this moment that I finally understand why my mother accepted her fate at the age of eighteen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow,” I exhale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,” he agrees. \"Wow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hold each other’s gaze for a few more seconds when the audience starts to roar again. They are announcing the qualifiers for round two when Will grabs my hand and whispers, \"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I make my way out of the booth, my entire body feels like it\u0027s about to give out on me. I\u0027ve never experienced anything like what just happened. Ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe exit the booth and our hands remain locked as he navigates me through the ever growing crowd and into the parking lot. I didn\u0027t realize how warm I was until the cold Michigan air touches my skin. It feels exhilarating. Or I feel exhilarated. I can\u0027t tell which. All I know is that I wish the last two hours of my life could repeat for eternity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want to stay?\" I ask him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lake, you\u0027ve been moving and unpacking for days. You need sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sleep does sound good,\" I say as I yawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opens my door but before I get in, he wraps his arms around my waist and pulls me to him in a tight embrace. He runs his hand through my hair as I take in his scent. I try to pull him closer, but we can\u0027t seem to get close enough. Several minutes pass as we just stand there, holding on to the moment. I\u0027ve always been so guarded. This new side of me that Will brings out is a side of me I didn\u0027t know I had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe eventually break apart and get in the car. As we drive away from the parking lot I lean my head against the window and watch the club as it minimizes in the rearview mirror. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/slammed-slammed-1/page-6.html","bookId":2779,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:11 PM"}
