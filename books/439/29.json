GUARDS THE WAGON TRAIN, AND DEFEATS AN ATTACK.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"RAIN agin to-day,\" said Shorty, disgustedly, as, on the morning of Dec. 30, 1862, he crawled out of the shelter which he and Si had constructed by laying a pole in the crotches of two young cedars, and stretching their ponchos and pup-tents over it. \"Doggoned if I don\u0027t believe Tennessee was left out in the flood, and they\u0027ve been tryin\u0027 to make up for it ever since. I\u0027d rather have the flood at once, and be done with it, for then I\u0027d join the navy instead of paddlin\u0027 \u0027round in this dirty glue that they call mud.\" \"Never saw such a grumbler, Shorty,\" said Si cheerily, as he punched the soaked embers together to start a blaze to boil their coffee by. \"Last Summer the dust and dry weather didn\u0027t suit you. Do you want to do your soldierin\u0027 in heaven?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hurry up with your grub, boys,\" said the Orderly-Sergeant, who came spattering through the muck of leaves and mud into which the camping-ground had been trampled. \"The regiment\u0027s to move in 15 minutes. The 200th Ind. guards wagon-trains to-day. Yesterday Wheeler\u0027s cavalry got in among our wagons and raised thunderâ€”burnt about a mile of \u0027em.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Shorty grumbled: \"That means a tough day\u0027s work pryin\u0027 wagons out of the mud, and restin\u0027 ourselves between times runnin\u0027 after a lot o\u0027 skippin\u0027, cavortin\u0027 cavalry that\u0027s about as easy to ketch as a half-bushel o\u0027 fleas. Anything I hate it\u0027s rebel cavalry58 all tear-around and yell, and when you git ready to shoot they\u0027re on the other side o\u0027 the hill.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well,\" said Si, removing a slab of sizzling fat pork from the end of his rammer, laying it on his hardtack, and taking a generous bite, \"we mustn\u0027t allow them to take no wagons away from the 200th Ind., slosh around as they may. We want all that grub ourselves.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, hump yourselves,\" said the Orderly-Sergeant, as he spattered on; \"fall in promptly when assembly blows. Got plenty o\u0027 cartridges?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Two or three hours later every man in the 200th Ind., wet to the skin, and with enough mud on him to be assessable as real estate, was in a temper to have sassed his gentle old grandmother and whipped his best friend. He believed that if there was any thing under heavens meaner than Tennessee weather it was an army mule; the teamsters had even less sense and more contrariness than the mules; the army wagon was a disheartening device of the devil, and Tennessee roads had been especially contrived by Jeff Davis to break the hearts of union soldiers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The rain came down with a steady pelt that drove right through to the body. The wagon wheels sank into every mud-hole and made it deeper. Prying out the leading ones seemed only to make it worse for the next. The discouraged mules would settle back in the breech ings, and not pull an ounce at the most critical moments. The drivers would become blundering idiots, driveling futile profanity. In spite of all the mud the striving, pushing, pulling, prying, lifting, shouting 200th Ind. gathered up on their hands and clothes, it increased momentarily in the road.59\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The train had strung out over a mile or more of rocky ledges and abysses of mire. Around each wagon was a squad who felt deeply injured by the certainty that their infernal luck had given them the heaviest wagon, the worst mules, and the most exasperating driver in the whole division.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I couldn\u0027t \u0027ve made a doggoneder fool than Groundhog, that teamster,\" said Shorty, laying down his rail for a minute\u0027s rest, \"if I\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 had Thompson\u0027s colt before my eyes for a pattern. That feller was born addled, on Friday, in the dark of the moon.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Them mules,\" dolefully corroborated Si, scraping an acre, more or less, of red Tennessee soil from his overcoat with a stick, \"need to be broke again with a saw-log. Luck for old Job that the devil didn\u0027t think o\u0027 settin\u0027 him to drive mules. He\u0027d \u0027a-bin a-goner in less\u0027n an hour.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Doggone it, here they come,\" said Shorty, snatching up his gun.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Si looked in the direction of Shorty\u0027s glance. Out of the cedars, a mile or more away, burst a regiment of rebel cavalry, riding straight for the front of the train.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With his tribe\u0027s keen apprehension of danger, Groundhog had jumped from his saddle, nervously unhitched his mule, and sprung into the saddle again, ready for instant fight.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Get off and hook that mule up agin,\" commanded Si sternly. \"Now get on your mule and go to the head of your team, take the leaders by the bridles, and stay there.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If you ain\u0027t standing there holding your mules when we come back I\u0027ll break your worthless neck.\"60\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The bugle sounded \"Rally on the right flank,\" and Si and Shorty joined the others in a lumbering rush over the miry fields toward the right. Their soaked clothes hung about them like lead. They had not a spoonful of breath left when they got to where, half-a-mile away, Co. A had taken a position in the briers behind a rail fence, and had opened a long-ranged fire on the cavalry, which was manuvering as if trying to discover a way to take the company in flank. Another fence ran at right angles away to the right of Co. A\u0027s position. The cavalry started for that.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Capt. McGillicuddy,\" shouted the Colonel, \"take your company back to that fence as quick as you can, run along back of it, and try to keep those fellows on the other side.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Away the panting company rushed for the fence. The field was overgrown with those pests of the Southern plowman, called locally \"devil\u0027s shoe strings,\" which stretch from furrow-ridge to furrow-ridge, and are snares to any careless walker. The excited Indianians were constantly tripped on these, and fell headlong in the mud. Down Si and Shorty went several times, to the great damage of their tempers. But in spite of all rain, mud, lack of breath and devil\u0027s shoe-strings the company got to the fence in advance of the cavalry, and opened a scattering fire as each man could get his damp gun to go off. Si and Shorty ran back a little to a hillock, from which they could get long-distance shots on where the cavalry would probably try to tear down the fence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s all of 600 yards, Si,\" said Shorty, as he leaned against a young oak, got his breath back in long gulps, and studied the ground. \"We kin make it, though, with our Springfields, if they\u0027ll give us time to cool down and git our breaths. I declare I want a whole Township of fresh air every second. That last time I fell knocked enough breath out o\u0027 me to fill a balloon.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There, they\u0027re sendin\u0027 out a squad now to go for the fence,\" said Si, putting his sight up to 600 yards. \"I\u0027ll line on that little persimmon tree and shoot as they pass it. I\u0027ll take the fellow on the clay bank horse, who seems to be an officer. You take the next one on the spotted bay.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Better shoot at the hoss,\" said Shorty, fixing his sight. \"Bigger mark; and if you git the hoss you git the man.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The squad made a rush for the fence, but as the leader crossed the line Si had drawn on the persimmon tree through his sights, his musket cracked, and the horse reared and fell over in the mud. Shorty broke the shoulder of the next horse, and the rider had to jump off.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Bully shots, boys. Do it again,\" shouted the Captain of Co. Q, hurrying some men farther to the right, to concentrate a fire upon the exposed point.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Si and Shorty hastily reloaded, and fired again at the rebels, who had pressed on toward the fence, in spite of the fall of their leader. But not having an object in line to sight on, Si and Shorty did not succeed in bringing anybody down. But as they looked to see the effect, they also saw a cannon-flash from a hill away off behind the cavalry, and the same instant its rifled shot took the top off the young oak about six feet above Si\u0027s head.62\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A Close Shave 62\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Shorty was the first to recover his wits and tongue. \"Doggoned if somebody else hain\u0027t been drawin\u0027 a bead on trees,\" he said, looking into Si\u0027s startled face. \"Knows how to shoot, too.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I didn\u0027t notice that measly gun come up there. Did you, Shorty?\" said Si, trying to get his heart back out of his mouth, so that he could speak plainly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No. I didn\u0027t. But it\u0027s there all the same, and the fellers with it have blood in their eyes. Le\u0027s run over to where the other boys are. I\u0027m a private citizen. I don\u0027t like so much public notice.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They joined the squad which was driving back the rebels who had started out to break the fence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Presently the cavalry wheeled about and disappeared in the woods. The rear was scarcely out of sight, and the 200th Ind. was just beginning to feel a sense of relief, when there was a sputter of shots and a chorus of yells away off to the extreme left.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Just as I expected,\" grumbled Shorty. \"They are jumping the rear of the train now.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Leaving Co. A to watch the head of the train, the rest of the regiment bolted off on the double-quick for the rear. They did not get there a moment too soon. Not soon enough, in fact. As they came over the crest of the hill they saw Co. B, which had been with the rear, having more than it could attend to with a horde of yelling, galloping rebels, who filled the little valley. Co. B\u0027s boys were standing up manfully to their work, and popping away at the rebels from behind fences and rocks, but the latter had already gotten away from them a wagon which had been far to the rear, had cut loose the mules and run them off, and were plundering the wagon, and trying to start a fire under it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The fusillade which the regiment opened as the men grained the crest of the hill, put a different64 complexion on the affair. The rebels recognized the force of circumstances, and speedily rode back out of range, and then out of sight. As the last of them disappeared over the hill the wearied regiment dropped down all around to rest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Groundhog Fled 64\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We can\u0027t rest long, boys,\" said the sympathetic Colonel; \"we\u0027ve got to start these wagons along.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Presently he gave the order:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Go back to your wagons, now, and get them out as quickly as you can.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Si and Shorty took a circuit to the left to get on some sod which had not been trampled into mortar. They heard a volley of profanity coming from a cedar brake still farther to the left, and recognized the voice of their teamster. They went thither, and found Groundhog, who had fled from the scene, after the manner of his race, at the first sound of firing, but had been too scared to fasten up his traces when he unhitched his saddle mule. These had flapped around, as he urged his steed forward, and the hooks had caught so firmly into the cedars when he plunged into the thicket that he was having a desperate time getting them loose.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You dumbed, measly coward,\" said Si. \"I told you I\u0027d blow your head offen you if you didn\u0027t stay by them mules. I ought to do it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t, Si,\" said Shorty. \"He deserves it, and we kin do it some other time. But we need him now in our business. He hain\u0027t much of a head, but it\u0027s all that he\u0027s got and he can\u0027t drive without it. Le\u0027s git the mule loose first.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They got the mule out and turned him around toward the wagons.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now,\" said Shorty, addressing Groundhog, \"you white-livered son-in-law of a jackass, git back to that wagon as fast as you kin, if you don\u0027t want me to run this bayonet through you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was more straining and prying in the dreary rain and fathomless mud to get the wagons started.66\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Shorty,\" said Si, as they plodded alongside the road, with a rail on one shoulder and a gun on the other, \"I really believe that this is the toughest day we\u0027ve had yet. What d\u0027you s\u0027pose father and mother\u0027d say if they could see us?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Earning Thirteen Dollars a Month 57\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They\u0027d probably say we wuz earning our $13 a month, with $100 bounty at the end o\u0027 three years.,\" snapped Shorty, who was in no mood for irrelevant conversation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So the long, arduous day went. When they were not pulling, pushing, prying, and yelling, to get the wagons out of mudholes, they were rushing over the clogging, plowed fields to stand off the nagging rebel cavalry, which seemed to fill the country as full as the rain, the mud, the rocks and the sweeping cedars did. As night drew on they came up to lines of fires where the different divisions were going into line-of-battle along the banks of Stone River. The mud became deeper than ever, from the trampling of tens of thousands of men and animals, but they at least did not have the aggravating rebel cavalry to bother them. They found their division at last in an old cottonfield, and were instantly surrounded by a crowd of hungry, angry men.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where in blazes have you fellers bin all day?\" they shouted. \"You ought to\u0027ve got up here hours ago. We\u0027re about starved.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Go to thunder, you ungrateful whelps,\" said Si. \"You kin git your own wagons up after this. I\u0027ll never help guard another wagon-train as long as I\u0027m in the army.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63216.html","bookId":439,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 8:15:27 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 8:15:27 AM"}
