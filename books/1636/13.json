Ash had seen these pop into place just before his round had struck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to try something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh picked up a rock and sidearmed it at the drone. It was nowhere near as fast as a bullet, but it was a great deal heavier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stone hit, and spanged off one of its metal booms, scratching it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo shields this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drone hesitated, and one boom looked like it twitched. Ash noticed that the three booms were not connected to the center sphere. They all just floated there. What was this thing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt closed on Holly. She fired at it, but its shields snapped into place once again, deflecting the rounds. She looked over the cliff\u0027s edge and took a deep breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was going to jump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way,\" Ash whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed a fist-sized chunk of onyx and hurled it with all his strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt connected—dead center with the drone\u0027s spherical red eye. \"Yes!\" he cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drone rotated to face Ash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis elation instantly evaporated as the thing glided toward him, picking up speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh turned and ran; he jinked right and then left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ground exploded. Heat washed over him, and he flew head over heels. He landed flat on his back, slapping at the last moment to break the fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh rolled, and with only a slight limp, he kept running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hoped the other squads were having better luck. Olivia had picked up Katana squad\u0027s signal. They\u0027d reported they were being forced into Zone 67. They\u0027d lost their signal shortly thereafter. They\u0027d never gotten word from Gladius squad. Either they were dark or dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked back: the drone was almost on top of him. Its single eye heated to a cherry- red cinder, preparing another blast of energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead there was a crevice in the rock, a sinuous two-meter channel that could have been a deep river a million years ago before this place dried up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sprinted for it and dove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe channel was much deeper than he had imagined. He bounced off the walls and landed ten meters farther at the bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shadow of the drone flashed overhead and vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh slowly got to his feet, and held his breath. Had he lost it? Maybe they had a chance after all to— The drone reappeared overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could run down the channel, but with all its twists and turns, he\u0027d be slow. Besides, it didn\u0027t even have to hit him with its energy beam. One shot at the walls and he\u0027d be buried alive. Ash was trapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he stood absolutely still… hoping it could only detect motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drone dropped into the channel and stopped halfway down—staring directly at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eye glowed dull red, heating to molten golden. If Ash didn\u0027t know better he\u0027d say the machine looked angry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needed to let the rest of Saber know where he was, at least know what he had discovered. Radio silence was no help now. He clicked on his COM, and turned up the gain to maximum. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-ghosts-of-onyx-halo-4/page-13.html","bookId":1636,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:56 PM"}
