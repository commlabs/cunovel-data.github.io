I figured there was something in it to take the edge off her hangover. She\u0027d made coffee in a Chemex filter pot and poured me a cup. I stood by the window and drank it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn\u0027t talk. The church bells had taken a break and the Sunday morning silence stretched out. It was a bright day out, the sun burning away in a cloudless sky. I looked down and couldn\u0027t see a single sign of life, not a person on the street, not a car moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finished my coffee and added the cup to the dirty dishes in the stainless-steel sink. Jan used a key to bring the elevator to the floor. She asked if I was going out to Sheepshead Bay and I said I guessed I was. We held onto each other for a moment. I felt the warmth of her fine body through the robe she was wearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll call you,\" I said, and rode the oversized elevator to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn Officer O\u0027Byrne gave me directions over the phone. I followed them, riding the BMT Brighton Line to Gravesend Neck Road. The train came up above ground level at some point after it crossed into Brooklyn, and we rode through some neighborhoods of detached houses with yards that didn\u0027t look like New York at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe station house for the Sixty-first Precinct was on Coney Island Avenue and I managed to find it without too much trouble. In the squad room I played do-you-know with a wiry, long-jawed detective named Antonelli. We knew enough of the same people for him to relax with me. I told him what I was working on and mentioned that Frank Fitzroy had steered it my way. He knew Frank, too, though I didn\u0027t get the impression that they were crazy about each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see what our file looks like,\" he said. \"But you probably saw copies of our reports in the file Fitzroy showed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What I mostly want is to talk with somebody who looked at the body.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wouldn\u0027t the names of officers on the scene be in the file you saw in Manhattan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d thought of that myself. Maybe I could have managed all this without coming out to the ass end of Brooklyn. But when you go out and look for something you occasionally find more than you knew you were looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, maybe I can find that file,\" he said, and left me at an old wooden desk scarred with cigarette burns along its edges. Two desks over, a black detective with his sleeves rolled up was talking on the phone. It sounded as though he was talking to a woman, and it didn\u0027t sound much like police business. At another desk along the far wall a pair of cops, one uniformed and one in a suit, were questioning a teenager with a mop of unruly yellow hair. I couldn\u0027t hear what they were saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAntonelli came back with a slim file and dropped it on the desk in front of me. I went through it, pausing now and then to make a note in my notebook. The victim, I learned, was a Susan Potowski of 2705 Haring Street. She\u0027d been a twenty-nine-year-old mother of two, separated from her husband, a construction laborer. She lived with her kids in the lower flat of a two-family semi-detached house, and she\u0027d been killed around two o\u0027clock on a Wednesday afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer kids found her. They came home from school together around three thirty, a boy of eight and a girl of ten, and they found their mother on the kitchen floor, her clothing partly removed, her body covered with stab wounds. They ran around the street screaming until the beat cop turned up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finding anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" I said. I copied down the name of the first cop on the scene, added those of two detectives from the Six-One who\u0027d gone to the Haring Street house before switching the case to Midtown North. I showed the three names to Antonelli. \"Any of these guys still work out of here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Patrolman Burton Havermeyer, Detective Third-Grade Kenneth Allgood, Detective First-Grade Michael Quinn. Mick Quinn died two, maybe three years ago. Line of duty. He and a partner had a liquor store staked out on Avenue W and there were shots exchanged and he was killed. Terrible thing. Lost a wife to cancer two years before that, so he left four kids all alone in the world, the oldest just starting college. You must have read about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guys who shot him pulled good long time. But they\u0027re alive and he\u0027s dead, so go figure. The other two, Allgood and Havermeyer, I don\u0027t even know the names, so they\u0027ve been off the Six-One since before my time, which is what? Five years? Something like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you find out where they went?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can probably find out something. What do you want to ask \u0027em, anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If she was stabbed in both eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wasn\u0027t there an M.E.\u0027s report in the file whats-his-name showed you? Fitzroy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"Both eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember that case some years ago? They pulled some woman out of the Hudson, called it death by drowning? Then some genius in the Medical Examiner\u0027s office took the skull and started using it for a paperweight, and there was a scandal about that, and because of all the heat somebody finally took a good look at the skull for the first time and found a bullet hole in it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember. She was some woman from New Jersey, married to a doctor, wasn\u0027t she?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got a rule-of-thumb. When a doctor\u0027s wife gets killed, he did it. I don\u0027t give a shit about the evidence. The doc always did it. I don\u0027t remember whether this one got off or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither do I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I take your point, though. The M.E.\u0027s report isn\u0027t something you want to run to the bank with. But how good is a witness to something that happened nine years ago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not too good. Still-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see what I can see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was gone a little longer this time, and he had a funny expression on his face when he returned. \"Bad luck case,\" he said. \"Allgood\u0027s dead, too. And the patrolman, Havermeyer, he left the department.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did Allgood die?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heart attack, about a year ago. He got transferred out a couple of years back. He was working out of Centre Street headquarters. Collapsed at his desk one day and died. One of the guys in the file room knew him from when he worked here and happened to know how he died. Havermeyer could be dead, too, for all I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"Who knows? He put in his papers just a few months after the Icepick thing. Cited unspecified personal reasons for returning to civilian life. He\u0027d only been in for two, three years. You know what the drop-out rate\u0027s like for the new ones. Hell, you\u0027re a drop-out yourself. Personal reasons, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dug up an address and a number. He probably moved six times between then and now. If he didn\u0027t leave a trail, you can always try downtown. He wasn\u0027t here long enough to have any pension rights but they usually keep track of ex-cops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he\u0027s still in the same place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could be. My grandmother\u0027s still living in three little rooms on Elizabeth Street, same apartment she\u0027s been in since she got off the boat from Palermo. Some people stay put. Others change their houses like they change their socks. Maybe you\u0027ll get lucky. Anything else I can do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Haring Street?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The murder scene?\" He laughed. \"Jesus, you\u0027re a bloodhound,\" he said. \"Want to get the scent, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe told me how to walk there. He\u0027d given me a fair amount of his time but he didn\u0027t want any money for it. I sensed that he probably didn\u0027t-some do and some don\u0027t-but I made the offer. \"You could probably use a new hat,\" I said, and he came back with a tight grin and assured me that he had a whole closetful of hats. \"And I hardly ever wear a hat these days,\" he said. I\u0027d been offering him twenty-five dollars, cheap enough for the effort he\u0027d expended. \"It\u0027s a slow day at a quiet precinct,\" he said, \"and how much mileage can you get out of what I just gave you? You got anybody in mind for that Boerum Hill killing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like hunting a black cat in a coal mine,\" he said. \"Do me one favor? Let me know how it comes out. If it comes out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed his directions to Haring Street. I don\u0027t suppose the neighborhood had changed much in nine years. The houses were well kept up and there were kids all over the place. There were cars parked at the curb, cars in most of the driveways. It occurred to me that there were probably a dozen people on the block who remembered Susan Potowski, and for all I knew her estranged husband had moved back into the house after the murder and lived there now with his children. They\u0027d be older now, seventeen and nineteen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe must have been young when she had the first one. Nineteen herself. Early marriage and early childbirth wouldn\u0027t have been uncommon in that neighborhood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe probably moved away, I decided. Assuming he came back for the kids, he wouldn\u0027t make them go on living in the house where they found their mother dead on the kitchen floor. Would he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t ring that doorbell, or any other doorbells. I wasn\u0027t investigating Susan Potowski\u0027s murder and I didn\u0027t have to sift her ashes. I took a last look at the house she\u0027d died in, then turned and walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE address I had for Burton Havermeyer was 212 St. Marks Place. The East Village wasn\u0027t that likely a place for a cop to live, and it didn\u0027t seem terribly likely that he\u0027d still be there nine years later, on or off the force. I called the number Antonelli had given me from a drugstore phone booth on Ocean Avenue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman answered. I asked if I could speak to Mr. Havermeyer. There was a pause. \"Mr. Havermeyer doesn\u0027t live here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to apologize for having the wrong number but she wasn\u0027t through. \"I don\u0027t know where Mr. Havermeyer can be reached,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this Mrs. Havermeyer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"I\u0027m sorry to disturb you, Mrs. Havermeyer. A detective at the Sixty-first Precinct where your husband used to work supplied this number. I\u0027m trying to-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My former husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a toneless quality to her speech, as if she was deliberately detaching herself from the words she was speaking. I had noted a similar characteristic in the speech of recovered mental patients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying to reach him in connection with a police matter,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He hasn\u0027t been a policeman in years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I realize that. Do you happen to know how I can get hold of him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I gather you don\u0027t see him often, Mrs. Havermeyer, but would you have any idea-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never see him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, do you? I never see my former husband. I get a check once a month. It\u0027s sent directly to my bank and deposited to my account. I don\u0027t see my husband and I don\u0027t see the check. Do you see? Do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words might have been delivered with passion. But the voice remained flat and uninvolved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s in Manhattan,\" she said. \"Perhaps he has a phone, and perhaps it\u0027s in the book. You could look it up. I know you\u0027ll excuse me if I don\u0027t offer to look it up for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure it\u0027s important,\" she said. \"Police business always is, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHERE was no Manhattan telephone book at the drugstore so I let the Information operator look for me. She found a Burton Havermeyer on West 103rd Street. I dialed the number and no one answered. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-stab-in-the-dark-matthew-scudder-4/page-13.html","bookId":2322,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:48:47 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:48:47 AM"}
