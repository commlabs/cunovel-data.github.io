The accusatory post had vanished from the message boards, but Simon remained paralysed. To withdraw his candidacy might seem like an admission of guilt. The police had not come knocking about the computer; Simon half regretted throwing it off the old bridge now. On the other hand, he could not decide whether he had imagined a knowing grin from the man behind the till when he handed over his credit card in the garage at the foot of the hill. There was a lot of talk about redundancies at work, and Simon was still afraid of the contents of that post coming to the bosses\u0027 ears, that they might save themselves redundancy pay by sacking himself, Jim and Tommy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrew watched and waited, losing hope every day. He had tried to show the world what his father was, and the world, it seemed, had merely shrugged. Andrew had imagined that someone from the printworks or the council would rise up and tell Simon firmly, \u0027no\u0027; that he was not fit to set himself up in competition with other people, that he was unsuitable and sub-standard, and must not disgrace himself or his family. Yet nothing had happened, except that Simon stopped talking about the council or making telephone calls in the hope of garnering votes, and the leaflets that he had had printed out of hours at work sat untouched in a box in the porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, without warning or fanfare, came victory. Heading down the dark stairs in search of food on Friday evening, Andrew heard Simon talking stiffly on the telephone in the sitting room, and paused to listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027... withdraw my candidacy,\u0027 he was saying. \u0027Yes. Well, my personal circumstances have changed. Yes. Yes. Yeah, that\u0027s right. OK. Thank you.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrew heard Simon replace the receiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well, that\u0027s that,\u0027 his father said to his mother. \u0027I\u0027m well out of it, if that\u0027s the kind of shit they\u0027re throwing around.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard his mother return some muffled, approving rejoinder, and before Andrew had time to move, Simon had emerged into the hall below, drawn breath into his lungs and yelled the first syllable of Andrew\u0027s name, before realizing that his son was right in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What are you doing?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon\u0027s face was half in shadow, lit only by the light escaping the sitting room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I wanted a drink,\u0027 Andrew lied; his father did not like the boys helping themselves to food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You start work with Mollison this weekend, don\u0027t you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yeah.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Right, well, you listen to me. I want anything you can get on that bastard, d\u0027you hear me? All the dirt you can get. And on his son, if you hear anything.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027All right,\u0027 said Andrew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And I\u0027ll put it up on the fucking website for them,\u0027 said Simon, and he walked back into the sitting room. \u0027Barry Fairbrother\u0027s fucking ghost.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he scavenged an assortment of food that might not be missed, skimming off slices here, handfuls there, a jubilant jingle ran through Andrew\u0027s mind: I stopped you, you bastard. I stopped you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had done exactly what he had set out to do: Simon had no idea who had brought his ambitions to dust. The silly sod was even demanding Andrew\u0027s help in getting his revenge; a complete about-turn, because when Andrew had first told his parents that he had a job at the delicatessen, Simon had been furious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You stupid little tit. What about your fucking allergy?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I thought I\u0027d try not eating any of the nuts,\u0027 said Andrew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t get smart with me, Pizza Face. What if you eat one accidentally, like at St Thomas\u0027s? D\u0027you think we want to go through that crap again?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Ruth had supported Andrew, telling Simon that Andrew was old enough to take care, to know better. When Simon had left the room, she had tried to tell Andrew that Simon was only worried about him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The only thing he\u0027s worried about is that he\u0027d have to miss bloody Match of the Day to take me to hospital.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrew returned to his bedroom, where he sat shovelling food into his mouth with one hand and texting Fats with the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought that it was all over, finished, done with. Andrew had never yet had reason to observe the first tiny bubble of fermenting yeast, in which was contained an inevitable, alchemical transformation. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-casual-vacancy/page-24.html","bookId":2230,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:10:31 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:10:31 PM"}
