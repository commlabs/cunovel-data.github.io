I felt I held the key to cracking the Case of the Missing Twin Teen Vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, an empty garage was an awesome hiding place for a vampire. If a family were on vacation, they would have to drive the hour and a half to the nearest airport, therefore giving vacancy to a waiting coffin. With no one in the residence, Jagger and Luna could go undetected long enough to seduce Trevor into their vampirey lair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Alexander and I walked from garage door to garage door, it could take decades to discover which one Jagger and Luna were calling their latest batcave. By then Trevor would be \"fluless\" and return to practice in enough time for Luna to have sunk her fangs into him and the entire Dullsville High soccer team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hardly spoke to anyone in this town, much less knew the travel plans of the other Dullsvillians. I had to figure out a way to find out who was traveling, their destinations, and the durations of their stays. How could I get access to that information? Just then an idea struck me like a bolt of lightning. Of course I couldn\u0027t get the information-- but I knew someone who could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day, after school, Becky drove me to the Armstrong Travel Agency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI missed the old girl. Since she\u0027d begun dating Matt Wells and I\u0027d met Alexander, we didn\u0027t have the endless free time to hang out, talk on the phone, or climb the Mansion\u0027s gates. So when we did have girl time, we made the most of it. \"I\u0027ve heard rumors about that white-haired girl from Romania,\" she said when I got into her truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you hear?\" I asked, perking up after a long, mind- numbing school day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that dude that was lurking at the drive-in when we saw Kissing Coffins was her brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes...,\" I began, hinting for more info.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matt says they\u0027ve been asking around for Trevor. I think the dude wants to play on the soccer team, but he doesn\u0027t even go to our school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it?\" I asked, disappointed. \"I wouldn\u0027t worry about it. No one will take Matt\u0027s position away. Not even a vampire,\" I mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you say?\" she asked as she pulled the pickup in front of Armstrong Travel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped out of the truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure you and Alexander aren\u0027t going to elope in Romania?\" Becky teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but if we do, I\u0027ll get four tickets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was happy to walk into Armstrong Travel in full goth garb-- Herman Munster-size black boots, purple tights, and a black torn T- shirt dress-- instead of their Corporate Cathy dress code of tailored skirts and blouses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled at Ruby, who was seated at her desk, handing pamphlets to two customers. Ruby\u0027s friendly expression strained as I stood like an ill-mannered eyesore in the very conservative business. \"I\u0027ll be right with you,\" Ruby said, hinting at an out-of-the-way chair behind a rack of luggage tags.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just browsing,\" I said, and began glancing at a map of Hawaii.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally the young couple with Mexico brochures in their hands rose. They looked at me oddly, then cowered past, as if at any moment my bat body tattoo was going to jump off my arm and bite their heads off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll call you to confirm,\" Ruby said with a wave as the couple scurried out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Raven, it\u0027s great to see you,\" she greeted sincerely. \"What brings you by?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Janice in?\" I asked, secretly hoping she wasn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, she\u0027s at the post office. Is there something I can help you with?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...has anyone in town booked a vacation in the last few days?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People book vacations every day. This is a travel agency, you know,\" she said with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would you want to know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, there are these two teen vampires who are hiding out in town, waiting for the right moment to bite Trevor Mitchell. I believe they are living in a vacant garage, probably belonging to a vacationer, I wanted to say. I imagined Ruby\u0027s pleasant face turning to shock, then horror, then her plugging away at her keyboard for a list of addresses. \"You go, Raven Madison. Save Dullsville. Save the world.\" \"Uh...for a school report,\" I said instead. \"I\u0027m doing statistics on spring vacations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, hon, but I can\u0027t give out that information. You ought to know that; you worked here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s precisely the reason I thought you\u0027d tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d love to help, but I just can\u0027t give out names, addresses, and itineraries,\" she said with a laugh. \"In the wrong hands that information could be used for home invasions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or at least garages,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby appeared confused just as the phone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Armstrong Travel, Ruby speaking. Can I help you make a reservation?\" she said in an ultra-perky voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fiddled with the white pens on her desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, let me see,\" she said, and began plugging away at her computer keyboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang again, this time lighting up line two of Ruby\u0027s white phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I put you on hold?\" Ruby asked. \"Oh...you are calling from where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the red light flashed and the phone continued to ring, I spun Ruby\u0027s lucite organizer and wondered how I could hack into their computer without the FBI finding out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby covered the receiver with her hand. \"Do you mind answering that?\" she asked, pointing to Janice\u0027s phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho did she think I was? I didn\u0027t work here anymore, and I most certainly wasn\u0027t on the clock. I went to Janice\u0027s desk, pressed line two, and picked up the phone. \"Armstrong Travel, where Spain is hot and the men are hotter. Can I book you a trip there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have any specials on cruises?\" a woman\u0027s voice asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Janice?\" I said. \"Janice, is that you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby glanced over at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, my name isn\u0027t Janice,\" the caller answered. \"It\u0027s Liz. I\u0027m interested in a vacation cruise to Alaska.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keys?\" I asked loud enough for Ruby to hear. \"You need car keys?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Liz corrected. \"I said \u0027cruise.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby looked over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re at the post office? Your cell is breaking up. You need Ruby to pick you up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you said this was Armstrong Travel,\" Liz said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me talk,\" Ruby said to me. \"Excuse me,\" she said politely to her caller, \"I need to put you on hold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, I must have the wrong number,\" the inquiring Liz said, and hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby switched lines just as line two\u0027s red light went dead. \"Janice? Janice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her cell kept dropping, then went dead. Maybe it wasn\u0027t her--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, she\u0027s been frazzled all day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby hurried over to her business partner\u0027s desk and found a spare set of keys in her top drawer. \"Do you mind riding these over to the post office for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis plan wasn\u0027t for me to leave. Ruby was making this difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have my bike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have your driver\u0027s license?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have my temps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby glanced at me, then outside at her white Mercedes parked in front of the agency. I could see her mind race as she imagined me screeching down the street, blasting Marilyn Manson, and returning her car with newly painted black widow spiders running alongside the exterior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have to close the agency,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...,\" I began, twisting a lock of hair. \"I could watch the office, if that would help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really aren\u0027t dressed appropriately,\" she said, eyeing my morose-looking outfit. \"But I guess I don\u0027t have a choice. You wouldn\u0027t mind staying here for just a few minutes? I hate to close the agency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t be long, really,\" she said, gathering her purse and keys. \"It would be a big help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will I be paid the same rate as before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paid?\" she asked with her hand on her hip. \"I\u0027ll only be gone for a few minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about throwing in a few plane tickets, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlustered, Ruby paused. \"I\u0027ll give you ten dollars and a coupon for a free movie.\" \"Deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You drive a hard bargain. That\u0027s what I\u0027ve always liked about you,\" she said as she raced out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat at Ruby\u0027s desk. I flipped through a Conde Nast magazine until I saw her get in her white Mercedes and drive off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that I was employed again, even if only for twenty minutes, it was part of my job to be informed. I logged on to her computer using the same password I had when I was in her employ. \u0026amp;#65533; Within moments I was surfing through the itineraries of vacationing Dullsvillians. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampireville-vampire-kisses-3/page-5.html","bookId":1868,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:07 PM"}
