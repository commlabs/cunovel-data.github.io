The damned fool at her side was going to get himself killed, and she would be made responsible for that failure to protect him. K’risnan and Arapay bodyguards would achieve nothing. The Factor’s agents infected every Letherii legion on this march, and among those agents… Errant-damned assassins. Masters of the Poison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe liked this warrior at her side, dour as he was-which seemed a trait of the Tiste Edur in any case. And though clearly intelligent, he was also… naive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was clear that Letur Anict had penetrated the pathetic unofficial efforts of Brohl Handar and a half-dozen other overseers, and the Factor intended to eliminate this nascent threat here and now. On this very expedition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We have a problem with Brohl Handar,’ the Factor had said, his pale round face looking like dusty stone in the habitual gloom of his inner sanctum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sir?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Unsanctioned, he seeks to exceed his responsibilities, and in so doing undermine the traditional functions of a factor in a border province. His ambitions have drawn others into his web, which could, alas, have fatal repercussions.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Fatal? How?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Atri-Preda, I must tell you. No longer are the Patriotists focusing exclusively on the Letherii in the empire. There has come to light evidence of an emerging conspiracy among the Tiste Edur-against the state, possibly against the Emperor himself.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbsurd. Do you truly take me for such a fool, Anict? Against the state and against the Emperor are two different things. The state is you and people like you. The state is the Liberty Consign and the Patriotists. The state is the Chancellor and his cronies. Against them, the notion of a conspiracy among the Tiste Edur to rid the empire of Letherii corruption seemed more than plausible. They had been occupiers long enough to come to understand the empire they had won; to begin to realize that a far more subtle conquest had taken place, of which they were the losers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tiste Edur were, above all else, a proud people. Not likely to abide defeat, and the fact that the victors were, by j their measure, cowards in the true sense of the term would sting all the more. So she was not surprised that Brohl Handar and his fellow Edur had at last begun a campaign of eradication against the Letherii running the state. Not surprising, either, the extent to which the Edur have underestimated their enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sir, I am an officer in the Imperial Army. My I commander is the Emperor himself.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Emperor rules us all, Atri-Preda,’ Letur Anict had said with a faint smile. ‘The conspiracy among his kind directly threatens his loyal support structure-those who endeavour, at great personal sacrifice, to maintain that apparatus.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘People such as yourself.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Indeed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What are you asking of me, sir?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Brohl Handar will insist on accompanying your punitive expedition. I believe it is his intent to claim territories reconquered for himself’-a wave of one hand-‘no doubt in the name of the empire or some such meaningless nonsense.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou mean, as you have done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I will try to talk him out of it,’ she said. ‘It’s not safe-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Indeed it isn’t. Precisely my point.’ After a moment, Letur Anict leaned back. ‘You will, alas, not win your argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Overseer will march with you, accepting the risks.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe risks, yes. Imagining they come from the Awl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I will do all I can to preserve his life,’ Bivatt said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA spread of hands. ‘Of course. That is your duty, and we both know how treacherous the Awl can be, especially as they are now commanded by none other than Redmask. Who can say what dread ambushes he has contrived to spring upon you, with the principal aim of murdering commanders and other important personages. Indeed, Atri-Preda, you have your duty and I would expect no less from you. But I do remind you, Brohl Handar is engaged in treason.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then have Orbyn Truthfinder arrest him.’ If he dares, for that will bring it all out into the open, and you’re not ready for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We will,’ the Factor then said, ‘be prepared for his return.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo soon? ‘Has the Emperor been informed of these developments, sir?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He has. The Patriotists would not be engaged in this hunt were it not so-I am sure you understand that, Atri-Preda.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe believed she did. Even Karos Invictad would not proceed without some sort of sanction. ‘Is that all, sir?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It is. Errant smile on your hunt, Atri-Preda.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-110.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
