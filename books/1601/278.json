You cannot win\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn’t listen to me\", Lan whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne last lesson. The hardest . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemandred struck, and Lan saw his opening. Lan lunged forward, placing Demandred’s sword point against his own side and ramming himself forward onto it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not come here to win\", Lan whispered, smiling. \"I came here to kill you. Death is lighter than a feather\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemandred\u0027s eyes opened wide, and he tried to pull back. Too late. Lan’s sword took him straight through the throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world grew dark as Lan slipped backward off the sword. He felt Nynaeve\u0027s fear and pain as he did, and he sent his love to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 38\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Place That Was Not\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand saw Lan fall, and it sent a spasm of anguish through him. The Dark One pressed in around Rand. Swallowing him, shredding him. Fighting that attack was too hard. Rand was spent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet go. His fathers voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to save them . . \". Rand whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet them sacrifice. You can’t do this yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to . . . That’s what it means . . \". The Dark One’s destruction crawled on him like a thousand crows, picking at his flesh, pulling it from his bones. He could barely think through the pressure and the sense of loss. The death of Egwene and so many others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is their choice to make.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted so badly to protect them, the people who believed in him. Their deaths, and the danger they faced, were an enormous weight upon him. How could a man just . . . let go? Wasn’t that letting go of responsibility?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr was it giving the responsibility to them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand squeezed his eyes shut, thinking of all those who had died for him. Of Egwene, whom he had sworn to himself to protect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou fool. Her voice in his head. Fond, but sharp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Egwene?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAm I not allowed to be a hero, too?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It’s not that . \".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou march to your death. Yet you forbid anyone else from doing so?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I . . \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet go, Rand. Let us die for what we believe, and do not try to steal that from us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have embraced your death. Embrace mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears leaked from the corners of his eyes. \"I’m sorry\", he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’ve failed\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. Not yet you haven’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dark One flayed him. He huddled before that vast nothingness, unable to move. He screamed in agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, he let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let go of the guilt. He let go of the shame for having not saved Egwene and all the others. He let go of the need to protect her, to protect all of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let them be heroes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNames streamed from his head. Egwene, Hurin, Bashere, Isan of the Chareen Aiel, Somara and thousands more. One by one—first slowly, but with increasing speed—he counted backward through the list he had once maintained in his head. The list had once been only women, but had grown to include everyone he knew had died for him. He hadn’t realized how large it had become, how much he had let himself carry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe names ripped from him like physical things, like doves aflight, and each one carried away a burden. Weight vanished from his shoulders. His breathing grew steadier. It was as if Perrin had come with his hammer and shattered a thousand chains that had been dragging behind Rand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIlyena was last. We are reborn, Rand thought, so we can do better the next time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo do better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his eyes and placed his hand before him, palm against blackness that felt solid. His self that had fuzzed, becoming indistinct as the Dark One ripped at it, pulled together. He placed his other arm down, then heaved himself to his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, Rand al’Thor—the Dragon Reborn—stood up once again to face the Shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no\", the beautiful Shendla whispered, looking down at Demandred’s body. Her heart sank down inside of her and she tore at her hair with both hands, her body swaying. As she gazed on her beloved, Shendla slowly drew breath deep into her chest, and when it released, it was a fearful shriek: \"Bao the Wyld is dead!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire battlefield seemed to grow still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand faced the Dark One in that place that was not, surrounded by all time and nothing at the same time. His body still stood in the cave of Shayol Ghul, locked into that moment of battle against Moridin, but his soul was here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe existed in this place that was not, this place outside of the Pattern, this place where evil was born. He looked into it, and he knew it. The Dark One was not a being, but a force—an essence as wide as the universe itself, which Rand could now see in complete detail. Planets, stars in their multitudes, like the motes above a bonfire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dark One still strove to destroy him. Rand felt strong despite the attacks. Relaxed, complete. With his burdens gone, he could fight again. He held himself together. It was difficult, but he was victorious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand stepped forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Darkness shuddered. It quivered, vibrated, as if disbelieving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI DESTROY THEM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dark One was not a being. It was the darkness between. Between lights, between moments, between eyeblinks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eALL IS MINE THIS TIME. IT WAS EVER MEANT TO BE. IT WILL EVER BE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand saluted those who died. The blood running across rocks. The weeping of those who witnessed others fall. The Shadow threw all of it at Rand, intent on Rand\u0027s destruction. But it did not destroy him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will never give in\", Rand whispered. \"I will never give in\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vast Shadow thundered and shook. It sent jolts through and across the world. The ground rent, the laws of nature fractured. Swords turned against their owners, food spoiled, rock turned to mud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came upon Rand again, the force of nothingness itself trying to pull him apart. The strength of the attack did not lessen. And yet, suddenly, it felt like an idle buzzing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey would not give up. It wasn’t just about Rand. All of them would keep fighting. The Dark One’s attacks lost meaning. If they could not make him yield, if they could not make him relent, then what were they?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the tempest, Rand sought the void as Tam had taught him. All emotion, all worry, all pain. He took it and fed it into the \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-278.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
