It\u0027s the first time he\u0027s made eye contact with the kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe policeman is a kid - hell, even I can tell he\u0027s barely out of the academy. I can see that from where I\u0027m looking out, three houses away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No questions, nothin\u0027 at all?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCopper spits again, looks from the man in uniform doing nothing, to the men in uniform across the street, also doing nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027This is the sixth house they\u0027ve gutted in this neighborhood. \u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes, sir, we appreciate your calling it in.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I seen it all and I called it in - twenty-six hours ago.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCopper lets that one stand. He tilts his head, cocking his neck, staring the policeman down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ve called in every goddamned one of \u0027em.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can see the white of the cop\u0027s scalp when he looks away from the old man\u0027s glare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid clears his throat and looks down, as if there were something of importance in his hand. He already closed his notebook. What can there be to look at? He doesn\u0027t even have calluses to gander at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027City just doesn\u0027t care, does it?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid\u0027s crew cut is too close, like a fresh military cut. His scalp gleams like a baby\u0027s knee. This kid is green, the type that needs a weekly trim and says so, as if that were part and parcel of being a cop, to make up for doing nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But come tax reassessment time, the city is right at my door.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course they send him to talk to Copper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ve got one question, officer.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027s that, Mr Cyrus?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027re you going to do when they come after my house?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf there is a reply, he doesn\u0027t stay long enough to hear it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screen door slaps closed without a whisper from the hinges. Copper keeps everything shipshape; no squeaking door on his watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn\u0027t matter. The cop is on his heel and away, too. His polished shoes are too smart on the tarmac; the crease of his pantlegs are sharp as a paper cut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head and mutters something I can\u0027t make out, and his cop cronies make some wisecrack back at him, and they all have a hearty laugh at Copper\u0027s expense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnything to clear the air of the old man\u0027s comment, ignore the truth of it, pretend it wasn\u0027t said or heard or didn\u0027t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lay low and watch the old man\u0027s porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dream of Mount McKinley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dream of fucking, and climbing, and cold, and pain and cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dream of my dick splitting in half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wake up on the bare cement floor in the basement of the Baker house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear Fetus moving around upstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand up.

Damn near every house looted, gutted, no electricity, no running water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look past the row of shells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery house on this street is abandoned but one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s the same for blocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA neighborhood of shells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWindows boarded up, sheets of plywood over doorways, broken panes, sagging clapboards, chipping paint, ragged shingles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll but one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see Copper across the way and up the street, sitting on his porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCopper sits on his rocker on his porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember I have something to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027So what you want from me?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCopper sits on his rocker on his porch, still as a stump. One spot- flecked hand over his other wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s an odd position, and he changes hands to cup the opposite wrist, if you are with him long enough to notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCopper later tells me that\u0027s how the cold hits him: it stabs his wrists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis wrists get cold, a deep cold that starts slow before it bites to the marrow and lingers. \u0027Started when I was in my mid fifties,\u0027 he later says, \u0027and the damned thing is, it\u0027s same as when I was in Korea. Same cold, as if I\u0027d never left it. Like it followed me here.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that is later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, he sits with one hand over t\u0027other, over the wrist, and gazes at me with those milky blue eyes of his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027re here all the time,\u0027 I say. \u0027I see you keeping watch.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns his head and spits without taking his hand off that wrist. Over the rail it goes, a shimmering clam arcing into the perfectly trimmed grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yep, I\u0027m home, always home. What of it?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027So, we\u0027re looking to start a neighborhood watch.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes don\u0027t so much as quiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips are tight, white, top and bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Keep an eye on one another\u0027s houses, watch out for one another,\u0027 I offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m home.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother lunger over the rail, into the perfect green grass, somehow without breaking gaze with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Always home.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes, sir.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe let that hang in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe let it hang a while, let it slide to quiet and seep in, like his spit on the blade of grass below is hanging then seeping, though I can\u0027t say for sure it is or does, as I\u0027m watching Copper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCopper doesn\u0027t move a notch, and he won\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp to me, since I\u0027m the one intruding, to break the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Since you keep an eye out, it seemed-\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout breaking the gaze, another lunger, over the rail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough his milky blues don\u0027t so much as shift, I can tell he\u0027s sizing me up - seeing if I break the stare to track his lunger, to see if it\u0027s green as the green-green St Patty\u0027s Day grass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCopper\u0027s lawn is perfect, always perfect, the only cut and green lawn on the block, and Copper\u0027s lungers won\u0027t change that a whit. His eyes stay icy, but I can tell he\u0027s a bit amused by all this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat they say, clear as crystal, is what he won\u0027t say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027-you know, we watch out for one another.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe says it later, just to clear the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, when we get to know one another a bit, when we are in the basement waiting for T.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, when he tells me about how the cold sunk its choppers into his wrists, about Korea, about \u0027Nam before it was \u0027Nam, about his wife Becca before she was gone, about his calico cat Hank before T took Hank down into the cellar and did the deed, before all that shit hit all those fans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe says later what his eyes say now loud and clear, and I hear just fine. He says it later just to make sure there are no hard feelings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do I need you for? What do I need you to watch out for me or mine for? What could you possibly offer me that I don\u0027t already do or have done or was or am or will be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m home, always home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, he says all that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot now, not on the porch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe says, \u0027I remember you, kid.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You lived over on Spruce and James.
