Some People Just Don\u0027t Grasp The Concept Of \"Unwelcome\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was right on the edge of sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun had risen behind the clouds an hour ago - the forest was gray now instead of black. Seth\u0027d curled up and passed out around one, and I\u0027d woken him at dawn to trade off. Even after running all night, I was having a hard time making my brain shut up long enough to fall asleep, but Seth\u0027s rhythmic run was helping. One, two-three, four, one, two-three, four - dum dum-dum dam - dull paw thuds against the damp earth, over and over as he made the wide circuit surrounding the Cullens\u0027 land. We were already wearing a trail into the ground. Seth\u0027s thoughts were empty, just a blur of green and gray as the woods flew past him. It was restful. It helped to fill my head with what he saw rather than letting my own images take center stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Seth\u0027s piercing howl broke the early morning quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lurched up from the ground, my front legs pulling toward a sprint before my hind legs were off the ground. I raced toward the place where Seth had frozen, listening with him to the tread of paws running in our direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorning, boys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shocked whine broke through Seth\u0027s teeth. And then we both snarled as we read deeper into the new thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, man! Goaway, Leah! Seth groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped when I got to Seth, head thrown back, ready to howl again - this time to complain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCut the noise, Seth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight. Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!He whimpered and pawed at the ground, scratching deep furrows in the dirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeah trotted into view, her small gray body weaving through the underbrush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStop whining, Seth. You\u0027re such a baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI growled at her, my ears flattening against my skull. She skipped back a step automatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you think you\u0027re doing, Leah?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe huffed a heavy sigh. It\u0027s pretty obvious, isn\u0027t it? I\u0027m joining your crappy little renegade pack. The vampires\u0027 guard dogs. She barked out a low, sarcastic laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, you\u0027re not. Turn around before I rip out one of your hamstrings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike you could catch me.She grinned and coiled her body for launch. Wanna race, O fearless leader?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath, filling my lungs until my sides bulged. Then, when I was sure I wasn\u0027t going to scream, i exhaled in a gust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth, go let the Cullens know that it\u0027s just your stupid sister - thought the words as harshly as possible. deal with this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn it!Seth was only too happy to leave. He vanished toward the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeah whined, and she leaned after him, the fur on her shoulders rising. You\u0027re just going to let him run off to the vampires alone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m pretty sure he\u0027d rather they took him out than spend another minute with you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShut up, Jacob. Oops, I\u0027m sorry - meant, shut up, most high Alpha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy thehellare you here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou think I\u0027m just going to sit home while my little brother volunteers as a vampire chew toy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth doesn\u0027t want or need your protection. In fact, no one wants you here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOooh, ouch, that\u0027s gonna leave ahuge mark. Ha, she barked. Tell me who does want me around, and I\u0027m outta here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo this isn\u0027t about Seth at all, is it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course it is. I\u0027m just pointing out that being unwanted is not a first for me. Not really a motivating factor, if you know what I mean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gritted my teeth and tried to get my head straight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid Sam send you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I was here on Sam\u0027s errand, you wouldn\u0027t be able to hear me. My allegiance is no longer with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI listened carefully to the thoughts mixed in with the words. If this was a diversion or a ploy, I had to be alert enough to see through it. But there was nothing. Her declaration was nothing but the truth. Unwilling, almost despairing truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re loyal tome now? I asked with deep sarcasm. Uh-huh. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy choices are limited. I\u0027m working with the options I\u0027ve got. Trust me, I\u0027m not enjoying this any more than you are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat wasn\u0027t true. There was an edgy kind of excitement in her mind. She was unhappy about this, but she was also riding some weird high. I searched her mind, trying to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bristled, resenting the intrusion. I usually tried to tune Leah out - I\u0027d never tried to make sense of her before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were interrupted by Seth, thinking his explanation at Edward. Leah whined anxiously. Edward\u0027s face, framed in the same window as last night, showed no reaction to the news. It was a blank face, dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow, he looks bad,Seth muttered to himself. The vampire showed no reaction to that thought, either. He disappeared into the house. Seth pivoted and headed back out to us. Leah relaxed a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0027s going on?Leah asked. Catch me up to speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s no point You\u0027re not staying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, Mr. Alpha, I am. Because since apparently I have to belong tosomeone - and don\u0027t think I haven\u0027t tried breaking off on my own, you know yourself how wellthat doesn \u0027t work - choose you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeah, you don\u0027t like me. I don\u0027t like you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you, Captain Obvious. That doesn\u0027t matter to me. I\u0027m staying with Seth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don\u0027t like vampires. Don\u0027t you think that\u0027s a little conflict of interest right there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don\u0027t like vampires either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Iam committed to this alliance. You aren\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll keep my distance from them. I can run patrols out here, just like Seth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I\u0027m supposed to trust you with that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stretched her neck, leaning up on her toes, trying to be as tall as me as she stared into my eyes. will not betray my pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to throw my head back and howl, like Seth had before. This isn\u0027t your pack! This isn\u0027t even a pack. This is just me, going off on my own! What is it with you Clearwaters? Why can\u0027t you leave me alone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth, just coming up behind us now, whined; I\u0027d offended him. Great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve been helpful, haven\u0027t I, Jake?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou haven\u0027t madetoo much a nuisance of yourself, kid, but if you and Leah are a package deal - if the only way to get rid of her is for you to go home.... Weil, can you blame me for wanting you gone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUgh, Leah, you ruin everything!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, I know,she told him, and the thought was loaded with the heaviness of her despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt the pain in the three little words, and it was more than I would\u0027ve guessed. I didn\u0027t want to feel that. I didn\u0027t want to feel bad for her. Sure, the pack was rough on her, but she brought it all on herself with the bitterness that tainted her every thought and made being in her head a nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth was feeling guilty, too. Jake... You\u0027re not really gonna send me away, are you? Leah\u0027s not so bad. Really. I mean, with her here, we can push the perimeter out farther. And this puts Sam down to seven. There\u0027s no way he\u0027s going to mount an attack that outnumbered. It\u0027s probably a good thing....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know I don\u0027t want to lead a pack, Seth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo don\u0027t lead us,Leah offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted. Sounds perfect to me. Run along home now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake,Seth thought. belong here. I do like vampires. Cullens, anyway. They\u0027re people to me, and I\u0027m going to protect them, \u0027cause that\u0027s what we\u0027re supposed to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe you belong, kid, but your sister doesn\u0027t And she\u0027s going to go wherever you are -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped short, because I saw something when I said that. Something Leah had been trying not to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeah wasn\u0027t going anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThought this was about Seth,I thought sourly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flinched. Of course I\u0027m here for Seth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd to get away from Sam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer jaw clenched. don\u0027t have to explain myself to you. I just have to do what I\u0027m told. I belong to your pack, Jacob. The end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paced away from her, growling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrap. I was never going to get rid of her. As much as she disliked me, as much as she loathed the Cullens, as happy as she\u0027d be to go kill all the vampires right now, as much as it pissed her off to have to protect them instead - none of that was anything compared to what she felt being free of Sam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeah didn\u0027t like me, so it wasn\u0027t such a chore having me wish she would disappear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe loved Sam. Still. And having him wish she would disappear was more pain than she was willing to live with, now that she had a choice. She would have taken any other option. Even if it meant moving in with the Cullens as their lapdog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edon\u0027t know if I\u0027d go that far, she thought. She tried to make the words tough, aggressive, but there were big cracks in her show. I\u0027m sure I\u0027d give killing myself a few good tries first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook, Leah...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo,you look, Jacob. Stop arguing with me, because it\u0027s not going to do any good. I\u0027ll stay out of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyour way, okay? I\u0027ll do anything you want Except go back to Sam\u0027s pack and be the pathetic ex-girlfriend he can\u0027t get away from. If you want me to leave - she sat back on her haunches and stared straight into my eyes - you\u0027re going to have tomake me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snarled for a long, angry minute. I was beginning to feel some sympathy for Sam, despite what he had done to me, to Seth. No wonder he was always ordering the pack around. How else would you ever get anything done?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth, are you gonna get mad at me if I kill your sister?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pretended to think about it for a minute. Well... yeah, probably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, then, Ms. Do-Anything-I-Want Why don\u0027t you make yourself useful by telling us what you know? What happened after we left last night?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLots of howling. But you probably heard that part. It was so loud that it took us a while to figure out that we couldn\u0027t hear either of you anymore. Sam was...Words failed her, but we could see it in our head. Both Seth and I cringed. After that, it was clear pretty quick that we were going to have to rethink things. Sam was planning to talk to the other\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElders first thing this morning. We were supposed to meet up and figure out a game plan. I could tell he wasn\u0027t going to mount another attack right away, though. Suicide at this point, with you and Seth AWOL and the bloodsuckers forewarned. I\u0027m not sure what they\u0027ll do, but I wouldn\u0027t be wandering the forest alone if I was a leech. It\u0027s open season on vamps now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou decided to skip the meeting this morning?I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we split up for patrols last night, I asked permission to go home, to tell my mother what had happened -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrap! You told Mom?Seth growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth, hold off on the sibling stuff for a sec. Go on, Leah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo once I was human, I took a minute to think things through. Well, actually, I took all night. I bet the others think I fell asleep. But the whole two-separate-packs, two-separate-pack-minds thing gave mea lot to sift through. In the end, I weighed Seth\u0027s safety and the, er, other benefits against the idea of turning traitor and sniffing vampire stink for who knows how long. You know what I decided. I left a note for my mom. I expect we\u0027ll hear it when Sam finds out . ..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeah cocked an ear to the west.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, I expect we will,I agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that\u0027s everything. What do we do now?she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and Seth both looked at me expectantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was exactly the kind of thing I didn\u0027t want to have to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eguess we just keep an eye out for now. That\u0027s all we can do. You should probably take a nap, Leah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ve had as much sleep as I have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThought you were going to do what you were told?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight. That\u0027s going to get old,she grumbled, and then she yawned. Well, whatever. I don\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll run the border, Jake. I\u0027m not tired at all.Seth was so glad I hadn\u0027t forced them home, he was all but prancing with excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure, sure. I\u0027m going to go check in with the Cullens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeth took off along the new path worn into the damp earth. Leah looked after him thoughtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe a round or two before I crash.... Hey Seth, wanna see how many times I can lap you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNO!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarking out a low chuckle, Leah lunged into the woods after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI growled uselessly. So much for peace and quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeah was trying - for Leah. She kept her jibes to a minimum as she raced around the circuit, but it was impossible not to be aware of her smug mood. I thought of the whole \"two\u0027s company\" saying. It didn\u0027t really apply, because one was plenty to my mind. But if there had to be three of us, it was hard to think of anyone that I wouldn\u0027t trade her for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul?she suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe,I allowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed to herself, too jittery and hyper to get offended, i wondered how long the buzz from dodging Sam\u0027s pity would last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat will be my goal then - to be less annoying than Paul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, work on that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI changed into my other form when I was a few yards from the lawn. I hadn\u0027t been planning to spend much time human here. But I hadn\u0027t been planning to have Leah in my head, either. I pulled on my ragged shorts and started across the lawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened before I got to the steps, and I was surprised to see Carlisle rather than Edward step outside to meet me - his face looked exhausted and defeated. For a second, my heart froze. I faltered to a stop, unable to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right, Jacob?\" Carlisle asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Bella?\" I choked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s... much the same as last night. Did I startle you? I\u0027m sorry. Edward said you were coming in your human form, and I came out to greet you, as he didn\u0027t want to leave her. She\u0027s awake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Edward didn\u0027t want to lose any time with her, because he didn\u0027t have much time left. Carlisle didn\u0027t say the words out loud, but he might as well have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been a while since I\u0027d slept - since before my last patrol. I could really feel that now. I took a step forward, sat down on the porch steps, and slumped against the railing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving whisper-quiet as only a vampire could, Carlisle took a seat on the same step, against the other railing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t get a chance to thank you last night, Jacob. You don\u0027t know how much I appreciate your... compassion. I know your goal was to protect Bella, but I owe you the safety of the rest of my family as well. Edward told me what you had to do___\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t mention it,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you prefer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sat in silence. I could hear the others in the house. Emmett, Alice, and Jasper, speaking in low, serious voices upstairs. Esme humming tunelessly in another room. Rosalie and Edward breathing close by - I couldn\u0027t tell which was which, but I could hear the difference in Bella\u0027s labored panting. I could hear her heart, too. It seemed... uneven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like fate was out to make me do everything I\u0027d ever sworn I wouldn\u0027t in the course of twenty-four hours. Here I was, hanging around, waiting for her to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to listen anymore. Talking was better than listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s family to you?\" I asked Carlisle. It had caught my notice before, when he\u0027d said I\u0027d helped the rest of his family, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Bella is already a daughter to me. A beloved daughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you\u0027re going to let her die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was quiet long enough that I looked up. His face was very, very tired. I knew how he felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can imagine what you think of me for that,\" he finally said. \"But i can\u0027t ignore her will. It wouldn\u0027t be right to make such a choice for her, to force her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to be angry with him, but he was making it hard. It was like he was throwing my own words back at me, just scrambled up. They\u0027d sounded right before, but they couldn\u0027t be right now. Not with Bella dying. Still... I remembered how it felt to be broken on the ground under Sam - to have no choice but be involved in the murder of someone I loved. It wasn\u0027t the same, though. Sam was wrong. And Bella loved things she shouldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think there\u0027s any chance she\u0027ll make it? I mean, as a vampire and all that. She told me about...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout Esme.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTel say there\u0027s an even chance at this point,\" he answered quietly. \"I\u0027ve seen vampire venom work miracles, but there are conditions that even venom cannot overcome. Her heart is working too hard now; if it should fail... there won\u0027t be anything for me to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella\u0027s heartbeat throbbed and faltered, giving an agonizing emphasis to his words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe the planet had started turning backward. Maybe that would explain how everything was the opposite of what it had been yesterday - how I could be hoping for what had once seemed like the very worst thing in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is that thing doing to her?\" I whispered. \"She was so much worse last night. I saw... the tubes and all that. Through the window.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fetus isn\u0027t compatible with her body. Too strong, for one thing, but she could probably endure that for a while. The bigger problem is that it won\u0027t allow her to get the sustenance she needs. Her body is rejecting every form of nutrition. I\u0027m trying to feed her intravenously, but she\u0027s just not absorbing it. Everything about her condition is accelerated. I\u0027m watching her - and not just her, but the fetus as well - starve to death by the hour. I can\u0027t stop it and I can\u0027t slow it down. I can\u0027t figure out what it wants\" His weary voice broke at the end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt the same way I had yesterday, when I\u0027d seen the black stains across her stomach - furious, and a little crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clenched my hands into fists to control the shaking. I hated the thing that was hurting her. It wasn\u0027t enough for the monster to beat her from the inside out. No, it was starving her, too. Probably just looking for something to sink its teeth into - a throat to suck dry. Since it wasn\u0027t big enough to kill anyone else yet, it settled for sucking Bella\u0027s life from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could tell them exactly what it wanted: death and blood, blood and death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy skin was all hot and prickly. I breathed slowly in and out, focusing on that to calm myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I could get a better idea of what exactly it is,\" Carlisle murmured. \"The fetus is well protected. I haven\u0027t been able to produce an ultrasonic image. I doubt there is any way to get a needle through the amniotic sac, but Rosalie won\u0027t agree to let me try, in any case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A needle?\" I mumbled. \"What good would that do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The more I know about the fetus, the better I can estimate what it will be capable of. What I wouldn\u0027t give for even a little amniotic fluid. If I knew even the chromosomal count...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re losing me, Doc. Can you dumb it down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled once - even his laugh sounded exhausted. \"Okay. How much biology have you taken? Did you study chromosomal pairs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think so. We have twenty-three, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Humans do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked. \"How many do you have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-five.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned at my fists for a second. \"What does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought it meant that our species were almost completely different. Less related than a lion and a house cat. But this new life - well, it suggests that we\u0027re more genetically compatible than I\u0027d thought.\" He sighed sadly. \"I didn\u0027t know to warn them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, too. It had been easy to hate Edward for the same ignorance. I still hated him for it. It was just hard to feel the same way about Carlisle. Maybe because I wasn\u0027t ten shades of jealous in Carlisle\u0027s case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It might help to know what the count was - whether the fetus was closer to us or to her. To know what to expect.\" Then he shrugged. \"And maybe it wouldn\u0027t help anything. I guess I just wish I had something to study, anything to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonder what my chromosomes are like,\" I muttered randomly. I thought of those Olympic steroids tests again. Did they run DNA scans?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle coughed self-consciously. \"You have twenty-four pairs, Jacob.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned slowly to stare at him, raising my eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked embarrassed. \"I was... curious. I took the liberty when I was treating you last June.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about it for a second. \"I guess that should piss me off. But I don\u0027t really care.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. I should have asked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"S\u0027okay, Doc. You didn\u0027t mean any harm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I promise you that I did not mean you any harm. It\u0027s just that... I find your species fascinating. I suppose that the elements of vampiric nature have come to seem commonplace to me over the centuries. Your family\u0027s divergence from humanity is much more interesting. Magical, almost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo,\" I mumbled. He was just like Bella with all the magic garbage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle laughed another weary laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen we heard Edward\u0027s voice inside the house, and we both paused to listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be right back, Bella. I want to speak with Carlisle for a moment. Actually, Rosalie, would you mind accompanying me?\" Edward sounded different. There was a little life in his dead voice. A spark of something. Not hope exactly, but maybe the desire to hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it, Edward?\" Bella asked hoarsely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing you need to worry about, love. It will just take a second. Please, Rose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Esme?\" Rosalie called. \"Can you mindBella for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIheard the whisper of wind as Esme flitted down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle shifted, twisting to look expectantly at the door. Edward was through the door first, with Rosalie right on his heels. His face was, like his voice, no longer dead. He seemed intensely focused. Rosalie looked suspicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward shut the door behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carlisle,\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it, Edward?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps we\u0027ve been going about this the wrong way. I was listening to you and Jacob just now, and when you were speaking of what the... fetus wants, Jacob had an interesting thought.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe?What had thought? Besides my obvious hatred for the thing? At least I wasn\u0027t alone in that. I could tell that Edward had a difficult time using a term as mild as fetus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We haven\u0027t actually addressed that angle,\" Edward went on. \"We\u0027ve been trying to get Bella what she needs. And her body is accepting it about as well as one of ours would. Perhaps we should address the needs of the... fetus first. Maybe if we can satisfy it, we\u0027ll be able to help her more effectively.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not following you, Edward,\" Carlisle said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think about it, Carlisle. If that creature is more vampire than human, can\u0027t you guess what it craves\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;- what it\u0027s not getting? Jacob did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did? I ran through the conversation, trying to remember what thoughts I\u0027d kept to myself. I remembered at the same time that Carlisle understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" he said in a surprised tone. \"You think it is... thirsty?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosalie hissed under her breath. She wasn\u0027t suspicious anymore. Her revoltingly perfect face wasall lit up, her eyes wide with excitement. \"Of course,\" she muttered. \"Carlisle, we have all that type O negative laid aside for Bella. It\u0027s a good idea,\" she added, not looking at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm.\" Carlisle put his hand to his chin, lost in thought. \"I wonder... And then, what would be the best way to administer___\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosalie shook her head. \"We don\u0027t have time to be creative. I\u0027d say we should start with the traditional way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute,\" i whispered. \"Just hold on. Are you - are you talking about making Bella drink blood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was your idea, dog,\" Rosalie said, scowling at me without ever quite looking at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored her and watched Carlisle. That same ghost of hope that had been in Edward\u0027s face was now in the doctor\u0027s eyes. He pursed his lips, speculating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s just...\" I couldn\u0027t find the right word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Monstrous?\" Edward suggested. \"Repulsive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what if it helps her?\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head angrily. \"What are you gonna do, shove a tube down her throat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I plan to ask her what she thinks. I just wanted to run it past Carlisle first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosalie nodded. \"If you tell her it might help the baby, she\u0027ll be willing to do anything. Even if we do have to feed them through a tube.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized then - when I heard how her voice got all loveydovey as she said the word baby - that Blondie would be in line with anything that helped the little life-sucking monster. Was that what was going on, the mystery factor that was bonding the two of them? Was Rosalie after the kid?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the corner of my eye, I saw Edward nod once, absently, not looking in my direction. But I knew he was answering my questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuh. I wouldn\u0027t have thought the ice-cold Barbie would have a maternal side. So much for protecting Bella - Rosalie\u0027d probably jam the tube down Bella\u0027s throat herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward\u0027s mouth mashed into a hard line, and I knew I was right again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, we don\u0027t have time to sit around discussing this,\" Rosalie said impatiently. \"What do you think, Carlisle? Can we try?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle took a deep breath, and then he was on his feet. \"We\u0027ll ask Bella.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlondie smiled smugly - sure that, if it was up to Bella, she would get her way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dragged myself up from the stairs and followed after them as they disappeared into the house. I wasn\u0027t sure why. Just morbid curiosity, maybe. It was like a horror movie. Monsters and blood all over the place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I just couldn\u0027t resist another hit of my dwindling drug supply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella lay flat on the hospital bed, her belly a mountain under the sheet. She looked like wax - colorless and sort of see-through. You\u0027d think she was already dead, except for the tiny movement of her chest, her shallow breathing. And then her eyes, following the four of us with exhausted suspicion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others were at her side already, flitting across the room with sudden darting motions. It was creepy to watch. 1 ambled along at a slow walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on?\" Bella demanded in a scratchy whisper. Her waxy hand twitched up - like she was trying to protect her balloon-shaped stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jacob had an idea that might help you,\" Carlisle said. I wished he would leave me out of it. I hadn\u0027t suggested anything. Give the credit to her bloodsucking husband, where it belonged. \"It won\u0027t be... pleasant, but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it will help the baby,\" Rosalie interrupted eagerly. \"We\u0027ve thought of a better way to feed him. Maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella\u0027s eyelids fluttered. Then she coughed out a weak chuckle. \"Not pleasant?\" she whispered. \"Gosh, that\u0027ll be such a change.\" She eyed the tube stuck into her arm and coughed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlondie laughed with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl looked like she only had hours left, and she had to be in pain, but she was making jokes. So Bella.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrying to ease the tension, make it better for everyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward stepped around Rosalie, no humor touching his intense expression. I was glad for that. It helped, just a little bit, that he was suffering worse than me. He took her hand, not the one that was still protecting her swollen belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella, love, we\u0027re going to ask you to do something monstrous,\" he said, using the same adjectives he\u0027d offered me. \"Repulsive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, at least he was giving it to her straight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a shallow, fluttery breath. \"How bad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle answered. \"We think the fetus might have an appetite closer to ours than to yours. We think it\u0027s thirsty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked. \"Oh. Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your condition - both of your conditions - are deteriorating rapidly. We don\u0027t have time to waste, to come up with more palatable ways to do this. The fastest way to test the theory - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got to drink it,\" she whispered. She nodded slightly - barely enough energy for a little head bob. \"I can do that. Practice for the future, right?\" Her colorless lips stretched into a faint grin as she looked at Edward. He didn\u0027t smile back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosalie started tapping her toe impatiently. The sound was really irritating. I wondered what she would do if I threw her through a wall right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, who\u0027s going to catch me a grizzly bear?\" Bella whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle and Edward exchanged a quick glance. Rosalie stopped tapping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Bella asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will be a more effective test if we don\u0027t cut corners, Bella,\" Carlisle said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ifthe fetus is craving blood,\" Edward explained, \"it\u0027s not craving animal blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It won\u0027t make a difference to you, Bella. Don\u0027t think about it,\" Rosalie encouraged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella\u0027s eyes widened. \"Who?\" she breathed, and her gaze flickered to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not here as a donor, Bells,\" I grumbled. \"\u0027Sides, it\u0027s human blood that thing\u0027s after, and I don\u0027t think mine applies - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have blood on hand,\" Rosalie told her, talking over me before I\u0027d finished, like I wasn\u0027t there. \"For you - just in case. Don\u0027t worry about anything at all. It\u0027s going to be fine. I have a good feeling about this, Bella. I think the baby will be so much better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBella:s hand ran across her stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" she rasped, barely audible. \"I\u0027m starving, so I\u0027ll bet he is, too.\" Trying to make another joke. \"Let\u0027s go for it. My first vampire act.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-4-breaking-dawn-twilight-4/page-13.html","bookId":2026,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:16:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:16:26 PM"}
