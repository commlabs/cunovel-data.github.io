The powerful beams of light from the four searchlights continued to concentrate on Ledesma’s body, clearly displaying his expression in his final moment. Frozen on that face was unwillingness, fear, anger, as well as many, many other things.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIf history could be preserved, then in this region, Ledesma’s name would be remembered by the people, passed down by a few historians. Towards this ambitious and ruthless character who relied on his dozen or so companions to form Sinking Blade from nothing, and then established Midnight City that was both hell and heaven, moreover just a step away from becoming the king of the great lakes western region, regardless of which history textbook it was, as long as it touched upon this region, there was no way his name would be skipped.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs an engineer, Ledesma’s greatest contribution to this era was his reconstruction of Midnight City’s water purifying factory, and this was what allowed them to establish the first, as well as the only indoor farm. With these two installations, several hundred thousand individuals could survive. Under Sinking Blade’s rule, the citizens still had to struggle for survival, but at the very least, they could survive as long as they paid their dues in effort.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, Ledesma’s luck still wasn’t good enough.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIf it was in the olden era, he might have a chance at becoming a great figure that didn’t lose out to the federation’s most famous presidents.

His messy hair and untrimmed beard covered half his face, but a pair of eyes with latin lineage displayed a brilliance that didn’t match his appearance. He also had two levels of power, so among civilians, or even the army, he could be considered an expert, but was still far too inferior when compared to Ledesma’s elite bodyguards, let alone right now when he carried no weapons.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eA military soldier handed this old-fashioned camera over to Su, clearly trying to curry favor.

You are just going to let it be like this? Don’t you want to leave behind a few more photographs? Hey, listen to me, let me take some pictures of you! You will be remembered by people from several hundred years later!”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen Su’s figure completely disappeared through the main entrance into Ledesma’s residence, the officer gave the male a fierce kick, gnashing his teeth while saying, “Photograph?
