Just charming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Christina? Yes, she\u0027s…\" The devil with blonde hair? No, that wouldn\u0027t do. \"… great. Just great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, darling, if you\u0027re finished with me, I have to see about a few things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hilarious, the way the queen pretended like she couldn\u0027t hang up anytime she wanted. Alex bit back a giggle that was half hysterical with relief. \"Thank you again for your time. Please give my congratulations to William.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will, dear. Good day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as she hung up her door opened and Sheldon stuck his head inside. \"Tell me you weren\u0027t just gossiping with the Queen of England.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hardly. Grab Jenny, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her a mock salute, vanished out of the doorway, then Jenny came into the room, Sheldon on her heels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny barely sketched the traditional bow before bursting out, \"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cake. She\u0027ll send an invitation as long as none of us show up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny closed her eyes in brief relief. \"Edmund and I will see that you\u0027re all far too busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute,\" Sheldon said. Alex saw he had no backpack. Why did that surprise, annoy, and thrill her, all at once? \"That was the plan? To get an invitation but not do anything about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A brilliant plan,\" Jenny said, smiling at her boss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your dad wanted to be invited but didn\u0027t want to go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He hates those things. You\u0027ve met him—he almost fell asleep during the last royal wedding, and that was his own son\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he\u0027s not going to do anything with the invite? He\u0027s got that much pride?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey just looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, right. Dumb question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 41\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you bring any toys?\" she murmured, returning his wild kisses as they tumbled to the bed, rolling and tugging and stroking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a single thing.\" He had her breasts bared and was kissing her nipples, and she wriggled out of her skirt and tugged on his pants. After much flailing of limbs, they were finally naked… or naked enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Afraid of a strip-search?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he mumbled into her mouth. \"Just another step in the plan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um… what plan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell you later,\" he said, gripping her wrists in his hands and pinning them over her head. His knee went between her thighs, forcing them wide for him, and he thrust into her. She gasped and surged to meet him, wrapping her legs around his waist and rocking against him. \"Oh Christ… that\u0027s good… don\u0027t stop doing that…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t if you won\u0027t… oh, God…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe captured her mouth again and again, kissing her so passionately, as if he hadn\u0027t seen her in a year rather than a day, and she returned his passion, his thrusts, and then trembled around him as her orgasm burst through her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,God , that\u0027s nice,\" he said into her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re… telling… me…\" she panted. She wriggled a bit, but he had her wrists pinned firmly, and the thought—she couldn\u0027t get away, not if he didn\u0027t want her to, but nothing bad would happen, he\u0027d never let anything bad happen—made her rock into another orgasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stiffened above her and his breathing stopped for a moment. Then he collapsed against her shoulder with a groan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment, she whispered, \"Are you going to let me go now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never,\" he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 42\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicky!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet down!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex.\" His hands, stroking her in the dark. \"It\u0027s just a dream. Go back to sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" she said fuzzily, and did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"… I just think if you tried a nice Serena, or maybe a Majorero, you might be pleasantly surprised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had his hands clamped over his ears and was rolling back and forth on the bed, chanting, \"La la la la la la la la!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you can hear me!\" Alex shouted, leaning over him. \"I\u0027m not saying start with a blue, something really strong. Pick a mild one. It\u0027s no worse than Velveeta, and actually quite a bit better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShel cracked one eye open, but didn\u0027t remove his hands. \"Are you done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, idiot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I\u0027ve put up with a lot, Princess, but there are some things I will not do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Igave up insomnia for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Totally different thing. And actually, I cured your insomnia. And your, uh, sex problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was amused. \"You cured me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All part of my plan. If the handcuffs worked, we\u0027d try that, then move to ties, then me, then nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing? You mean masturbation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he replied, not acknowledging her joke. \"Like a real couple who love each other and don\u0027t need tricks to prove it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was speechless, and swallowed the lump that had suddenly appeared in her throat. \"A—a couple in love? But we—I mean, I\u0027m not going to be here forever…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing; just looked at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And—and I didn\u0027t think—I mean, I thought we were—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You let just any guy tie you up, then?\" he asked coolly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! You know I don\u0027t. You know you\u0027re the only man I ever—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a discreet rap at the door. \"Come in,\" Alex almost snarled, as Shel snatched a blanket to cover his nudity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny diffidently stepped into the bedroom. \"I beg your pardon, Highness. Dr. Rivers. But Prince David is on the phone, and his schedule is very tight today. Will you take the call?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Put him through.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Again, my apologies for disturbing you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re kind of in the middle of something,\" Shel warned her. She ignored him, and picked up the phone when it rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\" She could see that Shel, disgusted, had gotten up and was hunting for his clothes. Oh, great. So much for their romantic day together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex? Hi! How\u0027s it going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything\u0027s fine, David,\" she replied, ignoring Shel\u0027s glare. \"How\u0027s Dara? How\u0027s Chris?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re fine. Chris keeps showing her your TV appearances and that spread in US\u0027 magazine about you. I think she recognizes you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s great. What\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I just wanted to know why nobody\u0027s scheduled my trip. Edmund\u0027s not here, and my guy doesn\u0027t know a thing about it, and Jenny—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Geneva thing got cancelled,\" her brother explained patiently. \"Remember? I know Dad told you. So I can come out there and finish up. I mean, hell, the only reason you got stuck with it is because I was tied up with something else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tied up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you hear me okay? Is it a bad connection?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fine. Geneva was cancelled? He… Dad did mention something about it…\" And she assumed he was kidding. He was not. In fact, it appeared he had dropped the entire issue. But why? To see what she would do? Or not do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. So, when do you want to come back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can come back anytime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? I\u0027ve got your schedule right here; looks like you\u0027ve got a free day, you lucky jerk. You want to come back this afternoon? You could be eating at your own table for suppertime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ll be sorry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, then. Have Jenn coordinate with the NDISL people and tell them I\u0027ll be out first thing in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re ruining everything. Everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do that, gladly. It\u0027ll be good to be back home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bet. Fish out of water there, huh? Not exactly your field. It was great of you to go and take one for the team.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was glad to, but it\u0027ll… it\u0027ll be good to be back. It\u0027s… it\u0027s been kind of a disaster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou idiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 43\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Youcoward .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStung, and embarrassed, she cried, \"You know I\u0027m not! You know what I did!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sure,\" he sneered, \"swing a chair and fracture the skull of a bad guy to save your family, great. Even a rabbit will fight if you pin them to the wall. But when it comes to actual hard emotional truth and bravery, you\u0027re on the first fucking plane out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My job is done! I have to go back. The crown prince and the king said so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, fuck the crown prince and the king! Like you couldn\u0027t stay if you really wanted to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shel, I wasn\u0027t even supposed to be the one to come out here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m sure as shit not going to fuck your brother whenhe shows up!\" Shel roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good, because he\u0027s taken!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you get it, you goddamned idiot?So are you .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Watch your mouth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So sorry, Princess Idiot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know,\" she said through gritted teeth, \"every once in a while, it would be alittle nice if you were just a tiny bit respectful of my title.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, and a cure for cancer would be nice, too, but it\u0027s not in the cards for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shel, it\u0027s not just me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve never even said—not in so many words… You\u0027ve been having a good time, too, just like me. Right?\" she added tentatively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? You want the words? No problem. I love you. I love you like no one in my life, and I\u0027ll never love anyone like I love you again, ever.I love you . There.\" He crossed his arms over his chest and added with pure contempt, \"Now let\u0027s watch you break a speed record getting to the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ground her teeth. Had she ever been so thrilled, terrified, furious, and happy at the same time? She was so dizzy she was afraid she\u0027d vomit. And she\u0027d rather split a tooth than cry in front of him. \"You don\u0027t even know me.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-pain-alaskan-royal-family-2/page-24.html","bookId":2790,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:35:41 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:35:41 PM"}
