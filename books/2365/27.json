Rhino and the Shadow were there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Kat walked in, Dinetto turned to them and said, \"Get lost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat watched them leave the room. Dinetto looked at Kat and said, \"I owe you one.\" \"You don\u0027t owe me anything.\" \"Is that what you think my life is worth? I hear you\u0027re setting married.\" \"That\u0027s right. To a doctor.\" \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, tell him to take good care of you, or he\u0027ll have to answer to me.\" \"I\u0027ll tell him.\" There was a small pause. \"I\u0027m sorry about Mike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll be all right,\" Kat said. \"I had a long talk with him. He\u0027ll be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" Dinetto held out a bulky manila envelope. \"A little wedding present for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat shook her head. \"No. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take care of yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You, too. You know something? You\u0027re a real stand-up broad. I\u0027m going to tell you something I want you to remember. If you ever need a favor - anything -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;you come to me. You hear me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hear you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew that he meant it. And she knew that she would never go to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the weeks that followed, Paige and Jason spoke on the phone three and four times a day, and were together every time Paige was not on night call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hospital was busier than ever. Paige had been on a thirty-six-hour shift that had been filled with emei-gencies. She had just gone to sleep in the on-call room when she was awakened by the urgent shrill of the telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fumbled the phone to her ear. \"H\u0027lo?\" \"Dr. Taylor, will you come to Room 422, stat?\" Paige tried to clear her mind. Room 422. One of Dr Barker\u0027s patients. Lance Kelly. He had just had a mitral valve replaced. Something must have gone wrong. Paigfc stumbled off the cot and walked out into the deserted corridor. She decided not to wait for the elevator. She ran up the stairs. Maybe it\u0027s just a nervous nurse. If it\u0027s serious, I\u0027ll call Dr. Barker, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked into Room 422 and stood in the doorway, staring. The patient was fighting for breath and moaning. The nurse turned to Paige in obvious relief. \"I didn\u0027t know what to do, doctor. I ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige hurried to the bedside. \"You\u0027re going to be fine,\" she said reassuringly. She took his wrist between two fingers. His pulse was jumping wildly. The mitral valve was malfunctioning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s sedate him,\" Paige ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nurse handed Paige a syringe, and Paige injected it into a vein. Paige turned to the nurse. \"Tell the head nurse to get an operating team together, stat. And send for Dr. Barker!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifteen minutes later, Kelly was on the operating table. The team consisted of two scrub nurses, a circulating nurse, and two residents. A television monitor was perched high in a corner of the room to display the heart rate, EKG, and blood pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe anesthesiologist walked in, and Paige felt like cursing. Most of the anesthesiologists at the hospital were skilled doctors, but Herman Koch was an exception. Paige had worked with him before and tried to avoid him as much as possible. She did not trust him. Now she had no choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige watched him secure a tube to the patient\u0027s throat, while she unfolded a paper drape with a clear window and placed it over the patient\u0027s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put a line into the jugular vein,\" Paige said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKoch nodded. \"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the residents asked, \"What\u0027s the problem here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Barker replaced the mitral valve yesterday. I think it\u0027s ruptured.\" Paige looked over at Dr. Koch. \"Is he out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKoch nodded. \"Sleeping like he\u0027s in bed at home.\" I wish you were, Paige thought. \"What are you using?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Propofol.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched Kelly being connected to the heart-lung machine so she could perform a cardiopulmonary bypass. Paige studied the monitors on the wall. Pulse 140 ... blood oxygen saturation 92 percent... blood pressure 80 over 60. \"Let\u0027s go,\" Paige said. One of the residents put on music. Paige stepped up to the operating table under eleven hundred watts of hot white light and turned to the scrub nurse. \"Scalpel, please ...\" The operation began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige removed all the sternal wires from the operation the day before. She then cut from the base of the neck to the lower end of the sternum, while one of the residents blotted away the blood with gauze pads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe carefully went through the layers of fat and muscle, and in front of her was the erratically beating heart. \"There\u0027s the problem,\" Paige said. \"The atrium is perforated. Blood is collecting around the heart and compressing it.\" Paige was looking at the monitor on the wall. The pump pressure had dropped dangerously. \"Increase the flow,\" Paige ordered. The door to the operating room opened and Lawrence Barker stepped in. He stood to one side, watching what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige said, \"Dr. Barker. Do you want to ...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s your operation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige took a quick look at what Koch was doing. \"Be careful. You\u0027ll overanesthetize him, dammit! Slow it down!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s in V-tach! His pressure is dropping!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want me to do?\" Koch asked helplessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should know, Paige thought angrily. \"Give him lidocaine and epinephrine! Now!\" She was yelling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige watched as Koch picked up a syringe and injected it into the patient\u0027s IV.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA resident looked at the monitor and called out, \"Blood pressure is falling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige was working frantically to stop the flow of blood. She looked up at Koch. \"Too much flow! I told you to ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe noise of the heartbeat on the monitor suddenly became chaotic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God! Something\u0027s gone wrong!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me the defibrillator!\" Paige yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe circulating nurse reached for the defibrillator on the crash cart, opened two sterile paddles, and plugged them in. She turned the buttons up to charge them and ten seconds later handed them to Paige.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took the paddles and positioned them directly over Kelly\u0027s heart. Kelly\u0027s body jumped, then fell back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige tried again, willing him to come back to life, willing him to breathe again. Nothing. The heart lay still, a dead, useless organ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaige was in a fury. Her part of the operation had been successful. Koch had overanesthetized the patient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Paige was applying the defibrillator to Lanct Kelly\u0027s body for the third futile time, Dr. Barker stepped up to the operating table and turned to Paige. \"You killed him.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nothing-lasts-forever/page-27.html","bookId":2365,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:11:31 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:11:31 AM"}
