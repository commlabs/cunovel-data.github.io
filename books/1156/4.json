But it would surely end by their forgiving her. They could not hold out against her very long.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are—sure—it—it—would be right, Mr. Ainsley?\" she faltered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You must not call me \u0027mister\u0027 sweet one,\" he cried. \"To you I shall be \u0027Royal\u0027 from now on to eternity. Let me manage this affair, my darling,\" he added.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All power of resistance seemed swallowed up by his indomitable will.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Go to the cloak-room, my love,\" he whispered, \"and change your attire as quickly as you can. I will meet you at the fountain nearest the entrance. Not one word to either of your friends, Ida,\" he said, warningly. \"Promise me that!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was no crossing him. Indeed, the very power to even think for herself seemed to have left her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Like one in a dream, Ida May donned her street clothes, the thought filling her mind of what Hildegarde[19] and Lily would say when it was unmasking time and they came to look for her. How startled they would be!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Outside all was confusion. There was a great crush of carriages, the babble of coachmen and footmen, the crunching of wheels, and the calling of numbers. To the girl whom Royal Ainsley led on to so strange a fate it seemed like a dream. Some one followed with their wheels. Royal Ainsley took them from the man, and she saw him toss him several pieces of silver.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He did not tell her that he had written a note to an old minister, living two miles out of the village, asking him to remain at home to marry them. No name had been signed to the note; but he had argued to himself that the minister, who probably was sadly in need of making an extra dollar, would stay at home to perform the ceremony. If his plans matured well, all well and good; if they miscarried, well, no one would be the wiser as to who sent the letter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He assisted her to mount her wheel, and, as if in a dream, they went speeding down the boulevard.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We must make quicker time, my darling,\" he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Was it a sob he heard coming from the girl\u0027s lips? Ida May seemed to have suddenly awakened to a sense of what she had done. A brief half hour since she had been in the midst of a brilliant party, and now, scarcely knowing how it had come about, she found herself flying with the handsome lover, whom she had known but a few short weeks, going she knew not whither.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The awakening came to her like a terrible shock.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Royal!\" she cried, \"oh, Royal, what have we done? Where are we going? I did not mean to run away. I must have been mad. Let us go back again!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [20]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As she spoke, the great clock from some adjoining tower struck the hour of twelve.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We are too late,\" he said. \"We have burned our bridges behind us. They are unmasking now, and they have missed you. They will soon institute a search.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She clasped his arm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, Royal! I must tell you all!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The hot, trembling hand clung to him, the lovely young face was full of awful grief.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My own darling!\" he cried, leaning over and rapturously embracing her, though in doing so he nearly caused her to fall from her wheel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Suddenly the heavens overhead seemed to darken, the wind to freshen, and the booming of the waves, as they dashed heavily against the shore, sounded dismally in the distance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We must make haste,\" said Royal Ainsley; \"there is a storm coming up. I think we could save nearly half a mile by cutting across this field.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He swung open a gate opening out into a broad patch of land, and Ida rode in.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1691/49776.html","bookId":1156,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 6:40:07 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 6:40:07 AM"}
