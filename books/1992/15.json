Nothing about that conversation had made sense. He\u0027d asked me how life was. I\u0027d told him it was good. He had said I should strive for great. I told him it was perfect and he had gone silent. Then he\u0027d said, Sometimes what we think is perfect is royally fucked up. I had asked him what he meant and he said he was just checking in and hoped I\u0027d figure life out soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell had all that meant? Was he drinking before lunch? Glancing at my clock, I realized it was my tee time with Jace. When Della had turned me down for lunch I\u0027d let her because she wanted to work. I couldn\u0027t keep making her feel like she wasn\u0027t important. So to keep myself from begging her to have lunch with me, I\u0027d called Jace and set up a tee time for us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a meeting with my new lawyer at three, then after that I would hunt her down. I thought she\u0027d be ready to take a break then. Smiling, I let Tripp\u0027s weird phone call go and I headed down to the golf course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJace was standing at Bethy\u0027s golf cart with his hands on the roof as he leaned in, flirting with her. I never would have guessed those two would have made it so long. Bethy had been the wild local girl who lived in the next town over. She slept with the rich boys and they acted like they didn\u0027t know her in public. Until Jace. He\u0027d decided that she was worth it. He had seen something more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gonna stop making out with my employee long enough to play a round?\" I asked as I approached them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJace grinned over at me, then flipped his middle finger. \"Suck it, Kerrington.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You two need me to get y\u0027all a caddy?\" Bethy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re real men, baby. We don\u0027t need a caddy,\" Jace said, winking at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s do this. I have a three o\u0027clock appointment,\" I informed Jace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cart I\u0027d ordered was brought around with my clubs. Jace said his good-byes to Bethy and put his clubs in the back of the cart. \"It\u0027s been a while since we played a round,\" Jace said. \"Boss man never has any time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Della has taken a lot off me. I need to give her a raise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJace chuckled and propped his feet up on the dash of the cart. \"You told your momma about the new-board idea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t be telling her. It isn\u0027t her business. I\u0027m meeting with the lawyer today to make sure this is handled the correct way. The lawyer will make sure the board knows they\u0027ve been terminated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, I always thought the board, like, owned a portion of the club,\" Jace said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My grandfather forbade it in his will. He wanted the club to always be under the Kerrington name. He didn\u0027t allow investors unless they were family. That was one of the reasons my father wanted me to marry Angelina. She would become family and he would merge her father\u0027s clubs with the Kerrington Club. My grandfather wouldn\u0027t have wanted that. I\u0027ve looked over his business plan. I know his dream for this place. My father had other ideas and he was going to use me to accomplish them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJace let out a low whistle as we pulled up to the first tee. \"Damn, no wonder your dad was ready to marry you off to a psycho. So, you really own it all now. You make the decisions. That board was just so your father had people to help him build and make decisions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think he had promised them a piece of the pie once the Kerrington Club was part of the Greystone empire. Everything would have changed then. He also paid them well. I looked over the payroll.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJace jumped out and pulled his driver from the bag before heading over to the tee. \"So you\u0027re saying I\u0027m gonna get a nice fat paycheck for being on this new board,\" Jace drawled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, that\u0027s what I\u0027m saying,\" I replied, pulling the driver from my bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Because I\u0027m gonna propose to Bethy and my family is gonna shit a brick. I can kiss my monthly income good-bye. I need to start using this education my father paid so handsomely for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped walking. Had I just heard him right? \"Did you just say propose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJace looked up from his stance over the ball and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow,\" was all I could think of to say. I hadn\u0027t expected that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love her. She\u0027s it for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood there silently as Jace hit the ball. He stepped back and glanced over at me. \"She doesn\u0027t know yet. I\u0027m trying to think of a romantic way to do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis golf game had just gotten a lot more interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI texted Della before my three o\u0027clock meeting but she didn\u0027t respond before the lawyer arrived. Once my meeting was over and there was still no response, I dialed her number. I hadn\u0027t seen her all day. Neither had anyone I asked. Something felt wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, but the number you have dialed has been disconnected . . .\" I jerked my phone back and looked down to make sure I\u0027d dialed Della\u0027s number. I had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed my keys and walked past Vince without a word. My mind was running wild. Why would Della\u0027s phone be disconnected? Had she forgotten to pay the bill? Was she okay?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I got to the house, every bad scenario ran through my head. The car I\u0027d given Della when she\u0027d come back to Rosemary with me was sitting in the drive. She hadn\u0027t left the house today. My heart raced as I ran up the steps and swung the door open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was quiet. Too quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Della? Baby? You okay?\" I called out as I walked down the hall toward the living room. I glanced into the kitchen as I passed and almost continued on when I saw a single piece of paper and a pen lying on the counter. They hadn\u0027t been there that morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Della?\" I called out again, walking on toward the living room and out onto the balcony. The bedroom was empty. It was also bare. There were no heels lying by the door or jewelry on the dresser. I stood in the doorway, afraid to walk inside and look in the closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned and headed back to the kitchen. The note would explain this. She could have cleaned up before she went shopping with Blaire. That made sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching for the paper, I picked it up and began to read. With each word, my world began to slowly fall away. The small, ripped piece of notebook paper held the only words that could completely destroy me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let it fall to the floor as I stood frozen. I didn\u0027t want to touch it. I didn\u0027t want to see it. The words were imprinted in my head. I\u0027d never be able to make them go away. I couldn\u0027t move. I couldn\u0027t breathe. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/simple-perfection-perfection-2/page-15.html","bookId":1992,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:59 AM"}
