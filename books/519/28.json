{"id":10437,"no":28,"title":"CHAPTER XXVIII. BAFFLED.","content":"Balmayne danced down the lane with impotent fury. Despite her peril and the fear that was in her heart, Hetty smiled. Here was a daring and audacious rascal engaged in some desperate and, no doubt, cunning scheme who was utterly baffled by a mere girl and a hairpin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hetty checked the smile, for that might have grown hysterical. She had to brace herself to the effort, an easier task seeing that Gordon Bruce was uppermost in her mind. For him she would have dared and done anything. The woman who was at the bottom of this thing was his deadly enemy. To gain her secrets must help in Gordon\u0027s final victory.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Balmayne knelt down there with one of the lamps in his hand. His face was not good to look upon. Leona Lalage watched him eagerly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is it a very bad puncture?\" she asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It isn\u0027t a puncture at all,\" Balmayne snarled, \"at least not an accidental one. Some mischievous fiend must have passed down the lane just now and done this for pure wickedness. There are two long slashes in the tyres.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And the mending will be a matter of time?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Rather. An expert couldn\u0027t do it under an hour. Both those tyres will have to come off. Now what are we to do?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Countess clasped her hands together in hopeless rage.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If I only had that ruffian here!\" she said. Her voice was low, she strode backwards and forwards like an angry wolf. \"Oh, if I only had him here! I should like you to hold him down so that I----\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"drop it,\" Balmayne said rudely. \"What\u0027s the good of that theatrical nonsense? If something is not done at once our plans are utterly ruined. Don\u0027t stand there like a tragedy actress, but suggest something.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But what can I suggest? This thing has taken me utterly by surprise. The only thing is to carry that thing back into the street and lay him down where you found him. A policeman saw him leave the house. It will be thought that he had a fit in the street, and we shall not be suspected.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And meanwhile the policeman on the beat has been at least twice past the spot where the body ought to be,\" Balmayne sneered. \"People in fits don\u0027t get out of the way and then come back again.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"True,\" the Countess exclaimed. \"I had not thought of that. Wheel your motor into the courtyard of the Corner House before a policeman comes this way, and carry him back into the house.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was nothing else to do, and Balmayne complied, muttering. The autocar was disposed of, and Balmayne, breathless and dripping under the weight of his burden, staggered back into Lytton Avenue Gardens again. Once the little green gate was closed he could breathe more freely. But the perils and dangers of the night were not over yet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The unconscious form of Maitrank was cast carelessly on the grass. Balmayne wiped his heated forehead. The moon came out from behind a ragged bank of cloud and fell on the face of the sleeping capitalist It was so white and still that he might have been dead already.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The white, still face looked up, the murderous dark one looked down. Balmayne kicked the body in a sudden spurt of passion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You miserly old dog,\" he growled. \"A nice dance you are leading us. I wish I knew what on earth to do with you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Countess gripped his arm convulsively.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Kill him,\" she said in a hoarse whisper that thrilled Hetty. \"That is a sure and easy way out of the peril. We can prove that he left the house, nobody can prove that he ever returned. I have my jewels back; there is nothing that we can be traced by. And the secret dies with him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Balmayne gave a shudder. Even he recoiled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have never had that on my conscience,\" he whispered. \"And if we do----\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Kill him,\" urged the Countess. \"Kneel down and pin that wrap over his face. He is an old man, and the drug has affected his heart. He will go off quietly in his sleep. Then you can throw him down the well in the courtyard of the Corner House.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can I help you?\" cried Hetty, with a voice so steady that it astonished herself. \"I had a dreadful headache, so I thought I would steal down into the garden. Have you killed a burglar or something of that kind?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Leona Lalage was the first to recover herself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Something of that kind,\" she said. \"My friend Mr. Balmayne was bringing my motor back when he found this poor fellow unconscious in the lane. Mr. Balmayne called out to me for assistance and I fortunately heard.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hetty nodded. Truly the woman was magnificent.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Had you not best get him into the house?\" Hetty suggested. \"It is not cold, but any one who is ill, to lie on the damp grass----\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Countess touched Balmayne. She had turned her face away, fearful lest the expression of it should be seen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Convey him into the house,\" the Countess ordered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was nothing for it now but to obey. Hetty followed slowly and crept up to her own bedroom. Once there, she dropped into a chair, and just for the moment the whole world seemed to be whirling before her sightless eyes.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2113/59939.html","bookId":519,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:06:20 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:06:20 AM"}
