I couldn\u0027t concentrate in class, knowing I was privy to a secret world of vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClassmates continued to bury their heads in textbooks and anticipate the next soccer game, while I doodled in my journal and couldn\u0027t wait for the next sunset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was still an outcast, but I think my classmates got a rise that Trevor had been dethroned from his kingdom. And although they didn\u0027t high-five me in the hallway or invite me to their parties, I was actually given a cutter\u0027s privilege at the drinking fountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a shame Alexander is homeschooled. It would be nice to eat lunch as a foursome,\" Becky said at lunch on the baseball bleachers. \"Yeah, that would rock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But still, we should do something together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about going to the drive-in?\" Matt asked, as he walked up the bleachers behind me. \"Kissing Coffins is playing tonight. Admission is half price if you wear a costume.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cool! I\u0027ve always wanted to see it on the big screen. I\u0027m sure Alexander would love to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027ll be able to see what happens to Jenny,\" Becky said excitedly. \"I can dress as one of the town\u0027s vampires and wear a cape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And fangs!\" I added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then Trevor walked onto the field with his soccer-snob groupies. He looked up at Matt, who sat down next to Becky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs much as Trevor tormented me and as pathetic as I thought he was, I felt a tinge of pity for him. He was an even sadder case now that he was Matt-less. I watched Matt offer Becky his sandwich.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad you got traded to our team,\" I said to Matt, who closed his brown bag and gave me a warm smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter school, Becky and I searched through my closet to find her a costume to wear to the drive-in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Man, you do have a lot of black,\" she said, as I tossed out dozens of skirts and shirts for her to choose from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky modeled black tights, a black miniskirt, and a lacy black chemise. \"That\u0027s perfect. You\u0027ll be one of the members of the vampire gang who tries to convert Jenny. I just need my outfit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard my mom\u0027s SUV pull into the driveway, and Becky and I raced to meet her at the back door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I have an advance on my allowance?\" I asked hurriedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Calm down,\" she advised. \"Don\u0027t I even get a hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello,\" I replied. \"Now, can I have an advance on my allowance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope you didn\u0027t bid on a Hello Batty toaster on eBay again. I thought we told you--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to dye my hair blond.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blond?\" she asked, shocked. \"You are not going to ruin your gorgeous black hair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it needs to be blond to complete my costume.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you in a play?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, sort of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For school?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I just need your help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I have some wigs from college in the box I emptied for Nightmare. I know there\u0027s an auburn one. There may be a blond one, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we go see?\" I begged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom reluctantly put her purse down on the kitchen table, and Becky and I followed her into my parents\u0027 bedroom. She rummaged through an old Harrod\u0027s shopping bag. \"Here it is!\" she exclaimed, as if she\u0027d found a sunken treasure. She handed me a weathered blond wig. \"I wore this in college. Your father loved it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes. \"I also need a white dress,\" I confessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at me, pleased, as if her rebellious daughter were finally asking to borrow pearls. \"I\u0027ll see what I have!\" she replied gleefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up a pair of flared denims with rhinestones from the box. \"Do you believe I once wore these?\" she asked, holding them against her pleated Ann Taylor skirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a white blouse,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ahh. Here\u0027s a white eyelet skirt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom stuck the wig on my head, and I held the clothes in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s like looking at a teenage version of myself,\" she said fondly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI threw the skirt and blouse in the wash, and Becky and I returned to my room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are so going to rock!\" I said. \"But we just need one thing to complete our outfits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hunted through my dresser drawers, closet shelves, and boxes underneath my bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalloween was months ago, and in a town like Dullsville it was easier to find a fake Prada purse than fake teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrustrated, I banged on Billy Boy\u0027s door. He opened it slightly, sticking his Charlie Brown--shaped head out. I could barely see Henry typing at my brother\u0027s computer. \"Did you take my vampire teeth?\" I accused him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would I want your nasty saliva near me?\" Billy Boy said, starting to close the door on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I can\u0027t find them, and I have to have them for tonight,\" I argued, pressing the door back open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry rushed over to the door. \"I have some,\" he offered. \"Never been used.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry and Billy Boy rode their bikes, and I followed with Becky on mine. We must have been quite a sight as we headed to Henry\u0027s house at the edge of Oakley Woods--two goths and two nerds riding alongside one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe parked our bikes in Henry\u0027s driveway and entered the colonial-style five-bedroom house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were greeted by his housekeeper, who was folding laundry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked up the pristine wooden stairs to his bedroom. A NO YUPPIES ALLOWED sign hung on his door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like that,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA spongy black doormat rested on the floor, and a million dead bolts sealed his door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you hiding inside? Secret recipes of cafeteria food?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter he unlocked the outside dead bolts, he stepped onto the mat. His bedroom door sprung open automatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry had a loft bed, with a metallic blue computer underneath. Stars were pasted on his ceiling, I\u0027m sure in astronomically correct order. A solar system mobile hung from his ceiling fan. A telescope stood by his window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slid open his walk-in closet doors to reveal neatly stacked, clear plastic shoe boxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five dollars gets you samples,\" he said, pointing to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach box was labeled: ACNE, BLOOD, PIMPLES. PUKE. SCARS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who wants to have more pimples?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I have smells. Here,\" he said, opening a beaker and pushing it under my nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gross!\" I said, repulsed. \"It smells like the bathroom after Billy Boy uses it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up!\" my brother said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like to pour this on Mrs. Louis\u0027s chair sometimes,\" he said proudly. \"Look around. I have them alphabetized.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should have known.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecky and I each handed over our money and loaded our pockets with ghoulish goodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we were finished, Henry held a box before me as if he were holding the Holy Grail. He opened it, revealing two exact replicas of human teeth in the shape of fangs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With the glue, seven dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew I had only six in my purse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five dollars and a stick of gum,\" I offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Six. And your school picture,\" he countered. I looked hard at him, then at Becky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you inscribed it to me!\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" I begged, flashing her my puppydog eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her wallet and handed Henry the picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI handed him the money and left before he changed his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I headed out to meet Alexander for our date, I found my parents in the kitchen, paying bills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to be out a teensy bit late tonight,\" I advised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a school night,\" my mother said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, but we\u0027re going to the drive-in,\" I said with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you wait until the weekend?\" my mom asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because tonight\u0027s half price if you wear a costume. Becky and Matt are going, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Becky?\" my mother asked, surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, my little Becky. It\u0027ll be our first double date. Besides, I already did my homework, and we have a sub for first bell anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seems like you had all your excuses lined up,\" my father said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take care of the dishes all week,\" I said to my mother. \"And Dad, I\u0027ll wash your car.\" \"Last time you washed my car, you put Wicked Wiccas stickers on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you have to admit, it looked cool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And last time you took care of the dishes, you broke Grandma\u0027s teapot,\" my mother remembered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. Then we have a deal,\" I began. \"I\u0027ll just go to the movie, and I\u0027ll save you trouble by not doing your chores.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did that just happen?\" my dad wondered, as I headed for the front door. \"And when you\u0027re finished with that blond wig, your mother needs it back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slung my backpack filled with my Kissing Coffins accessories on my shoulder and grabbed a container of garlic powder from the kitchen. I held it tightly in my hand, as if I were holding a can of Mace, as I walked to the Mansion. If Jagger jumped out at me, I wanted to be protected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a familiar lurking presence as I turned the corner to Benson Hill. I saw a rustling in a bush and blond strands poking through the branches. I took a deep breath, and I quietly opened the container of garlic powder and threw it hard, directly into the brush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ouch!\" a male\u0027s voice cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrevor jumped out of the bush and held his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" I shouted at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw you coming up the road and wanted to scare you,\" he said, rubbing his wound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to hide. Your face alone could scare Frankenstein.\" I grabbed the container from the sidewalk and replaced it in my purse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked away, and Trevor continued to follow me as we drew closer to the gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really don\u0027t have time for you anymore,\" I said. \"I\u0027m going to the drive-in.\" And I slipped past the slightly open iron gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a pretty good arm. You should try out for the baseball team. And tell your gothic boyfriend,\" he called, \"if he wants to apply, they could use a batboy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left Trevor and was walking up the Mansion\u0027s driveway when I overheard him talking to someone outside the gate. I glanced back and saw my nemesis from behind, standing next to a guy with white hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped. Jagger and Trevor? A dangerous duo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sneaked back down the driveway and hid behind a bush next to the wrought-iron gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, watch out, dude!\" Trevor hollered. He must have bumped into Jagger in the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could only imagine Trevor\u0027s reaction to the shock of seeing the pale, tattooed, multipierced Jagger walking alone on a darkened street. I wasn\u0027t sure if Trevor would hit him or take off running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" Jagger said in a cool voice. \"I didn\u0027t see you coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s so dark around here,\" Jagger continued, shifting his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I think the Sterlings knock out the streetlamps on purpose.\" Jagger laughed. \"That babe you were walking with. She\u0027s your girlfriend?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Raven? She\u0027s my nightmare. No, she hangs out with the dude who lives in the Mansion. I\u0027ve never seen you around here before,\" he said, scrutinizing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just visiting. I\u0027m Sterling\u0027s friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Friend? I didn\u0027t think he had any,\" he said with a laugh. \"Well, you better catch him before they go to the drive-in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The drive-in?\" Jagger asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. It\u0027s built on an ancient burial ground,\" he whispered, as if revealing a secret. \"I\u0027ve heard that late at night, you can see ghosts eating popcorn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Burial ground?\" Jagger wondered aloud. \"Perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\" Trevor asked, confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh...a club initiation,\" Jagger rambled. \"But it\u0027s a very exclusive club...Maybe in the future you could join.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks anyway. Soccer takes all my free time. Besides, Sterling doesn\u0027t seem like the type to belong to a club.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s already a member. I just have to persuade Raven to join. Maybe I\u0027ll surprise them there,\" Jagger said. \"Can you point me in the right direction?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Follow me,\" Jagger\u0027s new ally said. \"It\u0027s on the way to the game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the two left together, my mouth hung open in disbelief. Jagger was planning to have a covenant ceremony tonight at the drive-in, with me as his covenant girl!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI needed a plan fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath and tried to think. If I canceled our double date, Jagger could return to my house, putting not only me but my family in danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t have much time to find a way to keep Jagger away for good without ending up as his dinner. Why couldn\u0027t Alexander and I just enjoy a movie together? Like Kissing Coffins, which reflected my own imminent situation--a movie about the vampire Vladimir Livingston, who tried to save the innocent mortal ingenue Jenny from the depths of the darkened Underworld.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it hit me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJagger was planning to take me tonight at the drive-in? But he couldn\u0027t. Not if I was already taken by someone else first. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/kissing-coffins-vampire-kisses-2/page-17.html","bookId":1867,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:44:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:44:26 PM"}
