I haven’t heard you sound so down in ages. When you start talking about cookie dough, I know there’s got to be a man involved. I figure this must have something to do with that commander you mentioned. I thought you said you wouldn’t be seeing him again. But apparently you have and it didn’t go well. Tell all!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazmine is fabulous, but the truth is, I had a miserable day myself. I worked from dawn to dusk, and financially it was my best business day ever, so I should be happy, right? I wasn’t. I wanted to be with Jazmine and Adam, who were off at a community fair while I was stuck at the ice-cream parlor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t even begin to tell you how much work is involved in owning a business like this. Catherine was the only employee willing to work this weekend and thankfully, her husband came in to lend a hand. I don’t know what I would’ve done otherwise. I really hated not being with Adam and Jazmine. They must’ve known it, because they showed up to collect me the minute I closed for the night. I didn’t have time to change my clothes or anything. Adam drove to a hilltop where we had a picnic, even though it was almost dark. Adam had bought deli sandwiches and salads. By the time we arrived home, it was after eleven. I’m afraid I was exhausted and not much fun. Sometimes I wonder if buying this business was the wisest choice, but it’s too late to think about that now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrite soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLove,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShana\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlison read her sister’s e-mail and tried to translate the message between the lines. Like Alison, Shana was tired. According to Jazmine, she worked long hours, starting early in the morning when she mixed the pizza dough and set it out to rise. She usually stayed until closing, which meant she often wasn’t home until after nine. Thankfully her sister had had the wherewithal to hire Catherine, who’d quickly become indispensable. Her other employees, mostly high-school kids, didn’t seem all that reliable, but at least she had them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam was spending a lot of time with Jazmine, and Alison knew very well that her daughter wasn’t the only draw. He and Shana were definitely getting along, and that thrilled her. But if Adam was transferred to Hawaii, that might be the end of their relationship. Still, Alison couldn’t worry about that when she had troubles of her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, she had Lieutenant Rowland to talk to. He was waiting for her when she reported for duty the next afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How’s the beast doing?” she asked in a stage whisper. Compared to the commander, their other patients were downright jovial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan’s responding grimace answered her question. “Same. Bad-tempered as ever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, great.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowland rolled his eyes. “He’s certainly got a burr under his saddle—and I think I know why.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlison did, too. “He hates being sick.” No one enjoyed it, but the commander was worse than most. He resented every minute away from his duty station. What he didn’t realize was that he wouldn’t be released anytime soon. She wasn’t going to be the one to tell him, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“His problem,” Rowland said with an air of superiority, “appears to be you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me?” she protested, flustered that Frank’s ranting from the day before had obviously continued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He asked me to keep you away from him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlison’s face burned with mortification. “What did you tell him?” she asked, her voice indignant despite her efforts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowland’s smile lacked humor. “That the United States Navy was fortunate to have you, and if he has a problem he should take it up with Captain Coleman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” she said, and swallowed a painful knot of gratitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The mighty commander didn’t have anything to say after that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.” Her anger simmering just below the surface, Alison squared her shoulders. “I think it’s time I faced the beast on my own.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRowland’s dark eyes flared. “I don’t know if I’d advise that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlison was past accepting her friend’s advice. If Frank Dillon had even a clue what she was thinking, she’d likely be up for court-martial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore common sense and what remained of her Navy career could stop her, she tore back the curtain to his cubicle and confronted the commander. Although he appeared to be sleeping, he must have heard her because his eyes fluttered open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand you requested not to be under my care.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked, and Alison was shocked to see that he refused to look at her. “You heard right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s fine with me, Commander. As far as I’m concerned, you’re cantankerous and impatient and rude and…and more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarely controlled anger showed in the tight set of his mouth. No one with any desire to advance in the Navy spoke to a senior officer the way Alison just had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s the matter, Commander, no comment?” Feet braced apart, she gave him a defiant glare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It would be best if you left now,” he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned as if he’d rarely been challenged, but Alison was beyond caring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t like me, Commander, and that’s perfectly okay, but I would prefer to keep personalities out of this. I am a professional and I pride myself on my work. Not only have you insulted me but you’ve—” Angry though she was, she couldn’t complete the thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes hardened, but he still wouldn’t look at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnable to bear another minute in his presence, she turned and walked away, feeling as though there was a huge hole in her stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Fifteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShana was in much better spirits the following weekend. Her business continued to prosper, and she’d hired a new part-time employee, a teenage boy this time, named Charles. Not Charlie, but Charles. Hiring, training and dealing with employees had proved to be her biggest difficulty to date. This was an area where she had little experience and it seemed her lessons were all learned the hard way. She’d had to let the other two go and seemed to feel worse about it than either teenager. Charles was proving himself to be responsible and good-natured, and he and Catherine liked each other, quickly developing a bantering relationship. Shana couldn’t even begin to imagine what she’d do without Catherine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter several weeks of hanging around the ice-cream parlor, Jazmine’s entrepreneurial talent suddenly kicked in, and her ideas weren’t bad. The kid had real imagination when it came to inventing sundaes and candy treats. She took long strands of red and black licorice and—hands carefully gloved—braided them, decorating each end with colorful ribbons. Then she enclosed the entire creation in cellophane wrap. She hung them everywhere she found space, creating a festive atmosphere. The price was reasonable and the kids who came into the parlor were intrigued by them, so they sold quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJazmine’s creativity had sparked Shana’s, and she made up and displayed small bouquets using colorful lollipops and ribbons. The candy business contributed only a small portion to the total revenue but was gaining in popularity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorking long hours had one advantage, Shana decided; she didn’t have time to think about Adam’s leaving. She was afraid it would be soon, and if she allowed herself to brood on it, she’d remember how much she enjoyed his company—and how much she was going to miss him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam still hadn’t mentioned the possibility of a transfer to Jazmine. Shana didn’t feel it was her place to tell Jazz, unless Adam wanted her to, but he agreed the news should come from him. He’d promised he would last weekend, but then for one reason or another, he hadn’t. Shana knew it would be hard to tell her and that he wanted to delay it until the transfer was official. She supposed it would be best to say nothing until he was sure. Her heart ached at the thought of Adam moving to Hawaii. Yes, it was a wonderful assignment and one he’d sought out, but Shana wanted him in Seattle, selfish though that was…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the height of the lunch business, when the restaurant smelled of baking dough and tomato sauce, and it was all Shana could do to keep up with the pizza orders, the phone rang. Catherine bustled over to answer it and her gaze flew to Shana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s for you,” she said, holding out the receiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShana finished slicing a sausage pizza still steaming hot from the oven. If it was Adam, she’d call back the minute she had time to breathe. “Who is it?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Adam, I think,” Catherine told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe realized he might have news; if so, she wanted to know as soon as possible. “Ask him if it’s important.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine grabbed the phone and as Shana watched, the older woman nodded at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer stomach tensed with anxiety. Shana could feel it coming even before he told her. Adam had received his transfer papers or whatever the Navy called them. That must be it; otherwise he would’ve phoned her tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWiping her hands on her apron, she asked Charles to fill in for her while she answered the phone. “Could you bring this pizza to table ten?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShana walked to the other side of the room and took the phone from Catherine. “Adam?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry to bother you now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned against the wall, hardly able to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen,” he said, and she could hear the regret in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could think of no reason to delay his news, so she said it before he had a chance. “You got the transfer to Hawaii.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, my orders hit the boards.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re official. And I have to fly out almost right away. The officer I’m replacing had an emergency.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere it was, what she’d dreaded most. “I see.” Shana closed her eyes. Although she’d known this was coming, she still felt a sense of shock. The tightness in her chest was painful, and she bit her lower lip to keep from protesting aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I fly out in the morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So soon?” She’d hoped they’d have some time to say their farewells. At least one more chance to talk and decide—not that there was really anything to decide. But it felt wrong for him to go like this, so quickly, without any opportunity for Jazmine or her to adjust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” She couldn’t seem to say more than two words at a time. “Tonight?” she managed through her painfully dry throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite her lack of clarity or detail, he understood the question. “Unfortunately, I can’t. There’s too much to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is Jazmine there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShana pressed her hand against her forehead. “No, she’s at the park skating with her friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You may need to tell her for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No!” Shana’s objection was immediate. “You have to do it.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/navy-husband-navy-6/page-20.html","bookId":1961,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:21 AM"}
