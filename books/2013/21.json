When he came opposite the cave mouth, he reached out until one hand gripped the edge of stone, then followed with a foot, stretching until the probing tip of his moccasin settled on the ledge. Then, in a swift shifting of weight, combined with a push away from the ladder, he fluidly spun on one leg, the other swinging over empty air. Then stepping inward, pulled by the weight of the satchel on his back, into the gloom, of the entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Nicely done,’ Silchas Ruin commented, and there was something like amusement in his tone, as if he had enjoyed the slave’s poking at Fear Sengar’s sententious self-importance, thus revealing two edges to his observation. ‘I urn of a mind to follow him.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Me, too,’ said Kettle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeren Pedac sighed. ‘Very well, but I suggest we use ropes between us, and leave the showing off to Udinaas.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mouth of the cave revealed that it had been a corridor, probably leading out onto a balcony before the facade had sheared off. Massive sections of the walls, riven through with cracks, had shifted, settled at conflicting angles. And every crevasse, every fissure on all sides that Seren could see, seethed with the squirming furred bodies of bats, awakened now to their presence, chittering and moments from panic. As Seren set her pack down, Udinaas moved beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Here,’ he said, his breath pluming, ‘light this lantern, Acquitor-when the temperature drops my hands start going numb.’ At her look he glanced over at Fear Sengar, then said, ‘Too many years reaching down into icy water. A slave among the Edur knows little comfort.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You were fed,’ Fear Sengar said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘When a bloodwood tree toppled in the forest,’ Udinaas said, ‘we’d be sent out to drag it back to the village. Do you remember those times, Fear? Sometimes the trunk would shift unexpectedly, slide in mud or whatever, and crush a slave. One of them was from our own household-you don’t recall him, do you? What’s one more dead slave? You Edur would shout out when that happened, saying the bloodwood spirit was thirsty for Letherii blood.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Enough, Udinaas,’ Seren said, finally succeeding in lighting the lantern. As the illumination burgeoned, the bats exploded from the cracks and suddenly the air was filled with frantic, beating wings. A dozen heartbeats later the creatures were gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe straightened, raising the lantern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stood on a thick mouldy paste-guano, crawling with grubs and beetles-from which rose a foul stench.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We’d better move in,’ Seren said, ‘and get clear of this. There are fevers…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man was screaming as the guards dragged him by his chains, across the courtyard to the ring-wall. His crushed feet left bloody smears on the pavestones. Screams of accusation wailed from him, shrill outrage at the shaping of the world-the Letherii world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanal Yathvanar snorted softly. ‘Hear him. Such naivety.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaros Invictad, standing beside him on the balcony, gave him a sharp look. ‘You foolish man, Tanal Yathvanar.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Invigilator?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaros Invictad leaned his forearms on the railing and squinted down at the prisoner. Fingers like bloated river-worms slowly entwined. From somewhere overhead a gull was laughing. ‘Who poses the greatest threat to the empire, Yathvanar?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Fanatics,’ Tanal replied after a moment. ‘Like that one below.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Incorrect. Listen to his words. He is possessed of certainty. He holds to a secure vision of the world, a man with the correct answers-that the prerequisite questions were themselves the correct ones goes without saying. A citizen with certainty, Yathvanar, can be swayed, turned, can be made into a most diligent ally. All one needs to do is find what threatens them the most. Ignite their fear, burn to cinders the foundations of their certainty, then offer an equally certain alternate way of thinking, of seeing the world. They will reach across, no matter how wide the gulf, and grasp and hold on to you with all their strength. No, the certain are not our enemies. Presently misguided, as in the case of the man below, but always most vulnerable to lean Take away the comfort of their convictions, then coax them with seemingly cogent and reasonable convictions of our own making. Their eventual embrace is assured.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I see.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Tanal Yathvanar, our greatest enemies are those who are without certainty. The ones with questions, the ones who regard our tidy answers with unquenchable scepticism. Those questions assail us, undermine us. They… agitate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstand, these dangerous citizens understand that nothing is simple; their stance is the very opposite of naivety. They are humbled by the ambivalence to which they are witness, and they defy our simple, comforting assertions of clarity, of a black and white world. Yathvanar, when you wish to deliver the gravest insult to such a citizen, call them naive. You will leave them incensed indeed, virtually speechless… until you watch their minds back-tracking, revealed by a cascade of expressions, as they ask themselves: who is it that would call me naive? Well, comes the answer, clearly a person possessing certainty with all the arrogance and pretension that position entails; a confidence, then, that permits the offhand judge ment, the derisive dismissal uttered from a most lofty height. And from all this, into your victim’s eyes will come the light of recognition-in you he faces his enemy, his truest enemy. And he will know fear. Indeed, terror.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-21.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
