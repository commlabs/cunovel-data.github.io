{"id":45600,"no":283,"title":"Chapter 281: Blood Stream Sect, Stand Down This Instant!","content":"\u003cp\u003ePatriarch Droughtflame’s reaction came very quickly, and almost immediately reversed the unfavorable situation which had just sprung up because of Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy defaming the Spirit Stream Sect, he gave the Blood Stream Sect cultivators a reason to sink back into rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three blood masters’ eyes glittered, and it was the same with Song Que and the other important figures in the sect. Three of the blood rippers, as well as some of the prime elders, unhesitatingly shot toward Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spirit Stream Sect’s founding patriarch laughed coldly. “Complete hogwash! Bai Xiaochun is a Heaven-Dao cultivator of the Spirit Stream Sect. However, he is young and naïve, and was clearly bewitched by your demonic magic! How dare you try to kidnap him right in front of me! Men, get Bai Xiaochun back to the mountains! I’ll personally expel the Blood Stream Sect’s demonic magic from within him!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost immediately, cultivators from the Spirit Stream Sect side sprang into action, including Li Qinghou, who shot forward at top speed toward Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLegacy echelon cultivators closed in, along with prime elders, barreling toward the Blood Stream Sect forces, preparing to unleash powerful attacks to fight over Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun was again the focus of the entire battlefield. Although he wasn’t of supreme importance to either sect, neither was willing to give him up easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Blood Stream Sect wanted to fight for Nightcrypt, to dispel the disadvantage that had appeared. As for the Spirit Stream Sect, they wanted Bai Xiaochun back, and to cause the Blood Stream Sect’s disadvantage to worsen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling echoed out through heaven and earth as the fighting once again broke out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp in the sky, the patriarchs were unleashing attacks. The legacy echelon cultivators were fighting with the blood rippers. Prime elders from both sides were unleashing magical techniques and items, causing bright light to fill the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Blood Stream Sect’s grand lich let loose a terrifying howl, and numerous refined corpses raced into motion. As they moved along, corpse auras spread out everywhere. Among those corpses, Bai Xiaochun could see some that belonged to him, and knew that he could force them to stand down. However... a few corpses among an army like that didn’t count for much. They were like a few grains of sand in a sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it came to the gargoyles, they cackled madly as they swept out from the Blood Stream Sect forces in preparation to attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there were the countless blood swords. As a blood master, Bai Xiaochun could suppress Middle Peak, but... there were multiple past blood masters who were now blood rippers. Although their level of control of the mountain peak couldn’t match up to the current blood master, by combining forces and drawing upon the support of the patriarchs, they quickly suppressed Bai Xiaochun’s blood master powers, allowing the Middle Peak cultivators to fight once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling filled heaven and earth as the body cultivators from Lesser Marsh Peak sprang into action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spirit Stream Sect’s spell formation giants roared into action as they charged toward the Blood Stream Sect. Killing intent erupted from Shangguan Tianyou’s giant, and it was the same with those controlled by Ghostfang, Gongsun Yun, Beihan Lie, Xu Song and Zhou Xinqi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCountless battle beasts from the north bank howled as they flew out, a tide of beasts that was shocking to behold. The Heavenhorn ink dragon roared, black flames erupting from his mouth, filling the sky and creating a sea of fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown below, more spell formation giants pounded across the ground toward the Blood Stream Sect army. As they closed in on each other, magical battle equipment was unleashed, causing everything to shake and tremble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHigher up in the sky, the Spirit Stream Sect’s white sun and the Blood Stream Sect’s scarecrow both began to emanate shocking fluctuations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bitter look could be seen in Bai Xiaochun’s eyes. Even revealing his status as blood master wasn’t enough to prevent the war from being fought. He looked around at all of the familiar faces fighting, and it made him feel like he was being torn apart inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do we have to fight...?” he murmured. “This war obviously doesn’t have to happen! Am I just not strong enough...? Is that why nobody will listen to me?” As he looked around, he realized the truth of the matter. Although both sects cared deeply about him, he simply wasn’t strong enough, and definitely not important enough, to influence a massive, deadly war like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, as far as he was concerned, if one sect wiped the other out, he would definitely see many familiar faces cut down, regardless of who came out victorious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he stood there trembling, he realized there was no backing down now. Nor did he need to. His cultivation base erupted as he flew up into the air, to once again stand between the two sides and roar, “I said... you people aren’t allowed to keep fighting!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice echoed out like thunder, and caused a few people to hesitate. However, the majority ignored him. As for Song Que, his smile grew even colder, and inside, he was mocking Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaster God-Diviner, Jia Lie and everyone else from Middle Peak were now freed from Bai Xiaochun’s blood master powers. Thanks to the blood rippers, they were now free to fight. Eyes flickering, hearts filled with all sorts of thoughts and feelings, they sprang into motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly Song Junwan maintained her silence, and didn’t attack. Because of the tears which still filled her eyes, her grief seemed even more profound than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun waved his sleeve, brushing away the first round of attacks levied against him. Bloodshot eyes filled with madness, he roared, “Didn’t you people hear me!? I said... you’re not allowed to keep fighting!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, his words were like a pebble tossed into a well, which would cause a few ripples on the surface of the water, but nothing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Song Clan patriarch sighed and said, “Nightcrypt, my son, don\u0027t waste your words. Your position makes you overly sensitive, so just leave the battlefield. There’s no need for you to fight in this war. You... can’t control what’s happening here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Patriarch Ironwood was fighting him with utter ferocity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spirit Stream Sect’s founding patriarch sighed inwardly, then said, “Xiaochun, since the Blood Stream Sect is determined to fight, then any words you speak are useless. I understand how you feel, so just go back to the Luochen Mountains. There’s no need for you to join in the fighting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Blood Stream Sect’s arch-patriarch attacked with greater force than before, even drawing upon some of his magical items.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBooms rose up into the air, and shockwaves spread out across the battlefield. Bai Xiaochun was shaking visibly as he looked around at the fighting. Finally, he lifted his right hand. He knew what he had to do now, and that it would likely be a disaster for the Blood Stream Sect. Memories from the Blood Stream Sect flitted through his mind, and yet, he had no other choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFilled with resolve, he threw his head back and let out a piercing howl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat howl contained the fluctuations of his cultivation base, the power of his Undying Live Forever Technique, and even more importantly, the accumulation of all the madness he felt in his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis blood qi erupted, rumbling out to form a gigantic blood-colored column of light that shot up into the air. Voice resonating with matchless dignity and splendor, he roared, “Blood Stream Sect, stand down this instant!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, he shoved his right hand out in the direction of the Blood Stream Sect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly, rumbling sounds filled heaven and earth, and the blood-colored light which surrounded him began to spread out rapidly. The heavens shook and the earth quaked as, in the blink of an eye, the light covered everything on the entire battlefield!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sky shook as a huge blood-colored vortex sprang into being, which then transformed into an indescribably large blood-colored arm. The arm filled the sky, and mirrored Bai Xiaochun’s own gesture, shoving toward the army from the Blood Stream Sect!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA matchless and awe-inspiring power immediately emanated out from the arm, causing intense pressure to instantly spring out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany people had already taken note of the huge hand. When the patriarchs of the Blood Stream Sect saw it, and especially the taciturn arch-patriarch, their faces immediately fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shoving motion of the hand instantly caused the cultivators of Lesser Marsh Peak to tremble. Their faces went pale and filled with expressions of astonishment as they realized that all of the techniques they cultivated were being thrown into utter chaos. It was like some unheard-of sealing mark were suddenly crushing down onto them!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the blink of an eye, the battle prowess of all Lesser Marsh Peak cultivators was unexpectedly reduced by half!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t just the Lesser Marsh Peak cultivators that were affected. Corpse Peak, Middle Peak, and Nameless Peak cultivators were all shocked, and began to cry out in alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on...?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My cultivation base is destabilizing!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is this possible!? My... my cultivation base is actually being sealed!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t just the cultivators on the battlefield who were affected. The refined corpses, the gargoyles, the blood swords, everything suffered from the crushing pressure. Screams of terror rang out. Even the blood clouds began to dim, and the blood swords began to dry up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the Blood Stream Sect patriarchs, their hearts and minds were spinning. To their shock, they found that even their cultivation bases were being suppressed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir very essences were being affected, making it impossible to fight back against the pressure!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone who practiced any cultivation that was connected to the Blood Ancestor... could not avoid this curse!!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-280\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-282\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-281","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:09 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:09 AM"}
