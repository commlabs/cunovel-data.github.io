Unconsciously, she extended both her hands, feeling them clasped firmly in Paul\u0027s strong, warm ones. In the last four years, she had rehearsed dozens of clever things to say when this moment finally arrived; but looking up at his beloved, handsome face, all she could say was, \"Hello, Paul.\" A slow, appreciative smile worked its way across his face as he tucked her hand in the crook of his arm. \"Dance with me,\" he said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrembling inside, Whitney stepped into Paul\u0027s arms and felt his hand glide around her waist, gathering her closer. Beneath her fingertips, his beautiful dark blue jacket seemed to be a living thing that her fingers ached to slide over and caress. She knew that now was the time to be the poised, light-hearted female she\u0027d been in Paris, but her thoughts were jumbled and erratic, as if part of her was fifteen years old again. All she wanted to say was, \"I love you. I have always loved you. Now do you want me? Have I changed enough for you to want me?\" \"Did you miss me?\" Paul asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarning bells went off in Whitney\u0027s head as she heard the thread of confidence in his tone. Instinctively, she gave him a provocative sidewise smile. \"I missed you desperately!\" she declared with enough extra emphasis to make it seem a gross exaggeration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How \u0027desperately\u0027?\" Paul persisted, his grin widening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was utterly desolate,\" Whitney teased, knowing full well that Emily had regaled him with stories of her popularity in Paris. \"In fact, I nearly wasted away in loneliness for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liar.\" He chuckled, his hand on her waist tightening possessively. \"That\u0027s not what I heard this morning. Did you, or did you not, tell some French nobleman that if you were as impressed with his title as you were with his conceit, you\u0027d be tempted to accept his offer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhitney nodded slowly, her tips twitching with laughter. \"I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I ask what his offer was?\" Paul said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you may not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should I call him out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhitney felt as if she was dancing on air. Should he call him out? Paul was flirting with her, actually fluting with her!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is Elizabeth?\" Before the words were past her lips, she cursed herself in French and English. And when she saw the satisfied smile sweeping across Paul\u0027s face, she felt like stamping her foot in self-disgust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll find her and bring her over, so you can see for yourself,\" Paul offered, the knowing smile lingering in his eyes as the musk wound to a close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhitney was still trying to recover from the humiliation of her hideous blunder when she realized that Paul was guiding her directly toward Clayton Westland\u0027s group. Until that moment, she\u0027d entirely forgotten that she\u0027d turned her back on him when he was asking her to dance, and had strolled off with Paul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe I stole Miss Stone away when you were about to request a dance, Clayton,\" Paul said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering her earlier rudeness, Whitney couldn\u0027t see any way to avoid dancing with her loathsome neighbor now. She waited for Clayton to repeat the invitation, but he did nothing of the sort. With everyone witnessing her chagrin, Clayton let her stand there until she flushed with angry embarrassment. Then he offered his arm and said in a bored, unenthusiastic voice, \"Miss Stone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you,\" Whitney said coldly. \"I don\u0027t care to dance, Mr. Westland.\" Turning on her heel she walked off toward the opposite end of the room, putting as much space as possible between herself and that boorish clod, and joined a group of people that included Aunt Anne. She had been standing there for perhaps five minutes when her father appeared at her elbow and drew her away. \"There is someone I want you to meet,\" he said with gruff determination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite his tone, Whitney could tell that he was very proud of her tonight, and she accompanied him gladly as he skirted around the perimeter of the ballroom . . . until she realized where he was taking her. Directly ahead, Clayton Westland was engaged in laughing conversation with Emily and her husband. Margaret Merryton still clung to his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Father, please!\" Whitney whispered urgently, drawing back. \"I don\u0027t like him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be absurd!\" he snapped irritably, forcibly pulling her the rest of the way. \"Here she is,\" he told Clayton Westland in a booming, jovial voice. He turned to Whitney and said, as if she were nine years old, \"Make your curtsy and say \u0027how do\u0027 to our friend and neighbor, Mr. Clayton Westland.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve already met,\" Clayton said drily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve met,\" Whitney echoed weakly. Her cheeks burned as she endured Clayton\u0027s mocking gaze. If he said or did anything to embarrass her in front of her father, Whitney thought she would murder him. For the first time in her life, her father was seeing her as an accepted, and acceptable, human being, and he was proud of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well good. Good,\" her father said, looking expectantly from Whitney to Clayton. \"Then why don\u0027t you two dance? That\u0027s what this music is for-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reason they weren\u0027t going to dance, Whitney instantly realized, was because it was obvious from Clayton\u0027s aloof expression that he wouldn\u0027t ask her to dance again if someone held a gun to his head. Feeling lower than an insect, Whitney made herself look imploringly at him, and then at the dance floor, in an unmistakable invitation to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brows arched in ironic amusement. For one hideous moment, Whitney thought he intended to ignore her invitation, but he shrugged instead and, without so much as offering her his arm, he strolled toward the dance floor, leaving her to follow or remain standing there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhitney followed him, but she loathed him every single step of the way for making her do it. Trailing along in his wake, she stared daggers at the back of his wine-colored jacket, but until he turned toward her, she didn\u0027t realize that he was laughing-actually laughing at her mortification!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhitney stepped toward him, then right past him, fully intending to leave him standing there in the middle of the dancers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand shot out and captured her elbow. \"Don\u0027t you dare!\" he growled, laughing as he drew her around to face him for the waltz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was excessively kind of you to ask me to dance,\" Whitney remarked sarcastically as she stepped reluctantly into his arms. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/whitney-my-love-westmoreland-saga-2/page-27.html","bookId":1804,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:29 PM"}
