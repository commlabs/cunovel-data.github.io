The necessity to elude authorities meant that a big match might be shifted from town to town at the last minute, with vast crowds of pugilistic enthusiasts and sporting bloods following all over the countryside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe match on November 19th between Smashing Tim Revels, the Fighting Quaker, and the challenger, Neddy Singleton, was moved from Liverpool to a small town called Eagle Welles, and eventually to Barrington, outside Manchester. The fight was attended by more than twenty thousand supporters, who found the spectacle unsatisfactory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn those days, the P.R., or prize ring, had rules that would make the event almost unrecognizable to modern eyes. Fighting was done bare-fisted by the combatants, who were careful to regulate their blows in order to avoid injury to their own hands and wrists; a man who broke his knuckles or wrists early in a contest was almost certain to lose. Rounds were of variable duration, and the fights had no prearranged length. They often went fifty or even eighty rounds, thus lasting the better part of a day. The object of the sport was for each man slowly and methodically to injure his opponent with a succession of small cuts and welts; knockouts were not sought. On the contrary, the proper fighter literally battered his opponent into submission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeddy Singleton was hopelessly outclassed by Smashing Tim from the start. Early in the fight, Neddy adopted the ruse of dropping to one knee whenever he was struck, in order to halt the fight and allow him to catch his breath. The spectators hissed and booed this ungentlemanly trick, but nothing could be done to prevent it, especially as the referee--- charged with giving the count of ten--- called out the numbers with a slowness that demonstrated he\u0027d been paid off smartly by Neddy\u0027s backers. The indignation of the fans was tempered, at least, by the recognition that this chicanery had the side affect of prolonging the bloody spectacle they had all come to witness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith thousands of spectators standing about, including every manner of coarse and brutal ruffian, the men of the Yard were at some pains to operate unobtrusively. Agar, with a revolver at his spine, pointed out Pierce and the guard Burgess from a distance. The two men were than apprehended with great adroitness: a barker was pressed to each man\u0027s side, with whispered suggestion that they come along quietly or take a bit of lead for their trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce greeted Agar amiably. \"Turned nose, did you?\" he asked with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgar could not meet his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t matter,\" Pierce said. \"I\u0027ve thought of this as well, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had no choice,\" Agar blurted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll lose your share,\" Pierce said calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the periphery of the P.R. crowd, Pierce was brought before Mr. Harranby of the Yard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you Edward Pierce, also known as John Simms?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am,\" the man replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are under arrest on a charge of robbery,\" Mr. Harranby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo this Pierce replied, \"You\u0027ll never hold me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I fancy that I will, sir,\" Mr. Harranby said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy nightfall on November 19th, both Pierce and Burgess were, along with Agar, in Newgate\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrison. Harranby quietly informed government officials of his success, but there was no announcement to the press, for Harranby wanted to apprehend the woman known as Miriam, and the cabby Barlow, both still at large. He also wanted to recover the money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 50 Winkling Out\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn November 22nd, Mr. Harranby interrogated Pierce for the first time. The diary of his assistant, Jonathan Sharp, records that \"H. arrived in office early, most carefully attired and looking his best. Had cup of coffee instead of usual tea. Comments on how best to deal with Pierce, etc., etc. Said that he suspected nothing could be got from Pierce without softening up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, the interview was remarkably brief. At nine o\u0027clock in the morning, Pierce was ushered into the office and asked to sit in a chair, isolated in the middle of the room. Harranby, from behind his desk, directed his first question with customary abruptness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know the man called Barlow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Pierce said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is he now?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is the woman called Miriam?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where,\" said Mr. Harranby, \"is the money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems that there is a good deal you don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Pierce said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarranby appraised him for a moment. There was a short silence. \"Perhaps,\" Harranby said, \"a time in the Steel will strengthen your powers of memory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt it,\" Pierce said, with no sign of anxiety. Soon after, he was taken from the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlone with Sharp, Harranby said, \"I shall break him, you may be sure of that.\" The same day, Harranby arranged for Pierce to be transferred from Newgate Prison to the House of Correction at Coldbath Fields, also called the Bastille. \"The Steel\" was not ordinarily a holding place for accused criminals awaiting trial. But it was a frequent ruse for police to send a man there if some information had to be \"winkled out\" of him before the trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Steel was the most dreaded of all English prisons. In a visit in 1853, Henry Mayhew described its features. Chief among them, of course, were the cockchafers, narrow boxes in a row with \"the appearance of the stalls in a public urinal,\" where prisoners remained for fifteen-minute intervals, treading down a wheel of twenty-four steps. A warder explained the virtues of the cockchafer in this way: \"You see the men can get no firm tread like, from the steps always sinking away from under their feet and that makes it very tiring. Again the compartments are small, and the air becomes very hot, so that the heat at the end of a quarter of an hour renders it difficult to breathe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven less pleasant was shot-drill, an exercise so rigorous that men over forty-five were usually exempted. In this, the prisoners formed a circle with three paces separating each. At a signal, each man picked up a twenty-four-pound cannonball, carried it to his neighbor\u0027s place, dropped it, and returned to his original position where another shot awaited him. The drill went on for an hour at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost feared of all was \"the crank,\" a drum filled with sand and turned with a crank handle. It was usually reserved as a special punishment for unruly prisoners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe daily regimen of Coldbath Fields was so debilitating that even after a shot sentence of six months, many a man emerged \"with the steel gone out of him\" his body damaged, nerves shot, and resolution so enfeebled that his ability to commit further crimes was severely impaired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a prisoner awaiting trial, Pierce could not be made to undergo the stepper, the shot-drill, or the crank; but he was obliged to follow the rules of prison conduct, and if he broke the rule of silence, for example, he might be punished by a time at the crank. Thus one may presume that the guards frequently accused him of speaking, and he was treated to \"softening up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn December 19th, after four weeks in the Steel, Pierce was again brought to Harranby\u0027s office. Harranby had told Sharp that \"now we shall see a thing or two,\" but the second interrogation turned out to be as brief as the first:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is the man Barlow?\"\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is the woman Miriam?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is the money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Harranby, coloring deeply, the veins standing out on his forehead, dismissed Pierce with a voice filled with rage. As Pierce was taken away, he calmly wished Mr. Harranby a pleasant Christmas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The cheek of the man,\" Harranby later recorded, \"was beyond all imagining.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Harranby during this period was under considerable pressure from several fronts. The bank of Huddleston \u0026amp; Bradford wanted its money back, and made its feelings known to Harranby through the offices of none other than the Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston himself. The inquiry from \"Old Pam\" was in itself embarrassing, for Harranby had to admit that he had put Pierce in Coldbath Fields, and the implications of that were none too gentlemanly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePalmerston expressed the opinion that it was \"a bit irregular,\" but Harranby consoled himself with the thought that any Prime Minister who dyed his whiskers was hardly in a position to berate others for dissembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePierce remained in Coldbath until February 6th, when he was again brought before Harranby.,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is the man Barlow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is the woman Miriam?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is the money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a crypt, in Saint John\u0027s Wood,\" Pierce said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarranby sat forward. \"What was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is stored,\" Pierce said blandly, \"in a crypt in the name of John Simms, in the cemetery of Martin Lane, Saint John\u0027s Wood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarranby drummed his fingers on the desk. \"Why have you not come forth with this information earlier?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not want to,\" Pierce said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarranby ordered Pierce taken away to Coldbath Fields once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn February 7th, the crypt was located, and the appropriate dispensations obtained to open it. Mr. Harranby, accompanied by a representative of the bank; Mr. Henry Fowler, opened the vault at noon that day. There was no coffin in the crypt--- and neither was there any gold. Upon re-examination of the crypt door, it appeared that the lock had been recently forced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Fowler was extremely angry at the discovery, and Mr. Harranby was extremely embarrassed. On February 8th, the following day, Pierce was returned to Harranby\u0027s office and told the news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why,\" Pierce said, \"the villains must have robbed me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice and manner did riot suggest any great distress, and Harranby said so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Barlow,\" Pierce said. \"I always knew he was not to be trusted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you believe it was Barlow who took the money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who else could it be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a short silence. Harranby listened to the ticking of his clock; for once, it irritated him more than his subject. Indeed, his subject appeared remarkably at ease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you not care,\" Harranby said, \"that your confederates have turned on you in this fashion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just my ill luck,\" Pierce said calmly. \"And yours,\" he added, with a slight smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By his collected manner and polished demeanour,\" Harranby wrote, \"I presumed that he had fabricated still another tale to put us off the mark. But in further attempts to learn the truth I was frustrated, for on the first of March, 1857, the Times reporter learned of Pierces capture, and he could no longer conveniently be held in custody.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Mr. Sharp, his chief received the newspaper story of Pierce\u0027s capture \"with heated imprecation and ejaculations.\" Harranby demanded to know how the papers had been put on to the story. The Times refused to divulge its source. A guard at Coldbath who was thought to have given out the information was discharged, but nobody was ever certain one way or the other. Indeed; it was even rumored that the lead had come from Palmerston\u0027s office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, the trial of Burgess, Agar, and Pierce was set to begin on July 12, 1857. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-great-train-robbery/page-36.html","bookId":2678,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:35 AM"}
