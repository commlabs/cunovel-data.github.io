After drinking some water, he slowly closed his eyes. He finally felt that he did something useful, not purely being just a burden. The moulding ability was indeed powerful, but it actually only had three levels. Kane had been accumulating evolutionary points this entire time. Right now, his genetic sequence strength and accommodation degree were already equivalent to 14 evolutionary points. After a bit longer, the Moulding ability would be advanced. Kane had always been distressed that his fighting power wasn’t great, while this troop’s enemies were powerful to the point where he couldn’t even join the battles. Even though by continuously using the moulding ability, he would also slowly improve, it was still much too slower when compared to slaughter.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eDuring this time when one couldn’t even be sure if they would live to see tomorrow, time, was the most precious thing.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eMadeline finally changed her stance, changing from a direct slice to a horizontal hold.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLi Gaolei took out the cigarette that only had a third of its former self left. However, this time, he didn’t light it and instead brought it to his nose to smell it before sighing with satisfaction. He, who was used to life in the wilderness, knew that perhaps after a few days, smoking would become an absolute luxury.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAt that time, that completely wasteful girl Li would have probably already smoked all it, right?

Then, without any hesitation, she then reached her hand into Li Gaolei’s pocket for a lighter.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe only one that could act this unbridled was naturally Li. She lit what was left of the cigarette, took a deep breath, holding it in for a while before slowly breathing it out and saying, “Good stuff!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“You ran out of things to smoke already?” Li Gaolei asked somewhat helplessly. Even though he did intend to save this small half of the cigarette for Li, he never thought that she would smoke it all this fast. One has to understand that Li had more than ten times the number of smokes compared to him. There was one other smoker in the group, and that was Su. However, ever since they began to escape, Su no longer touched them, instead giving all of his own portion to Li and Li Gaolei.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLi nodded and said, “\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eEn\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e, I’ve been feeling on edge recently, so I smoked a bit more.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“This is the last one you know.” Li’s words suddenly made Li stare blankly. Then, she took another hit of the cigarette butt she was originally going to throw away, lighting the final bit of the tobacco before reluctantly throwing it onto the ground and crushing it under her boots.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLi took a deep breath, and then her pretty face suddenly produced a resolute brilliance. She looked towards Madeline that was standing like a statue in the distance and suddenly said, “You stand a bit farther. Don’t look this way!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLi Gaolei stared blankly, and then he looked out towards where Li was looking. His face couldn’t help but produce a strange expression. “Li, what are you trying to do?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“I’m going to have a good talk with that little girl! We are going to talk on our own!” Li suddenly squeezed out these words from the gaps of her teeth, strictly emphasizing the words ‘our own’.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe smile on Li Gaolei’s face immediately became bitter. He said with a pleading voice, “You?... you want to discuss something with Madeline? She is only sixteen years old and only has two levels of ability! Let’s just forget it, leader definitely won’t be happy if he finds out.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen he said the last sentence, Li Gaolei immediately regretted it. Li’s face immediately became cold, and then with a piercing gaze, she stared at Li Gaolei, saying, “I am only nineteen years old! I’m not that much older than her. I know she only has two levels of ability, but if I don’t do it now, I might never have the chance again! If you dare stop me, I don’t mind putting you down first! However, you can relax, I know what is appropriate and won’t injure her. Right now, you go off to the side!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs he watched the duty-bound Li walk towards Madeline, Li Gaolei opened his mouth, but nothing came out. He never thought that Li would suddenly take action now. If Su came back and saw this, he definitely wouldn’t be happy. However, Su left for especially long today. Perhaps Li’s female intuition told her that Su wouldn’t return that early, and that was why she chose to move now, right?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLi Gaolei only saw Li walk over, pat the shoulders of Madeline who was quite a bit taller than herself, and then say something by her ears before walking together with her into the forest depths. Right now, other than laughing bitterly, he could do little more than only laugh bitterly. He finally left the large tree he had been leaning on this entire time, and with a shake of his head, he walked towards the opposite direction.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSigh\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e, that dumb girl!
