Then he threaded his fingers through the triangle of curling hair. Damned if he would ever tell Eugene or any other man that Octavia was, indeed, a natural redhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not wearing any panties,\" he said against her bare shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was in a hurry when I left the cottage tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I may go crazy here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile played at the edges of her mouth. She started to unfasten his shirt. \"Because I forgot to put on a pair of panties?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t take much to drive me over the edge when I\u0027m this close to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe separated the edges of his shirt and flattened her palms against his chest. \"I\u0027m not feeling wholly sane myself at the moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe eased her backward, kissing her with every step, until she came up against the high bed. The ghostly bed curtains drifted gently behind her, guarding the interior of the secret bower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not take his mouth from hers when he reached behind her to pull the hazy fabric aside. Grasping the quilt, he pulled it straight down to the foot of the bed, exposing pristine white sheets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked her up, put her down on the pale bedding, and stepped back to finish undressing himself. The wispy bed hangings drifted closed. On the other side of the veil Octavia watched him through the misty material. She lay on her side, knees slightly bent, hips curved in graceful, seductive lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood there for a few seconds, every muscle rigid with the effort it took to exert some control over the aching, raging need that was uncoiling rapidly throughout his body. It had never been like this with any other woman, he thought, baffled and bemused. He could not seem to wrap his mind around this sensation. It was not just physical. He was old enough and sufficiently experienced to take the physical effects in stride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something else going on here. He knew that in the depths of his soul. He\u0027d been trying to ignore it, work around it, deny it, but there was no possibility of avoiding the reality. Octavia was different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her through the drifting veils that surrounded the bed, and for a moment he wondered if she really was a sorceress who had somehow managed to enchant him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no time to wonder about his predicament. The heaviness of his erection made it impossible to think clearly. He fought his way out of the rest of his clothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he pulled the bed hangings aside the second time, Octavia reached for him, drawing him down onto the snowy sheets. He put one hand on the sweet, round curve of her hip and she twisted urgently against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not so fast,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she was moving, sliding, slipping along the length of him. He felt her mouth on his chest and then her tongue touched his belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her fingers curled around him and her lips moved lower, he thought he disintegrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled her onto her back, pinning her with one leg thrown across her thighs. \"I meant what I said. We\u0027re going to take this nice and slow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we?\" Her voice was both mischievous and sensual. A woman who knows she\u0027s in control of the situation. She wriggled a little beneath his weight. \"Do you really want to go slow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Most definitely,\" he said. \"I want to go slow tonight. And what\u0027s more, I\u0027m going to make sure that we do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drew her fingertips down the length of his back. \"Wanna bet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bent his head and covered her mouth with his own. When she was absorbed in the kiss, giving herself completely over to it, working her sorcery, he reached out and snagged one of the trailing bed hangings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looped the fabric around her left wrist and tied a quick knot in it. \"Ummph?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wrenched her mouth away from his. Her eyes snapped open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grasped a wispy hanging on the opposite side of the bed and anchored her other wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my.\" She looked up at him, sexy laughter sparkling in her eyes. \"This is interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned over her, bracing his weight on his elbows. \"I thought so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All this just to slow me down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a desperate man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could pull the airy bed hangings down and free herself with a couple of quick tugs, but somehow he didn\u0027t think she would do that. He sensed that she was in a mood to walk on the wild side tonight. He could tell because he was inclined in the same direction. A shining example of synchronicity at work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happens next?\" she murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" He slid one hand between her legs and found the pearl in the oyster. He smiled when he felt her move beneath him, seeking more. \"Shall we find out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes.\" She licked her lips and looked up at him through veiled lashes. \"Let\u0027s do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stroked her slowly, dampening his hand in her dew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted her hips against his fingers, tempting him with her body. She could have lured an angel into trouble. And he was no angel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved down her body with his mouth, going lower until her scent enveloped him. He was so hard now he dared not brush his erection against her skin for fear of losing the fragile grip on his self-control. This was going to be a test of endurance and he was determined to make sure that he won tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually, when she was moaning and restless, he found the small, sensitive nubbin with his mouth. She caught her breath and tensed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe used his tongue until she was gasping and writhing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, please, yes. Now, damn it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slid a finger into her, searching for the spot; pressed upward. She gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Right there. Oh, yes. Oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes. Nick\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe came in shuddering little waves of raw, feminine energy that took his breath away. He barely made it back up her body in time to sink himself fully into her before his own climax ripped through him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe jerked her arms abruptly and then her nails were in his back and her legs were wrapped snugly around his hips. The last thing he remembered was the feel of the bed hangings floating down like so many silken cobwebs, tangling him in a snare he did not think that he would ever be able to escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came back to his senses a long time later. For a moment he did not open his eyes, preferring to savor the satisfaction that hummed through him. He was content to drift forever in the aftermath of the lovemaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he felt the soft touch of gauzy fabric twining around his right wrist. He opened one eye. Octavia\u0027s br**sts brushed across his chest when she leaned over him to secure his other wrist to the bedpost. He opened his other eye. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-60.html","bookId":1793,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM"}
