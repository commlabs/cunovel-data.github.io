I\u0027d known assumptions would be made, but I wanted more than ever to avoid further humiliation. \"Gideon\u0027s acquainted with my mother and she\u0027d already arranged for me to come, so it\u0027s just a matter of two people going to the same event in one car rather than two.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re available?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath, feeling uncomfortable despite how fluidly we moved together. \"Well, I\u0027m not taken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChristopher flashed his charismatic boyish grin. \"My night just took a turn for the better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe filled the rest of the dance with amusing anecdotes about the music industry that made me laugh and took my mind off Gideon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the dance ended, Cary was there to take the next one. We danced very well as a couple because we\u0027d taken lessons together. I relaxed into his hold, grateful to have him as moral support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you enjoying yourself?\" I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I pinched myself during dinner when I realized I was sitting next to the top coordinator for Fashion Week. And she flirted with me!\" He smiled, but his eyes were haunted. \"Whenever I find myself in places like this...dressed like this...I can\u0027t believe it. You saved my life, Eva. Then you changed it completely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You save my sanity all the time. Trust me, we\u0027re even.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand tightened on mine, his gaze hardening. \"You look miserable. How\u0027d he f**k up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I did that. We\u0027ll talk about it later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re afraid I\u0027ll kick his ass here in front of everyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"I\u0027d rather you didn\u0027t, for my mom\u0027s sake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCary pressed his lips briefly to my forehead. \"I warned him earlier. He knows it\u0027s coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Cary.\" Love for him tightened my throat even as reluctant amusement curved my lips. I should\u0027ve known Cary would give Gideon a big brother threat of some sort. That was just so like him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon appeared beside us. \"I\u0027m cutting in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t a request.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCary stopped and looked at me. I nodded. He backed away with a bow, his gaze hot and fierce on Gideon\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon pulled me close and took over the dance the way he took over everything - with dominant confidence. It was an entirely different experience dancing with him than with my two previous partners. Gideon had both the expertise of his brother and Cary\u0027s familiarity with the way my body moved, but Gideon had a bold, aggressive style that was inherently sexual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t help that being so close to a man I\u0027d so recently been intimate with seduced my senses despite my unhappiness. He smelled scrumptious, with undertones of sex, and the way he led me through the bold sweeping steps made me feel the soreness deep inside me, reminding me that he\u0027d been there not long ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You keep running off,\" he muttered, scowling down at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seemed like Magdalene picked up the slack quick enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brow arched and he drew me closer. \"Jealous?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seriously?\" I looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a frustrated noise. \"Stay away from my brother, Eva.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I said so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy temper ignited, which felt good after all the self-recrimination and doubts I\u0027d been drowning in since we\u0027d screwed like feral bunnies. I decided to see if turnabout was fair play in Gideon Cross\u0027s world. \"Stay away from Magdalene, Gideon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis jaw tightened. \"She\u0027s just a friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meaning you haven\u0027t slept with her...? Yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, damn it. And I don\u0027t want to. Listen - \" The music wound down and he slowed. \"I have to go. I brought you here, and I would prefer to be the one who takes you home, but I don\u0027t want to pull you away if you\u0027re enjoying yourself. Would you rather stick around and go home with Stanton and your mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnjoying myself? Was he kidding or clueless? Or worse. Maybe he\u0027d written me off so completely that he wasn\u0027t paying attention to me at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pushed away from him, needing the distance. His scent was messing with my head. \"I\u0027ll be fine. Forget about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eva.\" He reached for me and I stepped back quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn arm came around my back and Cary spoke. \"I\u0027ve got her, Cross.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t get in my way, Taylor,\" Gideon warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCary snorted. \"I get the impression you\u0027re doing a smokin\u0027 job of that all by yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed past the lump in my throat. \"You gave a wonderful speech, Gideon. It was the highlight of my evening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sucked in a sharp breath at the implied insult; then shoved a hand through his hair. Abruptly, he cursed and I realized why when he pulled his vibrating phone out of his pocket and glanced at the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to go.\" His gaze caught mine and held it. His fingertips drifted over my cheek. \"I\u0027ll call you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to stay?\" Cary asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take you home, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, don\u0027t.\" I wanted to be alone for a bit. Soak in a hot bath with a bottle of cool wine and pull myself out of my funk. \"You should be here. It could be good for your career. We can talk when you get home. Or tomorrow. I\u0027m going the couch potato route all day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze darted over my face, searching. \"You sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\" But he looked unconvinced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you could go out and ask a valet to have Stanton\u0027s limo brought around, I\u0027ll run to the ladies\u0027 room real quick.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-30.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
