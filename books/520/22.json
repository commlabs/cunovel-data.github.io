{"id":44688,"no":22,"title":"LOCK WILLOW FARM, Saturday night","content":"Dearest Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027ve only just come and I\u0027m not unpacked, but I can\u0027t wait to tell you\n\u003cbr\u003e how much I like farms. This is a heavenly, heavenly, HEAVENLY spot! \n\u003cbr\u003e The house is square like this: And OLD. A hundred years or so. \n\u003cbr\u003e It has a veranda on the side which I can\u0027t draw and a sweet porch\n\u003cbr\u003e in front. The picture really doesn\u0027t do it justice--those things\n\u003cbr\u003e that look like feather dusters are maple trees, and the prickly ones\n\u003cbr\u003e that border the drive are murmuring pines and hemlocks. It stands\n\u003cbr\u003e on the top of a hill and looks way off over miles of green meadows\n\u003cbr\u003e to another line of hills.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That is the way Connecticut goes, in a series of Marcelle waves;\n\u003cbr\u003e and Lock Willow Farm is just on the crest of one wave. The barns\n\u003cbr\u003e used to be across the road where they obstructed the view, but a kind\n\u003cbr\u003e flash of lightning came from heaven and burnt them down.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The people are Mr. and Mrs. Semple and a hired girl and two hired men. \n\u003cbr\u003e The hired people eat in the kitchen, and the Semples and Judy\n\u003cbr\u003e in the dining-room. We had ham and eggs and biscuits and honey\n\u003cbr\u003e and jelly-cake and pie and pickles and cheese and tea for supper--\n\u003cbr\u003e and a great deal of conversation. I have never been so entertaining\n\u003cbr\u003e in my life; everything I say appears to be funny. I suppose it is,\n\u003cbr\u003e because I\u0027ve never been in the country before, and my questions are\n\u003cbr\u003e backed by an all-inclusive ignorance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The room marked with a cross is not where the murder was committed,\n\u003cbr\u003e but the one that I occupy. It\u0027s big and square and empty,\n\u003cbr\u003e with adorable old-fashioned furniture and windows that have to\n\u003cbr\u003e be propped up on sticks and green shades trimmed with gold that\n\u003cbr\u003e fall down if you touch them. And a big square mahogany table--\n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m going to spend the summer with my elbows spread out on it,\n\u003cbr\u003e writing a novel.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Oh, Daddy, I\u0027m so excited! I can\u0027t wait till daylight to explore. \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s 8.30 now, and I am about to blow out my candle and try to go\n\u003cbr\u003e to sleep. We rise at five. Did you ever know such fun? I can\u0027t\n\u003cbr\u003e believe this is really Judy. You and the Good Lord give me more\n\u003cbr\u003e than I deserve. I must be a very, very, VERY good person to pay. \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m going to be. You\u0027ll see.\n\u003cbr\u003e Good night,\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PS. You should hear the frogs sing and the little pigs squeal\n\u003cbr\u003e and you should see the new moon! I saw it over my right shoulder.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59744.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
