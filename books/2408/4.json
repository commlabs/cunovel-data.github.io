{"id":74834,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\u003cp\u003eGraves worked for two years in the Army as a Slavic translator, and after his discharge joined the State Department in the same capacity. The pay was good and the work was interesting; he had the feeling of being useful, of doing necessary and even important work. In 1959 he married a girl on Senator Westlake\u0027s staff. They had a daughter in 1961. They got divorced two years later. He had a kidney stone and spent five days in the hospital. He met a nice girl, almost married her, but didn\u0027t. He bought a new car. He moved to a new apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn retrospect, these seemed to be the signposts, the significant shifts and alterations in his life. The years went by: he wore his hair a little longer, but the hair was thinner, exposing more of his temples. His trousers got tight, then flared, and now were baggy again, as they had been in the fifties. There were cyclic changes in himself and his world - but he was still working for the government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eState no longer wanted Russian translators. The big push was for Chinese and Japanese translators. Graves transferred into Intelligence, a division of State that was highly mathematical, heavily computerized. He worked in the foreign division for five years, doing a lot of code breaking. At that time the foreign embassies were all utilizing computer-generated codes of various kinds, and it was challenging work - even if the messages usually turned out to be requests for funds to refurbish the ballroom on the second floor, or to hire additional kitchen help. Graves was interested in the codes, not in the content.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 1970 he was moved to the domestic end. It seemed a minor change at the time, and a change he welcomed. He was ready to do something different. It was a long time before he realized just how different it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring his fifteen years in the government, slowly and imperceptibly his enemy had shifted from the Big Bear, the Russkies, the Reds, the ChiComs - to his fellow Americans. That was his job now, and he hated it. It was tapping telephone transmissions and competing with other agencies; it was value judgements and it was very, very political.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing was clean and direct any more. And Graves didn\u0027t like it. Not any more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves had been planning to quit State for a long time, ever since his domestic work had become distasteful. But he hadn\u0027t quit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat kept him was partly inertia and partly the fear that he might be unable to teach Slavic or mathematics. At least, that was what he told himself. He was reluctant to admit the real reason, even to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fact was that he took a genuine pleasure in his work. The pleasure was abstract, the pleasure of a compulsive jigsaw puzzle worker who will fit the pieces together without caring what the puzzle really means. It was a game he loved to play, even if it was fundamentally nasty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also liked the notion of an opponent. In the foreign division he had been up against institutions -embassies, foreign press corps, political groups of various kinds. In the domestic division, it was most often a single individual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves had long ago discovered his skill at poker, backgammon, and chess - games which required a combination of mathematical insight, memory, and psychological daring. To him the ideal was chess -one man pitted against another man, each trying to calculate the intentions of the other in a game of enormous complexity with many alternatives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was why he had agreed to leave Washington in order to follow the activities of John Wright. In the realm of puzzles and games, nothing was more challenging than John Wright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and Wright were well matched: the same intelligence, the same mathematical background, the same fondness for games, particularly chess and poker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now after three months, Phelps was rolling him up. Wright would be arrested; the game would be called off. Graves sighed, trying to tell himself that this did not represent a personal defeat. Yet it was; he knew it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a low whine the plane began its descent towards San Diego, skimming in over the roofs of the highest buildings. Graves didn\u0027t much like San Diego. It was a utilitarian town dominated by the needs of the Navy, which ran it with a firm, conservative hand. Even its sins were dreary: the downtown area was filled with bars, pool halls, and porno movie houses which advertised `Beaver films - direct from Frisco!\u0027 as if San Francisco were six thousand miles away and not just an hour up the coast. Fresh-faced sailors wandered all over the downtown area looking for something to do. They never seemed to understand that there was nothing to do. Except, possibly, to get drunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the early hour San Diego was hot, and Graves was grateful for the car\u0027s air conditioning. Lewis drove away from the airport, glancing occasionally at Graves. `The marshals checked in with us an hour ago.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`So you know?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Everybody knows. They\u0027re just waiting for you to say the word.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they left the airport they passed beneath a banner stretched across the road: WELCOME REPUBLICANS. Graves smiled. `I\u0027m going to hold off for a while,\u0027 he said. `At least until this afternoon.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis nodded and said nothing. Graves liked that about him, his silence. He was young and enthusiastic - characteristics Graves severely lacked - but he knew when to keep his mouth shut. `We\u0027ll go directly to his apartment,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`All right,\u0027 Lewis said. He didn\u0027t ask why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`What time did Wright quit last night?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Nine. Lights out at nine.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Rather early.\u0027 Graves frowned. It was rare for Wright to go to bed before midnight.,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Duly noted on the time-clock sheets,\u0027 Lewis said. `I checked them myself this morning.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Has he ever done that before? Gone to bed at nine?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`July fifth. He had the flu then, you remember.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`But he\u0027s not sick now,\u0027 Graves said, and tugged at his ear. It was a nervous habit he had. And he was very nervous now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were a lot of cops stationed on the road from the airport to the city. Graves commented on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`You haven\u0027t heard?\u0027 Lewis said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Heard what?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`The President\u0027s coming in today.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`No,\u0027 Graves said. `When was that decided? This is only the second day. I\u0027m surprised he\u0027d show before he\u0027s nominated.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Everybody\u0027s surprised. Apparently he intends to address the Convention delegates before the balloting.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Oh?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Yeah.\u0027 Lewis smiled. `It\u0027s also apparently true that there are some squabbles in the rules committee and the platform committee. He\u0027s going to straighten that out.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Ah.\u0027 It was making more sense. The President was a practical politician. He\u0027d sacrifice the drama of a grand entrance if he had to get a political job done earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`We just got the word a couple of hours ago,\u0027 Lewis said. `Same with the police. They\u0027re furious. The Chief has been making statements about how hard it is to provide security...\u0027 He gestured at all the wait- ing cops. They were stationed every thirty yards or so along the road. `I guess he managed.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Looks like it. What time is he due?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Around noon, I think.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey drove on in silence for a while, leaving the coast road and heading into the centre of town. Graves noticed that Broadway had been dressed up, its honkytonk glitter subdued a little. But there were a lot of tough-looking girls around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis commented on it. `The City Fathers are going crazy,\u0027 he said: `About that.\u0027 He jerked his thumb towards one spectacularly constructed girl in a tightly clinging pants suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I thought it wasn\u0027t allowed.\u0027 Traditionally San Diego was free of hookers despite the large sailor population. Tijuana was just twenty minutes away; those services were usually provided across the border.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Nothing they can do about it,\u0027 Lewis said. `Just in the last few hours they\u0027ve all been coming in. Every damned hooker for a thousand miles is here. All the girls from Vegas and Reno and Tahoe. It\u0027s the Convention.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`But the City Fathers don\u0027t like it.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`The City Fathers hate it,\u0027 Lewis said, and grinned. It was a youthful grin, the grin of a person who still found sin amusing, risque, fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves could no longer find the fun in prostitution. Why not? he wondered. Was it age - or was it striking some uncomfortable chord in himself?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he didn\u0027t pursue the thought. Lewis turned left, going up into the hilly section of town towards Wright\u0027s apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHOUR 9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSAN DIEGO\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8 AM PDT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis slowed as they approached a dry cleaning van advertising 24 HOUR SERVICE AT NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE and PLANT ON PREMISES.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`You want to talk to 702?\u0027 Lewis said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Yeah, for a minute,\u0027 Graves said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis pulled over. Graves got out. The driver in the van wound down his window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`I hear you\u0027re rolling it up,\u0027 the driver said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`That\u0027s right,\u0027 Graves said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`When?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Later today.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`What\u0027s proto until then?\u0027 Proto was slang for protocol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Business as usual,\u0027 Graves said. `Where\u0027s 703?F\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Off duty today.\u0027 The driver shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Call them in. I want them to pick up the girl this morning.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Oh?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Yeah.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Anything else?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Yeah. You got some coffee in there?F\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Sure. Two cups?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves looked into the sedan at Lewis. `You want coffee?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Just one,\u0027 Graves said. `Black with four sugars.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver sighed and looked into the interior of the dry cleaning van. `Give the boss his usual,\u0027.he shouted. A moment later a styrofoam cup was passed out to Graves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`You\u0027re going to catch diabetes,\u0027 the driver said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`This is breakfast,\u0027 Graves said, and walked back to his car. In the background he heard the van driver saying, `702 to 703. Over. 702 to 703. Over.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves got in the car, slammed the door. To Lewis: `Let\u0027s go.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`The apartment?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`The apartment.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWright had taken a fashionable apartment in the hilly north-central section of San Diego, not far from the Cortez Hotel. His building looked out over the city and the harbour. At this hour people were leaving the apartment house, standing in front and waiting until the doorman brought their cars around from the underground garage. Graves had had some trouble getting used to that when he first came here. He was accustomed to the East, where people in cities walked to work or took public transportation. In California, everybody drove. Everybody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWright himself was an exception. He had a driver and a limousine. But then, Wright was always an exception, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWright usually came out about 8:20. His girl for the night - one of five or six he saw with some frequency - preceded him by ten or fifteen minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`There she is,\u0027 Lewis said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves nodded. It was odd how you could yell Wright\u0027s irls. Even from across the street they co,zld be spotted instantly. Yet there was no particular physical type, no particular details of dress. They weren\u0027t professionals. But there was a certain quality about them, something blatantly erotic. They were the girls a man would choose if he wanted to be reassured. Graves watched this one, who wore a simple white dress and had very long legs, as she climbed into a Datsun sportscar and drove off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`701 to 703,\u0027 he said, speaking into the intercom mounted on the dash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a crackle of static. `703 here. I thought we could sleep in today.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves ignored the complaint. `Red Datsun sportscar, convertible, California licence ZVW 348. Got it?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Got it. Out.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, a Ford station wagon drove past them, and the driver gave them the high sign briefly. That was 703.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves slumped down in his seat, thinking. They had not bothered to interrogate Wright\u0027s girls in recent weeks. When they began, they had had dozens of interviews with the girls. Sometimes they had been straight interrogations; more often they were casually arranged meetings. In both cases the information was monotonously the same. John Wright was a nice and kind and generous and charming man. He was also nervous and definitely conservative. He sweated a lot, preferred the missionary style, kept the room dark, and always remained a little aloof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHardly valuable intelligence insight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Why do you want this one?\u0027 Lewis asked. And then he said, `Here comes the limo.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA black Lincoln limousine pulled up in front of the apartment building. The chauffeur, George Marks, got out, buttoned his uniform jacket, and stood by the door of the passenger side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves had never picked George up for questioning. It had seemed too risky. Now he wondered if that had been a mistake. But he could think of a hundred possible mistakes he had made, especially today. Especially when Wright was being arrested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Why are they going to arrest Wright?\u0027 Lewis asked. He hadn\u0027t got an answer on his previous question, so he was trying another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves lit a cigarette. `Phelps is nervous.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`But this computer-tapping business isn\u0027t enough -\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Phelps is running scared just now. There\u0027s talk of closing down his division of Intelligence. In fact, the new Secretary is thinking of closing down all State Intelligence work.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis raised his eyebrows. `Where\u0027d you hear that?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves smiled. `I\u0027m in Intelligence myself.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis glanced at him a moment, then looked back out the window. A man emerged from the apartment building - stocky, neatly dressed, moving purposefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`There\u0027s Wright,\u0027 Lewis said and started the engine of his car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraves had watched John Wright get into his limousine every morning for sixty-six days. He knew the routine well: George opened the door and tipped his cap; Wright nodded to him, bent over at the waist, and slipped quickly into the back seat. George closed the door, paused to tug at his leather gloves, and walked around to the driver\u0027s side. In the back seat Wright stared straight ahead or opened his newspaper to read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this time John Wright stared across the street directly at Graves. And he continued to stare until the limousine moved off in the hot San Diego morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis was now very good at following in San Diego traffic; he kept pace - three cars back. After a time Lewis said, `He was looking at you.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`He certainly was.\u0027.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Do you think he\u0027s on to us?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Impossible,\u0027 Graves said. He thought of the closet in his apartment. He had five distinctly different suits in that closet, and he rotated them on different days. He thought of the three sedans and the four delivery trucks that the Department used for surveillance work. Different manufacturers, different colours, and a new licence plate every week. He had never parked in the same place, never waited for Wright in the same way. He had never presented Wright with a recognizable pattern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e`Impossible,\u0027 he said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Graves thought of himself. If he were Wright, would he discover that he was being followed? Even with all the precautions, the safeguards, the changes? He liked to think that he would. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/binary/page-4.html","bookId":2408,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:58 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:58 AM"}
