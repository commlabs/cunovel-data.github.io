Being young he did not follow the sunset so quickly as I did, and the time of rising differs among blood drinkers even when age is not a question at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat in the gold-lined chamber, deep in my thoughts about the scholar named Raymond Gallant, and wondered if he had left Venice as I had advised him to do. What danger could he bring to me, I thought, even if he meant to do it, for whom would he Incite against me and on what charge?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was far too strong to be overcome or imprisoned. Such a thing was preposterous. The very worst that could happen was that if this man marked me as some sort of dangerous alchemist, or even a demon, I should have to take Amadeo and go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I did not like these thoughts, and so I chose during these quiet moments to believe in Raymond Gallant, to be fond of him and to trust in him, and to let my mind search the city around me to see if I might find a trace of his presence, which would displease me in the extreme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had only started this search when something utterly ghastly blotted put my reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard screams coming from my own house. And I heard the cry of blood drinkers! I heard the cry of Satan worshipers\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;the chant of condemnations\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;and in my mind\u0027s eye I saw my rooms filled with spreading fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI beheld Bianca\u0027s face in the minds of others. I heard the cries of my boys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuickly I threw off the cover of Amadeo\u0027s coffin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come, Amadeo, I need you,\" I cried in this frantic, foolish moment. \"They\u0027re burning the house. Bianca is in danger. Come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is it, Master,\" he said, flying up the steps beside me. \"Is it Those Who Must Be Kept?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Amadeo,\" I said, taking him under my arm and flying to the roof of the palazzo, \"It\u0027s a band of demon-worshiping blood drinkers. They\u0027re weak. They will burn by their own torches! We must save Bianca. We must save the boys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I reached the house, I realized that they were attacking it in unimaginable numbers. Santino had realized his crazed dreams. In every room there was a zealous assailant putting to the torch whatever he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire house was filled with fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I rushed to the top of the main stairs I saw Bianca far below me, surrounded by the black-cloaked demons, who tormented her with torches as she screamed. Vincenzo lay dead before the open front doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear the shouts of the gondoliers pleading with those inside to come out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dropped to the bottom of the stairway, and with the Fire Gift burnt Bianca\u0027s young and blundering attackers, who all but tripped on their black robes as they went up in flames. Some I could only force away with physical blows because I had no time to direct my powerful gifts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuickly I carried Bianca through the thick smoke and out onto the quais. I heaved her into the arms of a boatman who at once moved to take her away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I turned back to save the screaming boys, a host of black-clad monsters surrounded me and again I burnt them with the Fire Gift, battering at their torches clumsily as I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house was everywhere in chaos. Statues fell over the railings. Tapestries were set ablaze and paintings smoldered, but the boys, what could I do to protect the boys?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I burnt one ring of monsters there came another, and from all sides the condemnations:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heretic, blasphemer, Marius, the idolater, Marius, the pagan. Santino condemns you to burn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain and again I knocked the torches aside. Again and again I burnt the intruders. Again and again I heard their dying cries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smoke blinded me as it might have a mortal. The boys were roaring in panic as they were carried out of the house and over the rooftops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amadeo!\" I called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom above, I heard him desperately call to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ascended, yet at every landing they accosted me and I found myself whipping around and playing the same game of force and Fire Gift as rapidly as I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amadeo, use your strength,\" I called out to him. I could not see him. \"Use the gifts I\u0027ve given you.\" I could only hear his cries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set ablaze those who crowded close to me. I could see nothing but the creatures burning, and then more torches thrust towards me as I hurled them back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to burn!\" I declared, seeking to threaten them but no lesson of power stopped them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn their fervor they came on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Santino sends you his holy fire. Santino sends you his justice. Santino claims your pupils. Santino claims your fledglings. Now it is time for you to burn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAH of a sudden and indeed, it was all of sudden\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;there did come the fatal circle of some seven or eight of them swift enough to plunge the fire at me so that it caught all of my garments and my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst my body itself this fire burnt, swallowing my head and all of my limbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor one slight moment I thought I shall survive this, this is nothing, I am Marius, the Immortal One, and then there came to me in a fury the horrid memory of the blood of the Elder in Egypt set afire by a lamp, burning with lurid smoke on the floor of my room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere came a memory of the blood of Euxodia in Constantinople, bursting into flame on the floor of the shrine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere came the memory of the Druid god in the grove with his black burnt skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I knew in the next instant, without memory or thought, that my blood had been fatally ignited\u0026amp;iexcl;\u0026amp;ordf;that no matter how strong my skin or my bone, or my will, I was now burning, burning with such pain and such speed that nothing could keep me from being destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marius,\" Amadeo cried out in terror. \"Marius.\" I heard his voice like a bell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cannot say reason drove me in any direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did know I had reached the rooftop, and the cries of Amadeo and the boys were moving far off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marius,\" cried Amadeo one more time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was blind to all who still tormented me. I was blind to the sky. In my ears, I heard the old God of the Grove on the night of my making telling me that I was immortal, that I could only be destroyed by the sun or by fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor life, I reached with all my remaining power. And in this state, I willed myself to reach the proper railing of the roof garden and to plummet down into the canal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, down, down, into the water, under the water,\" I said aloud, forcing myself to hear the words, and then through the fetid waters I swam as fast as I could, clinging to the bottom, cooled and soothed and saved by the filthy water, leaving behind the burning palazzo from which my children had been stolen, in which my paintings had been destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour, perhaps longer, I remained in the canal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fire in my veins had been quenched almost immediately, but the raw pain was almost unendurable, and when at last I rose it was to seek that gold-lined chamber where my coffin lay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was unable to walk to this room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFearfully, on hands and knees, I sought the back entrance of the house, and managed by means of both the Mind Gift and my fingers to unlatch the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen moving slowly through the many chambers I came at last to the heavy barrier which I had made to my tomb. For how long I struggled with it I do not know, only that it was the Mind Gift which finally unfastened it, not the strength of my burnt hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last I crept down the stairs to the dark quiet of the golden room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed a miracle when at last I lay beside my coffin. I was too exhausted to move further, and with every breath I felt pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sight of my burnt arms and legs was stultifying. And when I reached to feel my hair, I realized that most of it was gone. I felt my ribs beneath the thickened black flesh of my chest. I needed no mirror to tell me that I had become a horror, that my face was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what grieved me far worse was that when I leant against my coffin and listened, I could hear the boys wailing, wailing as a ship took them to some distant port, and I could hear Amadeo pleading with his captors for some kind of reason. But no reason came. Only the chants of the Satan worshipers were sung to my poor children. And I knew these Satan worshipers were taking my children South to Rome, South to Santino, whom I had foolishly condemned and dismissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmadeo was once more a prisoner, once more a captive of those who would use him for their evil ends. Amadeo had once more been stolen from a way of life to be taken to another inexplicable place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, how I hated myself that I had not destroyed Santino! Why had I ever suffered him to live!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd even now, as I tell you this story, I despise him! Oh, how heartily and eternally I despise him because he destroyed, in the name of Satan, all that I held precious, because he took my Amadeo away from me, because he took those whom I protected, because he burnt the palazzo which contained the fruits of my dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I repeat myself, don\u0027t I? You must forgive me. Surely you must understand the pure arrogance and utter cruelty of what Santino did to me. Surely you must understand the pure destructive force with which he changed the course of Amadeo\u0027s journey....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I knew that this journey would be changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew it as I lay against the side of my coffin. I knew it because I was too weak to recover my pupil, too weak to save the wretched mortal boys who would suffer some unspeakable cruelties, too weak even to hunt for myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if I could not hunt, how would I gain the blood to heal?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lay back on the floor of the room and I tried to quell the pain in my burnt flesh. I tried only to think and to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could hear Bianca. Bianca had survived, Bianca was alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, Bianca had brought others to save our house, but it was far beyond saving. And once again, as in war and pillage, I had lost the beautiful things I cherished; I had lost my books; I had lost my writings, such as they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow many hours I lay there I don\u0027t know, but when I rose to take the lid from my coffin I found that I still could not stand. Indeed, I could not remove the lid with my burnt arms. Only with the Mind Gift could I push it and then not very fan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI settled back down on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was too full of pain to move again for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould I hope to travel over the miles to reach the Divine Parents? I didn\u0027t know. And I couldn\u0027t risk leaving this chamber to find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevertheless I pictured Those Who Must Be Kept. I prayed to them. Deeply, vividly I envisioned Akasha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help me, my Queen,\" I whispered aloud. \"Help me. Guide me. Remember when you spoke to me in Egypt. Remember. Speak to me now. I have never suffered before as I am suffering now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then an old taunt came back to me, a taunt as old as prayers themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who will tend your shrine if I am not restored?\" I demanded. I trembled in my misery. \"Beloved Akasha,\" I whispered. \"Who will worship you if I am destroyed? Help me, guide me, for some night in these passing centuries you may have need of me! Who has cared for you for so long!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what good is it ever to taunt the gods and the goddesses?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sent out the Mind Gift with all its strength to the snowy Alps in which I had built and concealed the chapel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My Queen, tell me how I may come to you? Could something as dreadful as this draw you from your solitude, or do I ask too much? I dream of miracles but I cannot imagine them. I pray for mercy, yet I cannot envision how it would come about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew it was vain, if not blasphemy, to beg her to rise from her throne for me. But was she so powerful that she could give some miraculous strength over the miles?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How will I return to you?\" I prayed. \"How will I ever fulfill again my duties if I am not healed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence of the golden room answered. It was as cold as the shrine in the mountains. I imagined I could feel the snow of the Alps on my burnt flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut slowly the horror sunk in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I gave a soft, sad little laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t reach you,\" I said, \"not without assistance, and how can I obtain that assistance unless I forsake the secret of what I am? Unless I forsake the secret of the Chapel of Those Who Must Be Kept?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last I climbed to my knees and struggled up the stone stairs very slowly; and painfully, I managed to stand, and with the Mind Gift, fasten the bronze door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSafety, that was important, very important. I must survive this, I thought. I must not despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen collapsing again and crawling down the stairs to the golden chamber, in the manner of something loathsome and lurid, I pushed doggedly against the lid of my coffin until it was open sufficiently for me to go to my rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever had I known such injury, never had I known such pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA monstrous humiliation was mingled with the torture. Oh, there was so much I had not known about existence, so much I had not understood about life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoon the cries of the boys were gone from my ears, no matter how keenly I listened. The boat had carried them over the waters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I could still hear Bianca.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBianca wept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn misery and pain, my mind searched Venice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Raymond Gallant, member of the Talamasca,\" I whispered, \"I need you now. Raymond Gallant, pray you haven\u0027t left Venice. Raymond\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGallant of the Talamasca, please hear my prayers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could find no trace of him, but who knew what had happened to my powers? Perhaps all had dwindled. I could not even remember clearly his room or where it had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut why did I hope to find him? Had I not told him to leave the Veneto? Had I not impressed upon him that he must leave? Of course he had done as I had told him to do. No doubt he was miles beyond the point where he might hear my call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNevertheless I continued to say his name over and over as if it were a prayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Raymond Gallant of the Talamasca, I need you. I need you now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the approaching dawn brought a frigid relief to me. The roaring pain subsided slowly and my dreams began as they will do if I sleep before the rise of the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my dreams, I saw Bianca. She had her servants about her, and they comforted her, and she said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are dead, both of them, I know it. They have died in the fire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027\u0027No, my sweet one,\" I said. With all the power of the Mind Gift I called to her:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBianca, Amadeo is gone, but I live. Do not fear me when you set eyes upon me, for I am badly burnt. But I live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the eyes of the others, I saw a mirror of her as she stopped and turned away from them. I saw her rise from her chair and move towards the window. I saw her open it and peer out into the dampness at the approaching light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight, when the sun sets, I will call to you. Bianca. I am a monster now in my own eyes and will be a monster in yours. But I will endure this suffering. I will call to you. Don\u0027t be afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marius,\" she said. The mortals who gathered around her heard her speak my name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the sleep of the morning had come over me. I couldn\u0027t resist it. The pain was at last gone. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-and-gold-the-vampire-chronicles-8/page-24.html","bookId":2594,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:22:49 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:22:49 PM"}
