I appreciated the effort, especially after hearing the story of how your mom and you made them when you were little—with “chocolate chips” and yellow fruits called “bananas.” I hope to see and taste a banana one day. I choose to believe that they still exist in tube city, where all sorts of things exist—things that I have only dreamed about, like stores and restaurants and dogs and cats and movie theaters and sky walks and so many other nouns we’ve seen on the visualizer beam whenever the signal is strong enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd your birthday present to me was also… beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you said we were going to use the last two oxygen tanks, I didn’t want to do it, because it meant that you’d never be able to go scuba diving again, unless the North American Land Collective sends you more bottles, which isn’t likely to happen, now that they’ve declared world order and Outpost 37, Lighthouse 1 is no longer technically operational.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I’m glad that I went scuba diving with you down into “Philadelphia” one last time with old Horatio the dolphin following.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t believe you when you said there was a red statue that read: “LOVE,” with the LO stacked on top of the VE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLOVE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sounded like something out of one of the old fairy tales you used to tell me when I was a little girl. I thought you were kidding when you said people in the past believed in love so much that they made statues to celebrate it, so they wouldn’t forget to LOVE… well, that seemed kind of ridiculous—but when we dove down and you shined the thermal lantern, and it turned out to be true, I felt like there were so many possibilities in the world—like I’m only beginning to discover what’s achievable. Maybe I will find a pure love—like what you and Mom have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom told me that you and Horatio searched for the statue for weeks and then cleaned all the seaweed off, using up most of your oxygen supply, and so I wanted to say it was the best birthday present I have ever received.
