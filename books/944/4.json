{"id":41754,"no":4,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"\u0026nbsp;\"B—but why do these things have to be so secret?\" Ronnie asked. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Because of competitors, in the case of corporations—or because of enemy nations in the case of government work. The written material you might have access to could describe secret weapons and new processes or plans for next year\u0027s advertising—maybe even a scheme for, er, liquidation of a rival. If all facts and policies were made public, there might be criticism, controversy, opposition by certain groups. The less people know about things, the better. So we have to keep all these things secret.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ronnie scowled. \"But if things are written down, someone has to read them, don\u0027t they?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Sure, son. One person in ten thousand might reach the point where his corporation or bureau will teach him to read. But you prove your ability and loyalty first. By the time you\u0027re 35 or 40, they might want you to learn to read. But for young people and children—well, it just isn\u0027t done. Why, the President himself wasn\u0027t trusted to learn till he was nearly fifty!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dad straightened his shoulders. \"Look at me. I\u0027m only 30, but I\u0027ve been a messenger for Secret material already. In a few years, if things go well, I should be handling Top-Secret stuff. And who knows? Maybe by the time I\u0027m 50 I\u0027ll be giving orders instead of carrying them. Then I\u0027ll learn to read, too. That\u0027s the right way to do it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ronnie shifted uncomfortably on the hassock. \"But can\u0027t a Reader get a job that\u0027s not so important. Like a barber or a plumber or—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Don\u0027t you understand? The barber and plumbing equipment corporations set up their stores and hire men to work for them. You think they\u0027d hire a Reader? People\u0027d say you were a spy or a subversive or that you\u0027re crazy like old man Davis.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Mr. Davis isn\u0027t crazy. And he isn\u0027t old. He\u0027s young, just like you, and—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Ronnie!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dad\u0027s voice was knife-sharp and December-cold. Ronnie slipped off the hassock as if struck physically by the fury of the voice. He sat sprawled on his small posterior, fresh fear etched on his thin features.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Damn it, son, how could you even think of being a Reader? You\u0027ve got a life-sized, 3-D video here, and we put on the smell and touch and heat attachments just for you. You can listen to any tape in the world at school. Ronnie, don\u0027t you realize I\u0027d lose my job if people knew I had a Reader for a son?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"B—but, Daddy—\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dad jumped to his feet. \"I hate to say it, Edith, but we\u0027ve got to put this boy in a reformatory. Maybe a good memory-wash will take some of the nonsense out of him!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3100/85425.html","bookId":944,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 5:30:17 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 5:30:17 AM"}
