I was the only one – Olga and Tiger Cub approved of what the boss was up to, and if I asked the others, they\u0027d all feel the same way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I really wasn\u0027t being objective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a sip of cognac and then looked into the Twilight, trying to locate the pale lights of unintelligent life in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were mosquitoes, two flies and one spider, right up in a corner of the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuffled my fingers and made a tiny fireball, two millimetres across. I took aim at the spider – a fixed target is best for practising on – and sent the fireball on its way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing immoral about my behaviour. We\u0027re not Buddhists, at least most of the Others in Russia aren\u0027t. We eat meat, we kill flies and mosquitoes, we poison cockroaches: if you\u0027re too lazy to learn new frightening spells every month, the insects quickly develop immunity to your magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing immoral. It was just funny, it was the proverbial \u0027using a fireball to kill a mosquito\u0027. A favourite game with children when they\u0027re studying for the Watch. I think the Dark Ones probably do the same, except that they don\u0027t distinguish between a fly and a sparrow, a mosquito and a dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fried the spider with my first shot. And the drowsy mosquitoes were no problem either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI celebrated each victory with a glass of cognac, clinking it against the obliging bottle. Then I started trying to kill the flies, but either I\u0027d already had too much to drink or the flies were much better at sensing the little ball of fire approaching. I wasted four shots on the first one, but even though I missed at least I managed to disperse the first three in time. I got the second fly with my sixth shot, and in the process I managed to zap two balls of lightning into the glass of the cabinet standing against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Sorry about that,\u0027 I said repentantly, downing my cognac. I got up and the room suddenly swayed. I went over to the cabinet, which contained swords hanging on a background of black velvet. At first glance I thought they looked German, fifteenth or sixteenth century. The cabinet light was switched off, and I didn\u0027t try to determine their age more precisely. There were little craters in the glass, but at least I hadn\u0027t hit the swords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought for a while about how to put things right and couldn\u0027t come up with anything better than putting the glass that had been scattered round the room back where it had come from. It cost me more effort than if I\u0027d dematerialised all the glass and then recreated it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that I went into the bar. I didn\u0027t feel like any more cognac, but a bottle of Mexican coffee liqueur looked like a good compromise between the desire to get drunk and the desire to perk myself up. Coffee and alcohol, all in the same bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I turned back round I saw Semyon sitting in my chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027They\u0027ve all gone to the lake,\u0027 the magician told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ll be right there,\u0027 I promised, walking towards him. \u0027Right there.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Put the bottle down,\u0027 Semyon advised me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What for?\u0027 I asked. But I put it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked hard into my eyes. My barriers didn\u0027t go up, and when I realised it was a trick it was too late. I tried to look away, but I couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You bastard!\u0027 I gasped, doubling over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Down the corridor on the right!\u0027 Semyon shouted after me. His eyes were still boring into my back, the invisible connecting thread was still trailing after me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached the bathroom. Five minutes later my tormentor caught up with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Feeling better?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes,\u0027 I said, breathing heavily. I got up off my knees and stuck my head into the basin. Semyon opened the tap without saying anything and slapped me on the back:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Relax. We started with basic folk remedies, but now . . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wave of heat ran through my body. I groaned, but I didn\u0027t complain any more. The dull stupefaction was already long gone and now the final toxins came flying out of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What are you doing?\u0027 I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Helping your liver out. Have some water and you\u0027ll feel better.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt helped all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive minutes later I walked out of the bathroom, sweaty and wet, but utterly sober. I even tried to protest at the violation of my rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What did you interfere for? I wanted to get drunk and I did.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You young people,\u0027 said Semyon, shaking his head reproachfully. \u0027He wanted to get drunk? Who gets drunk on cognac? Especially after wine. And especially that quick, half a litre in half an hour. There was this time Sasha Kuprin and I decided to get drunk—\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Which Sasha\u0027s that?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You know the one, the writer. Only he wasn\u0027t a writer then. We got drunk the right way, the civilised way, totally smashed, dancing on the tables, shooting at the ceiling.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Was he an Other, then?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Sasha? No, but he was a good man. We drank a quarter of a bucket of vodka and we got the grammar-school girls drunk on champagne.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slumped down on to the sofa. I looked at the empty bottle and gulped, starting to feel sick again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027A quarter of a bucket, you must have got really drunk.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Of course we did!\u0027 Semyon said. \u0027It\u0027s okay to get drunk, Anton. If you really need to. Only you have to get drunk on vodka. Cognac and wine – that\u0027s all for the heart.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027So what\u0027s vodka for?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027For the soul. If it\u0027s hurting real bad.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me with gentle reproach, a funny little magician with a cunning face, with his own funny little memories about great people and great battles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I was wrong,\u0027 I admitted. \u0027Thanks for your help.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No problem, my man. I once sobered up another Anton three times in the same evening. When he needed to drink without getting drunk, it was work.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Another Anton? Chekhov?\u0027 I asked in astonishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No, don\u0027t be stupid. It was another Anton, one of us. He was killed in the Far East, when the samurai . . .\u0027 Semyon flipped his hand through the air and stopped. Then he said almost affectionately \u0027Don\u0027t be in such a hurry. We\u0027ll do things the civilised way this evening. Right now we\u0027ve got to catch up with the others. Let\u0027s go.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI meekly followed Semyon out of the house. And I saw Sveta. She was sitting on a lounger, already wearing her swimsuit and a bright skirt, or rather, a strip of cloth round her hips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Are you okay?\u0027 she asked, looking at me in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Sure. The kebabs just didn\u0027t agree with me.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvetlana looked hard at me. But apparently the dark flush on my face and my wet hair were the only signs I\u0027d got drunk so quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You should have your pancreas checked out.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Everything\u0027s okay,\u0027 Semyon interrupted. \u0027Believe me, I studied healing too. It was the heat, the sour wine, the fatty kebabs – nothing more to it. What he needs now is a swim, and in the cool of the evening we\u0027ll polish off a bottle together. That\u0027s all the treatment he needs.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSveta got up, walked up to me and looked into my eyes sympathetically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Maybe we should just sit here for a while. I\u0027ll make some strong tea.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, probably. It would be good. Just to sit here. The two of us. And drink tea. Talk or not say a word. That didn\u0027t matter. Look at her sometimes or not even look. Just hear her breathing – or stop up my ears. Simply know that we\u0027re together. Just the two of us, and not the entire Night Watch. Together because we want to be, not because of some plan hatched by Gesar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad I really forgotten how to smile?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, twisting my stubborn face into a cowardly smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Let\u0027s go. I\u0027m not a doddery old veteran of the magic wars yet. Let\u0027s go, Sveta.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSemyon had already gone on ahead, but somehow I could tell that he winked. Approvingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night didn\u0027t bring any real coolness, but at least it took the edge off the heat. From about six or seven in the evening the company split up into groups. The indefatigable Ignat stayed down by the lake with Lena and, strangely enough, Olga. Tiger Cub and Yulia went off to wander in the forest. The others were scattered through the house and around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSemyon and I occupied the large loggia on the second floor. It was cosy in there, it let the wind through better and it had wicker furniture – perfect for hot weather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Number one,\u0027 said Semyon, taking a bottle of Smirnovskaya vodka out of a plastic bag with an advert for Danone kids\u0027 yoghurt on the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Is that good?\u0027 I asked doubtfully. I don\u0027t regard myself as a vodka expert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ve been drinking it for more than a hundred years. And it used to be far worse than it is now, believe me.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bottle was followed out of the bag by two plain glasses, a two-litre jar with pickles floating in brine under its flat tin lid and a large cellophane bag of sauerkraut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What about something to drink with it?\u0027 I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You don\u0027t drink anything else with vodka, my boy,\u0027 said Semyon, shaking his head. \u0027Only with the fake stuff.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There\u0027s always something new to learn.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027ll learn this lesson soon enough. And there\u0027s no need to worry about the vodka, Chernogolovka village is in the territory I patrol. I know this wizard who works in the distillery there, small fry, not particularly nasty. He gets me the right stuff.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027An exchange of petty favours,\u0027 I commented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No exchange. I pay him money, all honest and above board. It\u0027s our private business, nothing to do with the Watches.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSemyon deftly twisted the cap off the bottle and poured us half a glass each. His bag had been standing on the veranda all day, but the vodka was still cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027To good health?\u0027 I suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Too soon for that. To us.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he\u0027d sobered me up that afternoon, he must have done a thorough job and not just removed the alcohol from my bloodstream, but all the metabolic side-products as well. I drank the half-glass without even shuddering, and was amazed to discover that vodka could taste good after the heat of a summer day, not only after a winter frost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well now,\u0027 said Semyon with a grunt of satisfaction, settling down more comfortably. \u0027We should drop a hint to Tiger Cub that a pair of rocking chairs would be good up here.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took out his appalling Yavas and lit up. When he spotted the annoyance on my face he said:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m going to carry on smoking them anyway. I\u0027m a patriot, I love my country.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m a patriot too, I love my health,\u0027 I retorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSemyon chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There was one time this foreigner I knew invited me to go round to his place,\u0027 he began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027A long time ago?\u0027 I asked, playing along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Not really, last year. He invited me round so I could teach him how to drink Russian-style. He was staying in the Penta hotel. So I picked up a girlfriend of mine and her brother – he was just back from prison camp, with nowhere to go – and off we went.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI imagined what the group must have looked like and shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027And they let you in?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You used magic?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No, my foreign friend used money. He\u0027d laid in plenty of vodka and snacks, we started drinking on the thirtieth of April and finished on the second of May. We didn\u0027t let the maids in and we never turned the television off.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-57.html","bookId":2623,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM"}
