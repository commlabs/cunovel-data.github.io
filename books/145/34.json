Indeed, she will, I make no doubt, rejoice in having found such a friend and protector for her child.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [173]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Your lordship’s good opinion is truly flattering!” replied Edmund, “and I hope, when the well being, and I may, perhaps, say happiness through life, of a young and innocent being, are committed to my keeping, I may not undertake the charge, with light or careless ideas of its responsibility.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So, as Frances would say, they really are going to be married!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “With your principles, Captain Montgomery, there can be little doubt of your fulfilling well any duties you take upon yourself. If the boy is tolerably well disposed, he has every chance, in such hands, of turning out an honour to his profession: though it can fall to the lot of but few to adorn it quite as brilliantly as Captain Montgomery has done!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lord Arandale is speaking of young Oswald, Sir Archibald’s boy; and the letter which he[174] has just finished folding, he is, we perceive, now directing to Lady Oswald, the boy’s mother. In fact, Edmund had applied to his lordship the night before, for the purpose of having it thus arranged. He felt a delicacy, as a total stranger, in obtruding his offers of service on Lady Oswald, and had requested Lord Arandale to take, (on the plea of his long friendship for Sir Archibald,) nominally, the lead in the business, by addressing a letter to her ladyship, saying, that he had now an opportunity of placing her son in the Euphrasia frigate, commanded by Captain Montgomery; and stating that the attending circumstances were particularly favourable, as young Oswald would thus have an opportunity of forming a desirable intimacy with his cousin, Lord Ormond, who was the particular friend of Captain Montgomery; and of becoming[175] personally known to Lord Fitz-Ullin, who, it could not be doubted, would take an interest in the advancement of so near a connexion, when thus placed within the sphere of his observation. On the strength of a lady not understanding those matters, the gentlemen ventured to enclose a bank bill for a moderate sum, as advance of pay to Mr. Oswald for his fitting out.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/795/59018.html","bookId":145,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 5:15:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 5:15:11 AM"}
