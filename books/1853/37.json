You probably thought I was a complete ass**le.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smirked at me. \"I did. At first. Liz wanted to kick your ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think she still does,\" I deadpanned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled and it made my knees weak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honestly, I didn’t know what to think when I first saw you and you didn’t say anything. I figured you were just a typical ass**le that had countless one-night-stands in college. But after some of the stuff Jim told us you said, Liz figured out pretty quickly that you must have just been too drunk that night to remember everything about me. I’m still going with the idea that I just wasn\u0027t very memorable to begin with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed at her own words but I could tell that idea bothered her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t even joke about that. Do you have any idea how long I\u0027ve looked for you? How bat shit crazy Drew thinks I am because I keep trying to find lotion that smells like chocolate and nothing ever comes close to the way I remembered you? I was beginning to think I imagined you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled her body back against mine and rested my forehead against hers, afraid to let go of her for fear she would disappear again. How could this be real? Drew is never going to believe this. Fuck, I still didn\u0027t believe it. Now that she was this close, I could smell her skin without even trying and it made me smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You either didn\u0027t have as much to drink that night as I did or you just have a damn good memory. How in the hell did you recognize me?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire opened her mouth to speak, but right then, the door to the store burst open and she pulled back out of my arms suddenly as we both turned in that direction. The little boy with the mouth flew through the door and I let out a laugh, figuring he had gotten away from his dad again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mommy! I gots ice cream!\" he yelled as he ran towards us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood there with my mouth open as Claire bent down and caught the little guy as he threw himself into her arms. She looked up at me in complete and utter horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly shit. She has a kid. I\u0027ve been looking for her for five years and she went off and had a kid. Well doesn\u0027t this sunk donkey dick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweetie, that kid is about two steps away from getting one of those kid leash things they sell at the store. Or a shock collar. I wonder if you need a concealed carry permit to get a taser.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn walked the dad I saw earlier, and I tried not to cringe as he walked over to where Claire was crouched down still hugging the boy and looking a little bit like she might puke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire has an old man fetish. This guy has to be pushing fifty. I’d puke too if I was here. That\u0027s kind of gross. She\u0027s touched those old, wrinkly balls. When he cums I bet it\u0027s just a puff of smoke poofing out of his elderly penis. The guy finally glanced over at me, looking me up and down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\" he asked, obviously forgetting our encounter just moments ago due to the Alzheimer’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have old balls,\" I mumbled angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"George! I thought I saw your car pull up a little bit ago!\" Liz exclaimed as she walked over from her side of the store and right up to Claire, helping her off the floor. I stared at the back of the guy\u0027s head as Liz walked over and he turned to give her a hug. He\u0027s got thinning hair for f**k\u0027s sake. Can his balls even grow hair anymore? I want to punch his hairless old balls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire looked nervously back and forth between Old Man Winter and me. I wonder what he would think about the fact that Claire and I had a past. And that she almost made out with me right before he got here and interrupted us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I slept with your wife,\" I stated, crossing my arms in front of me and staring him down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll three of them gaped at me with equal looks of confusion on their faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You swept wif my Nana? Did she read you a bedtime story? Papa says she snores.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeorge took a step towards me and I actually gulped. Regardless of how old his balls were, I was sure he could kick my ass. Or kill me and make it look like an accident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad,\" Claire said in warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad? Oh, f**k. I really am an ass**le. I have Tourette\u0027s of the mouth. Claire never once mentioned his name when she talked about him. This was the man who punched someone in the face for calling him grandpa. And now I just told him he had old balls. He was going to straight up murder me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit. I didn\u0027t sleep with your wife. Total mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped walking towards me and if I had a brain I would have kept my mouth shut from that point on. Obviously I was drunk the day they were handing those things out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got confused. I meant to say I slept with your daughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard Liz groan and saw Claire\u0027s mouth fall open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s not what you think,\" I continued quickly. \"I mean, we were both really, really drunk and I didn\u0027t even know who she was until a minute ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh my God, stop. STOP!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of his eyebrows cocked and I swear I heard him crack his knuckles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She smells like chocolate and I don\u0027t like to be spanked,\" I blurted in a panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus Christ...\" George muttered, shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw Claire smack Liz from behind George. Liz was snorting with laughter. Of course she found this funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like to be spanked either. How\u0027s come I don\u0027t have hair on my balls? Mommy, you aren\u0027t going to spank him are you?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduction-and-snacks-chocolate-lovers-1/page-37.html","bookId":1853,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:17:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:17:54 PM"}
