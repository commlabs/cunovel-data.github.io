If we die, then Preacher Jack proves to the crowd that we’re sinners. If we make it out and they let us go, Preacher Jack and White Bear prove that their word is good. Either way they win.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNix chewed her lip. He stepped closer and touched her cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey … are you okay? No, wait—that is the stupidest question ever asked. What I mean is—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNix blinked and smiled, and for a moment she was back. The old Nix. Strong and smart and sane. She grabbed Benny and gave him a fierce hug, and in a tiny whisper filled with enormous emotion said, “I don’t want to die down here, Benny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey!” yelled White Bear. “When you two lovebirds are done making out, can we get a move on? Lot of people paid good money for this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny and Nix made the same obscene gesture at exactly the same moment. White Bear laughed out loud, and the audience applauded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Benny released Nix he whispered, “We can do this. Find the bell, get out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Warrior smart,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Warrior smart,” he agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey!” yelled Nix. “Aren’t we supposed to have weapons or something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreacher Jack leaned out over the edge. “The Children of Lazarus carry no weapons, and yet they strike with the power of the righteous. How would it be fair to arm you against them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” said Benny, “then are we going to face two zom—I mean two Children—who are the same size and weight and age as us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smile on Preacher Jack’s face was truly vile. It was filled with everything polluted and corrupt and unnatural that could show through smiling lips and twinkling blue eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Prayer and true repentance are your true weapons,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped back, and other faces began filling the edge of the pit. Torches were placed in stands mounted on the rim, and their light turned the maze into a dim eternity of dirty yellow shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNix suddenly grabbed Benny’s arm, and he turned to see that the shadows were not empty. Things moved down the twisted tunnels. Stiff figures shuffled toward them through the gloom, and then they heard the low, hungry moan of the living dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e73\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHONG STOOD IN THE SHADOWS AND WATCHED TOM IMURA WALK UP onto the hotel porch. There were two guards there, both of them armed with shotguns. They stiffened as Tom mounted the steps. One guard gestured for him to stop on the top step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you’re here for the games,” he began, “you need to go around—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose were his last words. Chong never saw Tom’s hand move. All he saw was a flash of bright steel that seemed to whip one way and then the other, and suddenly both men were falling away from Tom. Blood painted the wall and door of the old hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the fastest thing Chong had ever witnessed, and on a deep gut level he knew that it was necessary, but it was also wrong. These men were part of Gameland, they were forcing kids to fight in zombie pits, and yet their lives had ended in the blink of an eye. They were discarded. Tom used chiburi—a kenjutsu wrist-flick technique that whipped all the blood off his sword blade. The sword gleamed as if it had not just been used to take two human lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom turned as Chong crept up the porch steps. He looked sad. “Sorry you had to see this, Chong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me too,” said Chong sadly. “Guess we had no choice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not if we want to save Benny and Nix.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is war,” said Chong. “And these people are monsters.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom put his hand on Chong’s uninjured shoulder. “Listen to me. There are good people too. No matter how bad this gets, kiddo, never forget that. There are more good people than bad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChong said nothing. He absently touched the bite on his other shoulder. “Aren’t you going to quiet them?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. We need all the help we can get. Let them wander around and confuse things. I’ll take care of them later if there’s time. Right now we have to find Benny, Nix, and Lilah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChong said, “I hope she’s okay.” He was aware that he’d said “she” rather than “them,” but Tom didn’t seem to mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry things didn’t work out with you two,” Tom said. “For what’s it worth … she couldn’t do any better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChong didn’t reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom quietly opened the front door and stepped inside. And stopped dead. His eyes went wide, and when Chong followed him in, he also stared. On one side of the room, weapons, ammunition, and explosives were stacked from floor to ceiling; on the other were hundreds of smaller, more well-used guns and rifles, each of them hanging on a nail driven into the wall. Small paper tags hung from each trigger guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is all this?” asked Chong in a hushed voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom listened for sounds of other people, heard nothing. Then he touched the barrel of one of the new rifles. “Probably scavenged a military base.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChong pointed to the older weapons. “And these?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They probably collect firearms from everyone who comes to Gameland. They did that before. Keeps people from shooting each other over bets.” He bent and read several of the small tags. “Damn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom held out one of the pistols. “Read the tag.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lucille Flax.” Chong looked up, confused. “I don’t understand. Mrs. Flax is my—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“—math teacher. I know. There’s a shotgun here with Adrian Flax’s name on it. That’s her husband.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait,” said Chong, “are you trying to say that they’re here? That my math teacher and her husband come to Gameland?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How else would you read it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t make sense! They’re regular people… . Mrs. Flax doesn’t come to places like this. She can’t!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not? Chong … no matter how often you see someone, you can’t ever say that you really know them. Everyone has secrets, everyone has parts of themselves that they hide from the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But … Mrs. Flax? She’s so … ordinary.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, kiddo, it’s not like people walk around with signs saying, ‘Hey, I’m actually a creep!’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChong kept shaking his head. “And I was running home to people like that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Remember what I said. There are more good people than bad. Even so … you always have to pay attention.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChong sighed. “I guess this shouldn’t hit me so hard. After all Benny, Morgie, and I used to hang around Charlie and the Hammer all the time. We thought they were—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“—cool. Yep, I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Still. My math teacher? Jeez … so much for civilized behavior.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Walls, towns, rules, and day-to-day life doesn’t make us civilized, Chong. That’s organization and ritual. Civilization lives in our hearts and heads or it doesn’t exist at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Chong spotted something that made him yelp. He ran across the room to a big urn in which long-handled weapons stood like a bouquet of militant flowers. He slid two items from the urn: a pair of wooden swords.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom took the bokkens from him. “Son of a—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both froze as they heard a sound from somewhere else in the hotel. A sharp cry. A child’s yelp of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom turned and looked at the broad staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not Benny or Nix. Too young,” gasped Chong in a horrified voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know,” Tom said bitterly, and headed up the stairs. “Stay behind me and let me handle things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey moved up the stairs as quickly as they could, but the building was old and the stairs creaked. Luckily, the laughter from outside was so loud that most of the noise was hidden. However, when they were near the top step, one board creaked louder than all the others. The hallway was empty and poorly lit by lanterns set on shelves along the walls, with doors leading to rooms on both sides. One door stood ajar, and from that there was a sharp call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be right back,” said a man as he stepped into the hall. Chong estimated that he was at least twenty feet from where Tom crouched on the top step. It seemed like a mile. The man looked up and down the hall and was starting to turn back to the room when he saw the figures crouched in the shadows of the stairway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” he said, his voice rising an octave in alarm. It was the last thing he said. Tom surged forward, racing at full speed toward the man. His rush was so sudden that the twenty feet melted into nothing. Steel flashed and red sprayed and then the man was falling. Without a second’s pause, Tom kicked open the door and leaped into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChong was running now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were screams and the rasp of knives being drawn, then a single muffled gunshot. The bullet punched through the plaster wall a foot behind Chong, making him jump. He crouched low and peered inside the room. The sight was one that he knew he would never forget.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a big room, a suite. Along the far wall was an old iron radiator, and through its metal structure the guards had run three lines of chains. The chains were connected to iron rings that were bolted and locked around the necks of at least forty children. The oldest was Chong’s age, an Indian girl with one eye puffed shut and a split lip. The youngest was no older than six. All of the kids were bruised, and each one looked absolutely terrified. A smoking pistol lay on the floor with a man’s severed hand still attached to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the room was a slaughterhouse. Five men lay on the floor, or sprawled over furniture, or in a heap on the bed. Three men were still on their feet. Tom was one; the other two were guards. One of the guards was wandering away from the fight, hands clamped to a ruined throat, eyes already fading into emptiness. The remaining guard held a machete in his hands but he, too, was backing away from this man, this thing that had burst into the room in a storm of death. The machete dropped to the floor as he brought his hands up in total surrender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire fight was over already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChong stared at Tom. Benny’s brother looked as cold and calm as if he was watering his rosebushes or cutting a slice of pie, even though his face was splashed with fresh blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is the hallway clear?” Tom asked in a disturbingly serene voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChong stammered an affirmative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom nodded. He extended his sword toward the remaining guard. “Are there any other guards on this floor?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“N-n-no! Two on the porch and us … I mean me. God … don’t kill me, please … I got kids of my own.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom stepped forward and touched the bloody sword tip to the guard’s cheek. “Do your kids have to fight in the pits?” The curl of his lip was the only clue to the emotion he was keeping in check behind his bland face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man flicked a guilty look at the children huddled by the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“These kids … I mean … hey, man, I was just doing what I was told. White Bear and his old man call the shots around here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom flicked the blood off his sword, careful not to let a single drop go anywhere near the kids, all of whom were locked into a moment of traumatized silence. He resheathed his sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Keys,” he said. The man very carefully dug into his pocket and then gingerly held out a ring of keys. Tom snatched them from him and tossed the ring to Chong. “Get them into the hall.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Chong rushed to free the captives, Tom walked forward, making the guard stumble backward until the man’s back hit the wall. Tom stopped, his face an inch from the terrified guard’s. “You know who I am?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes … oh God … please don’t … I know who you are … don’t …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom bared his teeth. “Where’s my brother?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e74\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBENNY PRESSED NIX BACK AGAINST THE WALL AS THE FIRST OF THE DARK shapes moved toward them. The pit they were in was thirty feet across, with large blank sections of wall interspersed with side tunnels. The torches were too high to reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mattress!” Nix blurted, and they rushed over to the stack of rotten old mattresses and began dragging them toward the tunnel with the zoms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny squatted and upended one and used it to block them from view. “Might not stop them,” he warned. “And my cadaverine’s worn off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Better than nothing,” she grunted as she dragged another one over and pulled it upright. There were only three mattresses, but they nicely blocked half the tunnels. “Maybe it’ll confuse them, slow them down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny jerked his head toward one of the open tunnels. There was no movement in that one, but torchlight spilled down from another opening around the far bend. Benny pulled Nix inside, and they peered up to see if White Bear or the crowd could see them. The crowd booed and yelled for the dead to go fetch their dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think we’re good,” whispered Nix. Immediately she pulled out the tails of her shirt and reached inside her clothes. Benny did the same, and they knelt down and placed several hidden items on the ground. When the guards had locked them in the empty hotel room, they had thought that the two teenagers were helpless; but Tom had spent the last seven months teaching them to never be helpless. He said that in ancient times a samurai warrior was never unarmed, even if he had no sword, knives, or spear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All weapons are made,” he once told them. “They’re fabricated from the things we find: wood, metal, rope, leather, stone. Nature always provides, but only a smart warrior can look at what circumstance offers and see the potential.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dust-and-decay-benny-imura-2/page-40.html","bookId":2582,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:44 PM"}
