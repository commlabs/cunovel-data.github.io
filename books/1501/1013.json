{"id":50710,"no":1013,"title":"Book 29, Chapter 33 - Daolord Kongsan","content":"\u003cp\u003ePlumesoar Hall was very close, and so Ji Ning was able to almost instantly fly back inside it. Per the rules of the Dao Alliance, it was absolutely forbidden to engage in acts of violence inside the restrictive spells protecting the various palaces and estates within the eight Sacred Cities. Anyone who violated this rule would be slain and their Dao destroyed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This fellow is pretty strong, but he probably wouldn’t dare to violate the rules of the entire Dao Alliance.” Ning relaxed slightly after hiding himself within the Plumesoar Hall. Even figures like Palace Lord Dawnstar or historical legends like Daolord Allgod hadn’t dared to challenge the Dao Alliance! The Dao Alliance’s roots were immeasurably deep, and it was the greatest organization of the entire Endless Territories. Challenge the Dao Alliance? The three Hegemons might have the power to do so, but even they wouldn’t actually carry it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What an enormous disturbance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is going on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe customers and servants inside Plumesoar Hall all stared outside. Although the battle between Ning and the gray-robed man had concluded quite quickly, it had caused quite a disturbance as well. As for Ning, he had no time to waste on the gazes of others; his attention was focused on what was happening outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoosh. Far away, a ball of black mist suddenly appeared at the margins of the frozen space. Moments later, that black mist solidified into a human figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a man dressed in long, beautiful black robes. He had fiery red hair and fiery red eyes that were filled with an evil, murderous intent. He was currently staring at Ning, hidden away within Plumesoar Hall. Ning was staring right back at this man. Their gazes collided in midair!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Quite bold. No wonder you dared to kill the disciple of myself, Kongsan.” Daolord Kongsan stood there calmly in empty space, emanating an aura of transcendant dominance. This was an aura that came from overwhelming self-confidence, which was in turn born from a person having reached an extremely high level cultivation that allowed him to roam the Endless Territories without meeting any superiors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kongsan?” When Ning heard this name, his heart turned cold. His star map had some records regarding some of the more famous Daolords of the Endless Territories. Although the records he had on Kongsan weren’t very detailed, he still had a rough idea as to how strong this person was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Daolord Kongsan.” Ning remained within the protective embrace of the Plumesoar Hall’s barriers as he said in a loud voice, “I imagine, given your power, you know what happened just now. Your disciple suddenly ambushed me with the intention of killing me. I didn’t cause any trouble for him! Since he struck to kill, I cannot be blamed for killing him instead. I only struck out with a single sword.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He ambushed you and wanted to kill you. He failed and you killed him instead. This is all very normal.” The distant Daolord Kongsan stared at Ning calmly, but Ning couldn’t help but feel a cold feeling in his heart. “He was still, however, my disciple. Since you killed my disciple, I am going to kill you. If you have the necessary patience, you should stay in Plumesoar Hall for the rest of your life. As soon as you leave it, I’ll kill you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was very calm, but the murderous intent within it was quite clear and heavy. There was nothing to negotiate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmph.” Ning narrowed his eyes, then turned and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cultivators and servants within Plumesoar Hall all watched curiously as they listened to Ning and Daolord Kongsan’s conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This white-robed Daolord is screwed. He actually pissed off Daolord Kongsan! Given Daolord Kongsan’s temper, he’s going to kill this kid no matter what.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Poor bastard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did he really think he could get away with killing Kongsan’s disciple?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But the white-robed Daolord is also quite formidable. He’s clearly just a Daolord of the Second Step, but he was able to kill Daolord Kongsan’s disciple with ease. That disciple had visited Plumesoar Hall on many occasions, often serving as his master’s errand boy. He was still, however, a Daolord of the Third Step. I never would’ve thought that he’d be killed in the blink of an eye. He didn’t even have the chance to beg his master to come save him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese cultivators and servants all chatted amongst themselves, with the servants of Plumesoar Hall being especially casual in their words. They might be weak, but they belonged to the Skywood Sect. There was an ironclad rule in Skywood City – disciples of the Skywood Sect were not to be touched! Not even Eternal Emperors would dare to violate this rule within the confines of Skywood City. This type of rule was a joint one shared throughout the eight Sacred Cities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoosh. Ning entered the hall once more. The cultivators and servants turned their gazes towards Ning, and they naturally stopped chattering about him. Ning had a solemn look on his face, and his forehead was furrowed as he frowned. Clearly, he was quite troubled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo have been targetd by Daolord Kongsan was indeed quite troublesome. Still, Ning wasn’t really afraid of him. The deceased Hegemon had given him two Dao-seals, after all, which contained the power of a full-force strike from the Hegemon. If push came to shove, he would just use one of them up! However, Ning knew exactly how valuable those two Dao-seals were. They were priceless treasures! The Sword Hegemon had only been willing to pay the price necessary to make them once he realized that he was definitely going to die. These two Dao-seals would be protective, life-saving talismans for Ning for a long time to come. Ning wouldn’t use them unless he truly had to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Senior.” The female attendant who had received Ning earlier walked over to him once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right. I heard that in a month from now, Plumesoar Hall will be holding a treasure auction?” Ning suddenly asked with a laugh. The nearby guests and attendants were all secretly amazed. This Daolord of the Second Step was still able to laugh at a time like this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe female attendant immediately replied, “Yes, senior. A month from now, Plumesoar Cloud will indeed hold a treasure auction. Quite a few treasures will be up for sale this time, and the reserve prices will be much lower than in the outside world. You might find something which is both cheap and useful.” The low reserve prices of the treasure auctions was a main reason why they were so attractive to cultivators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m being targeted by Daolord Kongsan, so I can’t leave for now. I have nothing better to do, so I figured I’d go check this treasure auction of yours out,” Ning laughed. “Give me a private room. I’ll wait a month for that treasure auction to begin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Done.” The female attendant nodded repeatedly. “Please follow me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were some very cheap seats for each treasure auction, but there were also private, secluded rooms. If you wished to purchase some extremely valuable treasures while keeping your identity private, you would generally use one of those private rooms. No one would disturb you so long as you remained inside – this was one of the rules which Plumesoar Hall had established long ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe attendants and guests once more began to speculate as they watched Ning leave with the female attendant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The white-robed Daolord looks pretty calm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Agreed. He knows that Daolord Kongsan is outside waiting for him, but he’s still able to relax and take part in the treasure auction.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In my opinion, he’s probably going to stay inside this hall for a very long period of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e……\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing couldn’t be bothered to respond to the gossip going on around him. Soon, he and the attendant both reached a private room. Daolords lived for extremely long periods of time; for them to arrive a few months early for a treasure auction was quite commonplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Senior, while you are in this private room, no one will disturb you unless you summon them first. Not even the members of Plumesoar Hall itself will disturb you, to say nothing of Daolord Kongsan,” the female attendant said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have faith in the Skywood Sect.” Ning nodded. “Now, there’s something I need you to do for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please tell me what you need, senior” the female attendant said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing nodded slowly. “I need an intelligence report regarding Daolord Kongsan’s abilities, the more detailed the better. It needs information on all his techniques and secret arts, as well as information on his previous opponents. I need as much information as your Skywood Sect can provide.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe female attendant couldn’t help but feel shocked, but she nodded. “As detailed as possible? The price will be quite high. It\u0027ll probably cost around a hundred thousand cubes of chaos nectar.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A hundred thousand is fine.” Ning nodded. The more powerful a cultivator was, the more expensive intelligence reports about them would be. The Brightshore Kingdom’s star map held information on virtually all the Daolords of the Endless Territories, but that information was fairly cursory in nature. To procure much more detailed individual intelligence reports was extremely difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give me a moment,” the female attendant said respectfully, then retreated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin the private room. Ning was originally there by himself, but moments later Pillsaint and Su Youji appeared by his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Master, what happened?” Su Youji immediately asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why did you put the two of us into the estate-world?” Pillsaint was puzzled as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We encountered a bit of trouble.” Ning narrated what had just happened to them. Su Youji and Pillsaint’s faces instantly turned pale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSu Youji said worriedly, “From what you are saying, it sounds as though this Daolord Kongsan is extremely powerful. What should we do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haha, no need to worry too much. We have all the food and drink we want here. Why worry about him?” Ning picked up a nearby canteen of wine and poured himself a cup, then began to sip it in a relaxed manner as he glanced sideways at Pillsaint and Su Youji. “Don’t just stand there like idiots. Sit down and have a cup with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSu Youji and Pillsaint were both feeling rather nervous, but they still sat down. After a short period of time drinking together, the sound of the door being knocked rang out. “Come in,” Ning said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe female attendant was outside. She handed a jde slip to Ning, then said respectfully, “Senior, all the information we have regarding Daolord Kongsan is here.” Skywood Sect not only engaged in the treasure trade, it also engaged in the intelligence trade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mm.” Ning put down his wine cup, then picked up the jade slip and began to read it carefully. As he read through the information, he tossed a storage treasure to the outsider woman. “You can leave now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe attendant looked through thestorage treasure, then left obediently. “If ther’s anything that you need, just summon me whenever you wish, senior.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNing nodded, and she shut the door behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kongsan.” Ning picked up the jade slip once more, studying all of the information regarding Daolord Kongsan which was within that jade slip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/desolate-era/de-book-29-chapter-32\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/desolate-era/de-book-29-chapter-34\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/desolate-era/de-book-29-chapter-33","bookId":1501,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:16:13 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:16:13 AM"}
