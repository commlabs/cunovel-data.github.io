But by the time twilight rolled around and I hadn\u0027t seen any sign of Katherine or Emily, I wished that I hadn\u0027t agreed to accompany Damon. My mind was still jumbled, and I wanted a night with Katherine to reassure me that my desire was leading me in the right direction. I loved her, but the practical, sensible side of me was having trouble disobeying Father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready?\" Damon asked, clad in his Confederate uniform, when he stopped by my bedroom at twilight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. It was too late to say no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" He grinned and clattered down the stairs. I glanced wistfully out the window toward the carriage house, then followed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going out to the camp,\" Damon yelled as we passed by Father\u0027s study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait!\" Father emerged from the study into the living room, several long branches filled with tiny, lilac-like purple flowers in his arms. Vervain. \"Wear this,\" he commanded, tucking a sprig into each of our breast pockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Y shouldn\u0027t have, Father,\" Damon said\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eou tersely, as he plucked the sprig out of his pocket and shoved it into his breeches pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve given you latitude, son, and given you a roof. Now all I ask is that you do this,\" Father said, slamming his meaty fist into his palm so hard, I saw him wince. Thankfully, Damon, usually so quick to pounce at any sign of weakness, didn\u0027t notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine, Father.\" Damon shrugged easily and spread his arms as if in defeat. \"I would be honored to wear your flower for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather\u0027s eyes flickered with rage, but he didn\u0027t say anything. Instead, he simply broke off another sprig and tucked it into Damon\u0027s coat pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" I mumbled as I accepted my own branch. My statement of thanks was less for the flower and more for Father showing mercy on Damon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be careful, boys,\" Father said, before retreating to his study.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon rolled his eyes as we walked outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Y shouldn\u0027t be so hard on him,\" I mumbled,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eou shivering in the night air. The summer-like day had become a chilly fall evening, but the mist that had been everywhere last night had lifted, giving us a been everywhere last night had lifted, giving us a crystal-clear view of the moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? He\u0027s hard on us.\" Damon snorted as he led the way to the stable. Mezzanotte and Jake were already bridled and stamping their hooves impatiently. \"I had Alfred get everything ready. Thought we\u0027d need a quick getaway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon swung his leg over Jake\u0027s back, then galloped him down the path and turned in the direction opposite of town. We rode in silence for at least a half hour. With just the sound of the hooves and the sight of the moon peeking through the dense foliage, it felt like we were riding into a dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, we began to hear sounds of flutes playing and laughter and the occasional gunshot. Damon directed us up over a hill toward a clearing. Tents were set up all over, and a piper played in the corner. Men were walking around, and dogs were stationed at the entrance. It was as if we\u0027d arrived at a mysterious, hidden party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, sir?\" Two Confederate soldiers came up to us, their rifles pointed toward us. Mezzanotte took a few steps back and whinnied nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soldier Damon Salvatore, sir! Here on leave from General Groom\u0027s camp down in Atlanta.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately, the two soldiers relaxed their rifles and tipped their hats at us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry \u0027bout that, soldier. We\u0027re gearin\u0027 up for battle, and we\u0027re losing our men like flies, before they even hit the battlefield,\" the taller soldier said, stepping up to pat Jake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Y and not because of typhus,\" the other,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ees, smaller, mustachioed soldier said, obviously pleased to share this information with us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Killings?\" Damon asked tersely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d you know?\" the first guard asked, stroking his rifle. I glanced at the ground, unsure what to do. I felt that Damon was getting us into a dangerous situation, but I didn\u0027t know what I could do to fix it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My brother and I are coming from Mystic Falls,\" Damon said, jerking his thumb back as if to prove that was the direction we came from. \"The next town over, past the forest. We\u0027ve had some of our own trouble. People are saying it\u0027s some type of animal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not unless it\u0027s an animal that only goes for the throat and leaves the rest of the body untouched,\" the mustachioed soldier said knowledgeably, his tiny eyes flicking back and forth between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm,\" Damon said, sounding suddenly uninterested. But then he changed the subject. \"Any good games of poker going on tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right there in that clearing by the oak trees.\" The small soldier pointed a little ways off into the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have a good evening, then. I thank you for your help,\" Damon said with exaggerated politeness. We walked in the direction the soldier pointed, until Damon stopped abruptly at a small circle of soldiers, huddled around a fire and playing cards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello! Soldier Damon Salvatore on leave from General Groom\u0027s boys,\" Damon said confidently as he slid off his horse and glanced around the faces lit up by the campfire. \"This is my brother, Stefan. Can we be dealt in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne ginger-haired soldier glanced at an older, grand-fatherly type whose arm was in a sling. He shrugged and gestured for us to sit on one of the logs set up around the fire. \"Don\u0027t see why not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdrenaline seeped through my veins as we settled down and took our hands. Mine was good: two aces and a king. I immediately threw in some rumpled notes from my pocket, making a bet with myself. If I won money, then everything would be fine with Katherine. And if I didn\u0027t, then ... well, I didn\u0027t want to think about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All in,\" I said confidently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter we settled the game, I wasn\u0027t surprised to emerge as the victor. I smiled as I took the pile of money and carefully put it in my pocket. I grinned in relief, finally feeling sure in my love for Katherine. I imagined what Katherine would say. Smart Stefan, maybe. Savvy Stefan. Or maybe she\u0027d simply laugh, showing her white teeth, and allow me to take her into my arms and twirl her around and around the room.... We played several more hands after that, during which I lost the money I had won, but I didn\u0027t care. The first hand had been the test, and now my heart and mind felt remarkably light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you thinking?\" Damon asked, taking a flask from his pocket. He held it toward me, and I took a long swig.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whiskey burned going down my throat, but I still craved more. It didn\u0027t seem that any of the other soldiers were up for another hand. The five we were playing with had drifted off to chew tobacco, drink more whiskey, or tearfully talk about their sweethearts back home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, brother, you can tell me,\" Damon encouraged. He took the flask, swigged from it, then passed it back toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took another, deeper drink and paused. Should I tell him? Any hesitation I had earlier had disappeared. After all, he was my brother. \"Well, I was thinking about how different Katherine is than any other girl I\u0027ve met ...,\" I began evasively. I knew I was treading into dangerous territory, but part of me was dying to know whether Damon also knew Katherine\u0027s secret. I took another sip of whiskey and coughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s she different?\" Damon asked, a smile curving on his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I mean she\u0027s not,\" I said, sobering up as I frantically tried to backtrack. \"I just meant that I noticed that she is--\" noticed that she is--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That she\u0027s a vampire?\" Damon interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy breath caught in my throat, and I blinked. I glanced around nervously. People were drinking, laughing, counting their winnings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Damon was simply sitting there, the same smile on his lips. I couldn\u0027t understand how he was smiling. And then a new, darker thought appeared in my mind. How did Damon know that Katherine was who she was? Had she told him? And had it been the same way, in the misty predawn, in bed? I shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So she\u0027s a vampire. What of it? She\u0027s still Katherine.\" Damon turned to look at me, urgency in his dark-brown eyes. \"And you won\u0027t say anything to Father. He\u0027s half crazy as it is,\" Damon said as he scuffed his boot against the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you find out?\" I couldn\u0027t stop myself from asking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, a shot was fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soldier down!\" a uniformed boy who looked to be about fourteen yelled as he charged from tent to tent. \"Soldier down! Attack! Out into the woods!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon\u0027s face paled. \"I need to help. Y little\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eou, brother, go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\" I asked, feeling torn and suddenly frightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon nodded tersely. \"If Father asks, I drank too much at the saloon and am sleeping it off somewhere.\" Another shot was fired, and Damon took off into the woods, blending into the sea of soldiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go!\" Damon yelled. I ran in the opposite direction to the now-abandoned camp and dug my heels into Mezzanotte, whispering in her velvety ears and imploring her to go faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMezzanotte rode through the forest faster than she ever had before; once across the Wickery Bridge, she turned, as if she knew exactly how to head home. But then she reared and whinnied. I held on with my thighs and saw a shadowy figure with golden-brown hair, arm-in-arm with another girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stiffened. No women would be out after dark unaccompanied by a man in the best of circumstances, but definitely not in these times. Not with the vampire attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe face turned, and in the reflection on the water I saw a pale, pointed face. Katherine. She was escorting little Anna from the apothecary. All I could see were the dark vines of Anna\u0027s curls, bouncing over her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Katherine!\" I yelled from the horse, with a strength I did not know I possessed. Now, instead of wanting to hold her, I wanted to use my arms to restrain her, to make her stop carrying out the awful thing she was about to do. I felt bile rise in my throat as I imagined finding a jagged branch and ramming it into her chest. Katherine didn\u0027t turn around. She held Anna\u0027s shoulders tighter and led her into the forest. I kicked Mezzanotte hard on the flanks, the wind whipping against my face as I desperately tried to catch up with them. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stefan-s-diaries-origins-the-vampire-diaries-1/page-18.html","bookId":2068,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:20:40 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:20:40 AM"}
