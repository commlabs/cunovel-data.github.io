A cut from his conversation with Szeto kept playing and replaying as he walked up from the Lodge toward Allen Street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The One speaks to me.

Drexler was pretty damn near the most together, focused guy he\u0027d ever met. But not yesterday. Yesterday he looked like he was being held together by spit and baling wire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad something gone wrong at the Order? Their High Council had an inside track on everything connected to the Change, and Drexler was Hank\u0027s connection to those bozos.

Hank had left half a dozen messages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly one thing to do. Go over there and get some face time, whether Drexler liked it or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHank reached Allen Street and found it at a standstill. Something must have happened on the outward-bound Williamsburg Bridge around the corner. He\u0027d planned on taking a cab but Drexler\u0027s place wasn\u0027t all that far away. He decided to walk. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-20.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
