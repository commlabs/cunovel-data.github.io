They’re done.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe twisted round, sought out the one who spoke. Before him was the trench, piled with corpses. ‘Is it the dead who now speak?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘As good as,’ came the reply. ‘You don’t understand, do you? We don’t tell you because we honour our enemy – they’re not Tiste Andii. They’re humans – who fight like demons.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw the man now. Only the upper half of his body was visible, the rest buried under bodies. Someone had judged him dead. Someone had made a mistake. But then Aparal saw that half his skull was gone, exposing the brain. ‘The Hust Legion—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Oh, you’d like that, wouldn’t you? But there’s no Hust Legion. There’s one man. One Hust sword. Slayer of dragons and slayer of hounds, slayer of a thousand Liosan … one man . And when you finally break through, Lord, may he cut you down – you Soletaken, you betrayers. Every one of you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you stood here, Kadagar Fant … if you stood here, you would finally see what we have done .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAparal retreated, made his way towards the gate. Yes, he would push through. He would step out on to that foreign shore. And, if he could, he would destroy this lone warrior. And then it will be over. Because that is all I want, now, for this to be over .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spied a messenger corps, a dozen or so runners standing just beyond the nearest legion. ‘Words to my kin!’ he barked. ‘Less than a thousand remain on the other side. And there is but one man with a Hust sword. Inform our lord – the time is now .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn end. Bless me, an end .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSheathing his bloody sword, he fixed his gaze on the gate. ‘There,’ he whispered. ‘ Now .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalfway across the bridge, Nimander paused, stared at the keep’s massive gates. The air was filling with smoke, and he could now hear the detonations. The sorcery of dragons, the Eleint doing what they did best. Destroying everything in their path .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe return of the Tiste Andii should not have been like this. In flames, in annihilation. He had felt his kin being torn away from him. They had veered over the Outer Marches: they had been flying in the company of Silanah. To honour her, of all things. She was of the royal household now, or so Nimander had wanted – another foolish conceit. In Draconic form, she was my father’s lover – but that was long ago . But Anomander Rake’s hunger for awakening the blood of the Eleint within him had waned. Even when faced with the ruination of Moon’s Spawn, he had not surrendered to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNimander could not even imagine the will that had denied such a … gift. Above Pale, he could have killed Tayschrenn – Korlat had said as much. He could have flown down from Moon’s Spawn, Silanah at his side, and brought fire and devastation to the Malazans. The sudden descent of terror from the skies, scattering the enemy, shattering the opposition arrayed against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, he waited, and when at last he veered into his Draconic form, it was to save a different city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ He would have done so for Pale, if not for the betrayal .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ But, Korlat, it was only the mages who broke their vow. Not the people of the city .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had nodded then, and looked across to her two companions. Prazek Goul, who had once been Orfantal’s swordmaster. And Dathenar Fandoris, abandoned spawn from a High Priestess and then, much later, Korlat’s own Mistress of Assassination. The three of them, all that remained of his father’s cadre of Soletaken dragons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrazek had said, ‘ No matter what, there would have been terrible destruction visited upon Pale. Had Anomander Rake veered into a dragon, Tayschrenn would have had no choice but to turn his fullest powers upon him. By the time the two were done, all of Pale would have been ashes. Instead, our lord descended into the city, and hunted down those wizards, taking them one by one. So, in truth, he did indeed save Pale .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Although ,’ added Dathenar, ‘ he could not have anticipated the revenge of the Moranth upon Pale’s citizens .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ The Malazans could have stopped that ,’ countered Prazek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the three had nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlinking, Nimander drew a deep breath, pushing away that gnawing hunger within him – to veer, to rise up, to join the Storm. Then he made his way across the bridge, and into the palace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the shadows of the entrance, Apsal’ara stepped out to block his path. ‘Lord Nimander, there is a Tiste Andii woman upon the throne.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So Korlat told me. She has bound Silanah – I must convince her—’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-287.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
