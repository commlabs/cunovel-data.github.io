I just felt too shaky to drive after being at the hospital with Caleb and everything.\" She swal owed. \"I\u0027m sorry I missed Margaret\u0027s dance recital after al .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Judith patted Elena\u0027s knee with one cool hand without taking her eyes off the road. \"I told Margaret that Caleb got hurt and you had to take care of him. She understood. Right now I\u0027m worried about you. It must have been a shock to find him like that, especial y when you realized it was someone you knew. What exactly happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena shrugged and repeated the lie she\u0027d told the police. \"I just found him lying there when I went to visit Mom and Dad.\" Elena cleared her throat before continuing. \"The hospital\u0027s keeping him for a couple of days. They think he\u0027s got a bad concussion and they want to watch and make sure his brain doesn\u0027t swel . He woke up a little bit in the ambulance but was real y groggy and didn\u0027t remember what had happened.\" Which was lucky, Elena thought. What if he\u0027d said he was attacked by Elena Gilbert\u0027s boyfriend, who had something weird going on with his teeth? What if he\u0027d said her boyfriend was a monster? It would be last fal al over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Judith frowned sympathetical y and shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wel , Caleb\u0027s lucky you came along. He could have been lying there for days before anyone went looking for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, lucky,\" said Elena hol owly. She rol ed the bottom of her T-shirt between her fingers and was startled to realize she stil had her bathing suit on under her clothes. The picnic that afternoon seemed like it had taken place a mil ion years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen something Aunt Judith said struck her. \"What do you mean, he could have been lying there for days before anyone looked for him? What about his aunt and uncle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tried cal ing them after you cal ed me, but it seems that Caleb\u0027s been fending for himself for quite a while. When I reached them, they were out of town on vacation, and frankly they didn\u0027t seem like they were too concerned about their nephew, even when I told them what had happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed heavily. \"I\u0027l go visit him tomorrow and bring him some of the flowers from our garden he\u0027s been working so hard on. He\u0027l like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh,\" said Elena slowly. \"I thought he told me he came here to stay with his aunt and uncle because they were so upset about Tyler being missing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe so,\" Aunt Judith said dryly, \"but the Smal woods seem to be doing pretty wel now. They said that in their opinion, Tyler wil come home when he\u0027s good and ready. That boy was always a little out of control. It sounds like Caleb is more worried about Tyler than they are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pul ed into the driveway of their house, and Elena fol owed her inside to where Robert was reading his newspaper at the kitchen table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena, you look exhausted,\" he said, folding the paper and looking up at her in concern. \"Are you al right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m okay,\" she said numbly. \"It\u0027s just been a long day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought she had never made more of an\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunderstatement in her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wel , Margaret\u0027s gone to bed, but we saved you some dinner,\" Aunt Judith said, making a move toward the refrigerator. \"It\u0027s a chicken casserole, and there\u0027s some salad. You must be starving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut suddenly Elena felt sick. She\u0027d been suppressing al her feelings about Stefan and his attack on Caleb, keeping the images tamped down so she could get on with the business of dealing with the police and the staff at the hospital and her own family. But she was tired and her hands were shaking. She knew that she couldn\u0027t keep everything under control for much longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want anything,\" she said, backing away. \"I can\u0027t... I\u0027m not hungry, Aunt Judith. Thank you, though. I just want to take a bath and go to bed.\" She turned and hurried out of the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elena! You have to eat something,\" she heard Aunt Judith cry exasperatedly behind her as she hurried up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe solid-sounding murmur of Robert\u0027s voice broke in:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Judith, let her go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena ducked into the bathroom and closed the door behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and Margaret shared the hal bathroom, and she busied herself with emptying Margaret\u0027s bath toys from the tub, keeping her mind careful y blank: a pink rubber ducky, a pirate ship, a stack of gaily colored plastic cups. A goofily smiling purple seahorse looked up at her with painted blue eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the tub was empty, Elena ran the water as hot as she could stand and poured in a generous dol op of apricot-scented bubble bath from a bottle that promised to soothe her spirit while rejuvenating her skin. Soothing and rejuvenating sounded good, although Elena had her doubts about how much she could reasonably expect from a bottle of bubble bath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the tub was ful and frothy with a thick layer of bubbles, Elena quickly undressed and stepped into the steaming water. It stung at first, but she eased herself in bit by bit, gradual y getting accustomed to the temperature. Once she was comfortable, she lay back in the water, her hair floating out like a mermaid\u0027s, the sounds of the house muffled by the water over her ears, and let the thoughts she\u0027d been avoiding come at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears overflowed her eyes and trickled down her cheeks to join the bathwater. She had believed that everything was going to be normal now that they were back home, that things were going to be good again. When she and her friends had gotten the Guardians to send them back and to change things, to reverse the deaths, to fix the broken, to make everything the way it would have been if nothing dangerous had touched the little town of Fel \u0027s Church, she had thought that it would make her life simple and easy. She would have her family, her friends, her Stefan. But it wasn\u0027t going to work, was it? It wasn\u0027t ever going to be that way, not for Elena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as she\u0027d come back to town, the very first day she\u0027d stepped outside into the sunshine of a Fel \u0027s Church summer, something dark and evil and supernatural had started stalking her and her friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as for Stefan... God... Stefan. What was happening to him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she closed her eyes, she saw Caleb flying through the air and heard that horrible, final-sounding crack that Caleb\u0027s head had made as it connected with the marble of the mausoleum. What if Caleb never ful y recovered? What if this cute, innocent guy, this guy whose parents had died and left him like hers had died and left her, was broken forever because of Stefan?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan. How had he become the kind of person who could do something like that? Stefan, who felt guilty about the animals he took blood from, the doves and rabbits and deer of the forest. The Stefan who she knew at the deepest level of her soul, who she thought kept nothing from her -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat Stefan would never have harmed a human being like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElena lay in the bathtub until the water got cold and her tears had stopped. Then she got out, drained the tub, dried her hair, brushed her teeth, put on a nightgown, cal ed good night to Aunt Judith and Robert, and climbed into bed. She did not want to write in her diary. Not tonight. She switched off the light and lay flat on her back, staring into the darkness - the same blackness, she thought, as Damon\u0027s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon had been a monster, she knew - he had kil ed, although not as blithely as he pretended; he had manipulated people and enjoyed it; he had haunted and hated Stefan for hundreds of years - but she had also seen the lost little boy he kept locked inside him. He had loved her, she had loved him, and he had died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she loved Stefan. Desperately, devotedly, undeniably. She loved the sincerity in his eyes, his pride, his courtly manners, his honor, and his intel igence. She loved that he had rejected the monster that lurked inside him, the one that had driven so many vampires to terrible acts. She loved the sorrow he held - for his past, for his hatred and jealousy of Damon, for the terrible things he had seen. And she loved the hope that always sprang up in him, the strength of wil Stefan possessed that al owed him to keep fighting back the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond al that, she loved Stefan. But she was afraid. She had thought she knew him inside and out, that she could see clear through to the innermost reaches of his soul. That wasn\u0027t true, not anymore. Not since the Guardians had stripped her powers, severing their psychic connection and reverting her back to a normal, human girl. Elena rol ed over and buried her face in the pil ow. She knew the truth now. No matter what the Guardians had done for her, she would never be a normal girl. Her life would never be simple. Tragedy and horror would fol ow her forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, there was nothing Elena could do to change her destiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-phantom-the-vampire-diaries-1/page-19.html","bookId":2066,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:16:26 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:16:26 AM"}
