He measured his words against his fury and rising fear, and cast it all at the president. “Goddamn, but you’re being shortsighted, sir! If the war runs on, it won’t just be Atlanta that falls to the plague. Remember the Fiddlehead. Remember the numbers, and the predictions: the continent will fall within the decade if we cannot stop this madness and force a conclusion. Possibly the world!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNelson Wellers laughed ruefully. “It’s not enough to save our own skins, or the entire nation.” He sighed. “No, we must save the world as well. All from this library.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLincoln gave a crooked shrug. “There are worse places from whence to mount a defense of civilization.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant seemed to agree, but he was flustered, and he rambled. “They threatened me, Abe. Not just me, but Julia—they’ve threatened her. That terrible woman, that dragon in a hat. She’s the one who did this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where is Julia now?” his old friend asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Baltimore, but that’s not far enough away to keep her safe from Haymes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon’s nails dug into his palm. He fought to keep from hitting something for emphasis, but managed to restrain himself for only a few seconds before taking a swing at a bookcase. He knocked it so hard that it rocked precariously, then settled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For God’s sake!” he shouted. “Have you not heard a thing? Baltimore won’t be far enough. New York won’t be far enough. Mexico won’t, and Argentina won’t. Canada won’t. The Department of Alaska won’t! There will be no place in this hemisphere far enough away to protect anyone from this walking plague!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNelson Wellers positioned his lean frame between Gideon and the other two men with his hands up. “You’re right. We know you’re right—we’ve already said as much. But in the short term, we must take what action we can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We don’t have time for the short term!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWellers gave up, flung his upraised hands into the air, and finally hollered back. “You’re the one who wants to stop a damn news story before morning! You’re wanted for murder. That’s a short-term problem, now, isn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, for Christ’s sake!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gentlemen!” Lincoln tried to roar, but it came out as a cough. Grant went to his side, and Nelson looked back to make sure that it wasn’t any worse than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon did not back down. He mimicked Wellers’s tone when he said, “They want you dead. That’s a short-term problem, too, now, isn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Short term for you—somewhat longer for me! But yes, fine. It serves my point,” Wellers said, struggling to calm himself. “I would prefer to survive. You would prefer to stay out of prison. The Union must be preserved. The war must end. The weapon must be stopped. The walking plague must be addressed. We need stepping stones, Gideon. Stepping stones.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon argued, “How are we supposed to stop it? We don’t even know where it’s headed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Executive order!” cried Grant. “I do still wield some authority, you know. I’m only the president, as I’ve been reminded more than once in the last week.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why not send an executive order now?” Wellers asked plaintively. “Recall the project, bring the weapon home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrant fidgeted like an angry man, pacing with a stomp. “Because no one will admit that it exists. I can’t recall the project; I have to recall the mission itself. And I can’t find it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA disquieting pause fell, and then the doctor said, “Someone will. Someone has to. Maybe … maybe Troost’ll hear something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLincoln finished his coughing fit, then rallied himself to speak. “We’ve heard nothing from him since yesterday morning, and no mention of Maynard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If anyone can track it down, he can,” Wellers said with desperate confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon didn’t argue, but he worried all the same. Troost was one of a kind, but he already had one mission on deck: bringing the Bardsleys to safety on the northern side of the line. He could swing the impossible, yes, absolutely. But how many impossible things could he juggle at once?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrimly, he warned, “We can count on Kirby Troost to do his job, and more. But right now, we need a plan. We need to get our story straight and our actions in order before Haymes makes her next move.” He straightened the bookcase he’d knocked ajar in his moment of anger, nudging it back into place and setting two books aright. “We need to send word to our operatives before the police find their way back here, as they inevitably shall. And when Troost finishes evacuating my family, he’ll be back. We must be certain that we are ready for him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Monday morning, Maria awoke to a knock on her hotel room door. She threw her coat over her dressing gown and fished around on the cold wood floor for her slippers, but couldn’t find them, so she gave up and tiptoed from rug to rug, turning up the heat as she passed the radiator. “I’m coming,” she called sleepily. She wondered what time it was, but could see through the crack in the curtains that it must be an hour past dawn at least. She hadn’t meant to sleep so late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry Epperson was staying right across the hall, so she assumed that it must be him, but when she opened the door, she found an errand boy of perhaps ten or eleven years old with a stack of telegrams in his fist. “Are you Miss Boyd?” he asked. She nodded. He thrust the loose papers forward. “Here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” she said, rubbing her eyes. Seeing that the boy lingered, she added, “One moment, dear.” Her bag was sitting next to the washbasin. She stuffed her fingers into the side pocket and pulled out some pennies. “Here you go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed the door behind him and sorted the messages by the time they’d been sent—which was trickier than it should’ve been, as they were entirely out of order. But once she’d corrected the situation, she knew she needed to rouse Henry immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe located her slippers, which had been kicked beneath the bed. She pulled on a pair of socks before donning them, not caring how silly it looked and doubting that anyone would notice. Across the hall she went, where she rapped her fist heartily, repeatedly on Henry’s door. “Henry? Are you up yet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, ma’am,” he said through the door, then opened it with a smile. “I’ve got some coffee in here. Can I talk you into sharing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Coffee sounds wonderful.” She stepped past him as he held the door ajar. “But there’s no time to dillydally!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked confused. “Not even for coffee?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An errand boy brought me these.” She showed him the notes. “They’ve been piling up overnight, apparently. One in particular is marked for urgent, immediate delivery, but it would seem that the taps aren’t manned as thoroughly as one might wish.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry shook his head. “The military missives get first handling. Civilian messages get processed whenever the intake officer feels like sorting them out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s a bum deal if you need to send a note in a hurry,” she complained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Far be it from me to argue with you. So what’s the rush?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fed him the telegrams one by one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSUMMARY OF NURSING NOTES RECEIVED STOP AGREE ON ALL POINTS REGARDING GAS AND WEAPONS PROJECT DESIGNATED MAYNARD STOP WILL EXPECT REPORT ON ROBERTSON UPON YOUR RETURN FRIDAY STOP UNCLE A\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMAYNARD IS ON THE MOVE STOP AUTHORIZATION GIVEN SANS UNCLE G STOP TARGETS CIVILIAN NOT MILITARY STOP ALERT OUR COUSIN KT TO WITHDRAW TO OTHER SIDE OF MD IMMEDIATELY STOP YOURS DR W ON AUTHORITY AND APPROVAL OF UNCLE A\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“MD?” Henry frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mason-Dixon, I should think,” she replied. “But Project Maynard … if Troost was right, now’s the time to really worry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, I’m already worried plenty,” he said, and fiddled with the small slip of paper. “Civilian targets. That’s not good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not a surprise, either. Everything I’ve heard of Haymes suggests she’s utterly soulless. But it doesn’t stop there. Look, here’s the next one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDO NOT RETURN TO DC STOP FIND OUR COUSIN KT FOR ASSISTANCE STOP MOST LIKELY TARGETS LARGE CITIES STOP MAYNARD COULD CLEAR A SQUARE MILE STOP RESULTING CLOUD MAY TRAVEL MILES FURTHER STOP WILL SEND WHATEVER HELP WE CAN MANAGE STOP\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t even know who sent this one,” she said in a whisper. “Dr. Wellers, I expect, though it might be Dr. Bardsley.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry didn’t dwell on that part. “Oh, God,” he said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We need to find Kirby Troost, unless you think ‘KT’ stands for anybody else. But it’s his job to get Gideon’s family out of the South. I’m not sure how much assistance he can be to us until he does.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled weakly. “Only because you don’t know Kirby. He can handle more than one task at a time, and you can bet he’ll have some ideas and some connections. He always does. Come on—get yourself dressed, and I’ll get us a carriage. A clean carriage,” he emphasized, meaning one that wouldn’t need a driver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Five minutes, and I’ll meet you downstairs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn five minutes she dressed herself, threw on her boots, and lit a tiny fire in the enamel basin to destroy the telegrams. When they were reduced entirely to ashes, she grabbed her tapestry cloth bag and dashed down the stairs to find Henry standing beside a tiny cabriolet with a puttering, sputtering engine that shook the whole frame as it idled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“After you, ma’am,” he said, holding the door open and offering his hand for her to climb up inside. She took it and ascended into the narrow cab, adjusting her skirts so he could shut the door. He crawled up into the other side, shut his own door, and adjusted the levers and wheel. He wrenched the vehicle into gear and it rambled forward, then he hit the brakes to avoid hitting a newspaper seller who’d dropped something in the road. “Sorry!” he shouted out the window. “Sorry,” he said again, and set the car moving forward, more carefully this time. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fiddlehead-the-clockwork-century-5/page-36.html","bookId":1671,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:21:33 PM"}
