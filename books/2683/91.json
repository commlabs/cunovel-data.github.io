I notice that the hand mirror I saw by the sink isn\u0027t there anymore. A razor blade and a small transparent straw sit by a bottle of perfume and I am not imagining this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" she asks suddenly, turning around. \"Why are you still here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because...\" I smile sadly. \"You\u0027re... my ideal mate?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A mirror\u0027s your ideal mate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe... \" I start, haltingly. \"Maybe if you didn\u0027t expect so much from me you might not be so... disappointed,\" I finally admit, and then, watching her reflection in the mirror, \"Don\u0027t cry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not crying,\" she says, surprised. \"I\u0027m yawning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd back down in the lobby, on my way outside, dazed, shuffling across the marble floor, I bump into Tristan, an ex-model who deals drugs, chatting with Ashton, and Tristan\u0027s magnetic in a gorgeous kind of way and though I\u0027m totally absent right now I\u0027m able to instinctively shake his hand, make the prerequisite small talk, avoid the obvious (Buddy Seagull\u0027s column, the stains on my shirt, the bruise above my eyebrow), trade compliments about our hair, recommend one or two cool foreign movies, a new band from Nevada (\"a really happening state,\" Tristan assures me), and then we move on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, on the steps leading down to the sidewalk, I turn around, and through the lobby doors I see Tristan getting into the elevator and I want to ask him who he\u0027s going to see and then maybe buy a couple of grams but instead I start panicking because I make a connection and Tristan spots me staring at him and he gives a little wave just as the elevator doors close and a horrible vision breaks open in front of me of Chloe in an ambulance, another detox center in the desert somewhere, another series of failed suicide attempts followed up with a successful one and I cry out and try to run back into the lobby but crew members are struggling to hold me back and I\u0027m crying out \"No but why but why this wasn\u0027t in the script\" until I collapse and a technician props me up on the steps where I\u0027m still freaking out and shouting \"But you don\u0027t understand you don\u0027t understand\" and suddenly the director kneels beside me and gently tells the two crew members to let go, that it\u0027s okay, shhh. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-91.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
