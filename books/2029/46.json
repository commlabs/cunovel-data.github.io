{"id":108466,"no":46,"title":"Page 46","content":"\u003cp\u003eHealer Knits Fire and Cerulean walked through the door together. The Healer handed me a tall glass of water. It didn\u0027t feel as cold as the first-my fingers were cold with fear now. The dark-skinned woman had something for me, too. She handed me a flat rectangle with a handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you would want to see,\" Knits Fire said with a warm smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tension flooded out of me. There was no suspicion or fear. Just more kindness from the souls who had dedicated their lives to Healing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCerulean had given me a mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held it up and then tried to stifle my gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face looked the way I remembered it from San Diego. The face I\u0027d taken for granted there. The skin was smooth and peachy across my right cheekbone. If I looked carefully, it was just a little lighter and pinker in color than the tan on the other cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a face that belonged to Wanderer, the soul. It belonged here, in this civilized place where there was no violence and no horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized why it was so easy to lie to these gentle creatures. Because it felt right to talk with them, because I understood their communication and their rules. The lies could be... maybe should be true. I should be filling a Calling somewhere, whether teaching at a university or serving food in a restaurant. A peaceful, easy life contributing to a greater good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think?\" the Healer asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I look perfect. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was my pleasure to heal you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at myself again, seeing details beyond the perfection. My hair was ragged-dirty, with uneven ends. There was no gloss to it-homemade soap and poor nutrition were to blame for that. Though the Healer had cleaned the blood from my neck, it was still smudged with purple dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s time I called the camping trip quits. I need to clean up,\" I murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you camp often?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In all my free time, lately. I... can\u0027t seem to keep away from the desert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must be brave. I find the city much more comfortable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not brave-just different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the mirror, my eyes were familiar rings of hazel. Dark gray on the outside, a circle of moss green, and then another circle of caramel brown around the pupil. Underlying it all, a faint shimmer of silver that would reflect the light, magnify it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie? Mel asked urgently, beginning to feel nervous. I was too comfortable here. She could see the logic of the other path laid out before me, and that frightened her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know who I am, I told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked, then looked back at the friendly faces beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" I said again to the Healer. \"I suppose I\u0027d better be on my way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s very late. You could sleep here if you\u0027d like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not tired. I feel... perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Healer grinned. \"No Pain does that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCerulean walked me to the reception area. She put her hand on my shoulder as I stepped through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart beat faster. Had she noticed that my pack, once flat, was now bulging?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be more careful, dear,\" she said, and patted my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will. No more hikes in the dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled and went back to her desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept my pace even as I walked through the parking lot. I wanted to run. What if the Healer looked in her cabinets? How soon would she realize why they were half empty?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe car was still there, in the pocket of darkness created by a gap between streetlights. It looked empty. My breath came fast and uneven. Of course it should look empty. That was the whole point. But my lungs didn\u0027t calm until I could glimpse the vague shape under the blanket on the backseat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened the door and put the backpack on the passenger seat-it settled there with a reassuring clatter-then I climbed in and shut the door. There was no reason to slam the locks down; I ignored the urge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay?\" Jared whispered as soon as the door was closed. His voice was a strained, anxious rasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shh,\" I said, keeping my lips as still as I could. \"Wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove past the bright entrance and answered Cerulean\u0027s wave with one of my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Making friends?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were on the dark road. No one was watching me anymore. I slumped in the seat. My hands started to shake. I could allow that, now that it was over. Now that I\u0027d succeeded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All souls are friends,\" I told him, using my normal volume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\" he demanded again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m healed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stretched my left arm across my body, so he could see the tiny pink line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sucked in a surprised breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blanket rustled; he sat up and then climbed through the space between the seats. He pushed the backpack out of the way, then pulled it onto his lap, testing its weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up at me as we passed under a streetlamp, and he gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your face!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s healed, too. Naturally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised one hand, holding it in the air near my cheek, unsure. \"Does it hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not. It feels like nothing happened to it in the first place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers brushed the new skin. It tingled, but that was from his touch. Then he was back to business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did they suspect anything? Do you think they\u0027ll call the Seekers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I told you they wouldn\u0027t be suspicious. They didn\u0027t even check my eyes. I was hurt, so they healed me.\" I shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you get?\" he asked, opening the drawstrings on the backpack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The right things for Jamie... if we get back in time...\" I glanced at the clock on the dashboard automatically, though the hours it marked were meaningless. \"And more for the future. I only took what I understood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be back in time,\" he promised. He examined the white containers. \"Smooth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a necessity. But I know what it does, so...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, digging through the bag. He muttered the names to himself. \"No Pain? Does it work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. \"It\u0027s amazing. If you stab yourself, I could show you... That\u0027s a joke.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was staring at me with an expression I didn\u0027t understand. His eyes were wide, like something had deeply surprised him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" My joke hadn\u0027t been that bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did it.\" His tone was full of wonder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wasn\u0027t that the idea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but... I guess I didn\u0027t really think we were going to make it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t? Then why...? Why did you let me try?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe answered in a soft almost-whisper. \"I figured it was better to die trying than to live without the kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, my throat was choked with emotion. Mel was too overcome to speak as well. We were a family in that one instant. All of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cleared my throat. No need to feel things that would only come to nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was very easy. Probably any of you could get away with it, if you acted naturally. She did look at my neck.\" I touched it reflexively. \"Your scar is too obviously homemade, but with the medicines I took, Doc could fix that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt any of us could act so natural.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. \"Yes. It\u0027s easy for me. I know what they expect.\" I laughed briefly to myself. \"I\u0027m one of them. If you trusted me, I could probably get you anything in the world you wanted.\" I laughed again. It was just the stress fading, making me giddy. But it was funny to me. Did he realize that I would do exactly that for him? Anything in the world he wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do trust you,\" he whispered. \"With all our lives, I trust you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he had trusted me with every single human life. His, and Jamie\u0027s, and everyone else\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" I whispered back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did it,\" he repeated in wonder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to save him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie is going to live, Mel rejoiced. Thank you, Wanda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnything for them, I told her, and then I sighed, because it was so true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter reattaching the tarps when we reached the wash, Jared took over the driving. The way was familiar to him, and he drove faster than I would have. He had me get out before he pulled the car into its impossibly small hiding place under the rock slide. I waited for the sound of rock against metal, but Jared found a way in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then we were back in the jeep and flying through the night. Jared laughed, triumphant, as we jolted across the open desert, and the wind carried his voice away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s the blindfold?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanda, if you wanted to turn us in, you had your chance. No one can deny that you\u0027re one of us now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about that. \"I think some still could. It would make them feel better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your some need to get over themselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was shaking my head now, picturing our reception. \"It\u0027s not going to be easy, getting back in. Imagine what they\u0027re thinking right now. What they\u0027re waiting for...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer. His eyes narrowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jared... if they... if they don\u0027t listen... if they don\u0027t wait...\" I started talking faster, feeling a sudden pressure, trying to get him all the information before it was too late. \"Give Jamie the No Pain first-lay that on his tongue. Then the Inside Clean spray-he just has to inhale it. You\u0027ll need Doc to -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, hey! You\u0027re going to be the one giving the directions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But let me tell you how -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Wanda. It\u0027s not going to go down that way. I\u0027ll shoot anyone who touches you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jared -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t panic. I\u0027ll aim low, and then you can use that stuff to heal \u0027em back up again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If that\u0027s a joke, it\u0027s not funny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No joke, Wanda.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s the blindfold?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed his lips together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I had my old shirt-Jeb\u0027s raggy hand-me-down. That would work almost as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This will make it a little bit easier for them to let us in,\" I said as I folded it up into a thick band. \"And that means getting to Jamie faster.\" I tied it over my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was quiet for a time. The jeep bounced along the uneven terrain. I remembered nights like this when Melanie had been the passenger...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m taking us right to the caves. There\u0027s a place the jeep will be fairly well hidden for a day or two. It will save us time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. Time was the key now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Almost there,\" he said after a minute. He exhaled. \"They\u0027re waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard him fumbling beside me, heard a metal clank as he pulled the gun from the backseat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t shoot anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No promises.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop!\" someone shouted. The sound carried in the empty desert air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jeep slowed and then idled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just us,\" Jared said. \"Yes, yes, look. See? I\u0027m still me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was hesitation from the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look-I\u0027m bringing the jeep in under cover, okay? We\u0027ve got meds for Jamie, and we\u0027re in a hurry. I don\u0027t care what you\u0027re thinking, you\u0027re not going to get in my way tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jeep pulled forward. The sound changed and echoed as he found his cover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, Wanda, everything\u0027s fine. Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI already had the pack on my shoulders. I got out of the jeep carefully, not sure where the wall was. Jared caught my searching hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Up you go,\" he said, and lifted me over his shoulder again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t as secure as before. He used only one arm to hold me. The other must have had the gun. I didn\u0027t like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I was worried enough to be grateful for it when I heard the running footsteps approaching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jared, you idiot!\" Kyle shouted. \"What were you thinking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ease up, Kyle,\" Jeb said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she hurt?\" Ian demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get out of my way,\" Jared said, his voice calm. \"I\u0027m in a hurry. Wanda\u0027s in perfect shape, but she insisted on being blindfolded. How is Jamie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hot,\" Jeb said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanda\u0027s got what we need.\" He was moving fast now, sliding downhill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can carry her.\" Ian, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s fine where she is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m really okay,\" I told Ian, my voice bouncing with Jared\u0027s movement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUphill again, a steady jog despite my weight. I could hear the others running with us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew when we were through to the main cavern-the angry hiss of voices swelled around us, turning into a clamor of sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out of my way,\" Jared roared over their voices. \"Is Doc with Jamie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t make out the answer. Jared could have put me down, but he was in too much of a hurry to pause for that second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe angry voices echoed behind us, the sound constricting as we entered the smaller tunnel. I could feel where we were now, follow the turns in my head as we raced through the junction to the third sleeping hall. I could almost count the doors as they passed me invisibly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJared jerked to a halt and let the sudden stop slide me down from his shoulder. My feet hit the floor. He ripped the blindfold from my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur room was lit by several of the dim blue lanterns. Doc was standing rigidly, as if he\u0027d just sprung to his feet. Kneeling beside him, her hand still holding a wet cloth to Jamie\u0027s forehead, was Sharon. Her face was almost unrecognizable, it was so contorted with fury. Maggie was struggling to her feet on Jamie\u0027s other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie still lay limp and red, eyes closed, his chest barely moving to pull in air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You!\" Sharon spit, and then she launched herself from her crouch. Like a cat, she sprang at Jared, nails reaching for his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJared caught her hands and twisted her away from him, pulling her arms behind her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie looked as if she was about to join her daughter, but Jeb stepped around the struggling Sharon and Jared to stand toe-to-toe with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let her go!\" Doc cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJared ignored him. \"Wanda-heal him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc moved to put himself between Jamie and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doc,\" I choked. The violence in the room, swirling around Jamie\u0027s still form, scared me. \"I need your help. Please. For Jamie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc didn\u0027t move, his eyes on Sharon and Jared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"C\u0027mon, Doc,\" Ian said. The little room was too crowded, claustrophobic, as Ian came to stand with his hand on my shoulder. \"You gonna let the kid die for your pride?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not pride. You don\u0027t know what these foreign substances will do to him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He can\u0027t get much worse, can he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doc,\" I said. \"Look at my face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc wasn\u0027t the only one who responded to my words. Jeb, Ian, and even Maggie looked and then did a double take. Maggie glanced away quickly, angry that she\u0027d betrayed any interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" Doc demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll show you. Please. Jamie doesn\u0027t need to suffer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoc hesitated, staring at my face, and then let out a big sigh. \"Ian\u0027s right-he can\u0027t get much worse. If this kills him...\" He shrugged, and his shoulders slumped. He took a step back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Sharon cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one paid any attention to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knelt beside Jamie, yanking the backpack off my shoulders and tugging it open. I fumbled until I found the No Pain. A bright light switched on beside me, pointed at Jamie\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Water, Ian?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI twisted the lid open and pinched out one of the little tissue squares. When I pulled Jamie\u0027s chin down, his skin burned my hand. I laid the square on his tongue and then held out my hand without looking up. Ian placed the bowl of water in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarefully, I dripped enough water into his mouth to wash the medicine down his throat. The sound of his swallow was dry and painful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI searched frantically for the thinner spray bottle. When I found it, I had the lid off and the mist sprayed into the air above him in one fast movement. I waited, watching his chest until he inhaled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI touched his face, and it was so hot! I scrambled for the Cool, praying it would be easy to use. The lid screwed off, and I found that the cylinder was full of more tissue squares, light blue this time. I breathed a sigh of relief and placed one on Jamie\u0027s tongue. I picked up the bowl again and dribbled another mouthful of water through his parched lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis swallow was quicker this time, less strained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother hand touched Jamie\u0027s face. I recognized Doc\u0027s long bony fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doc, do you have a sharp knife?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a scalpel. You want me to open the wound?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, so I can clean it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought about trying that... to drain it, but the pain...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll feel nothing now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at his face,\" Ian leaned in beside me to whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJamie\u0027s face was no longer red. It was a natural, healthy tan. The sweat still glistened on his brow, but I knew it was just left over from before. Doc and I touched his forehead at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s working. Yes! Exultation swept through both Mel and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remarkable,\" Doc breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fever has cooled, but the infection may remain in his leg. Help me with his wound, Doc.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Sharon, could you hand me -\" he began absentmindedly. Then he looked up. \"Oh. Ah, Kyle, do you mind handing me that bag right there by your foot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scooted down so that I was over the red, swollen cut. Ian redirected the light so I could see it clearly. Doc and I both rustled through our bags at the same time. He came up with the silver scalpel, a sight that sent a quiver of unease down my spine. I ignored it and readied the bigger Clean spray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t feel it?\" Doc checked, hesitating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" Jamie croaked. His eyes were open wide, roaming the room until they found my face. \"Hey, Wanda. What\u0027s going on? What\u0027s everyone doing here?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-host-the-host-1/page-46.html","bookId":2029,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:21:35 PM"}
