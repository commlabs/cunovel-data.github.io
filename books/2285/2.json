Help me. I didn’t slide back into drugs—I didn’t! And it wasn’t an accident. I was killed, Liv. It was murder. Help me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strangled-sounding scream escaped her lips; she heard that much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she keeled over on top of Marcus Danby’s body in a dead faint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meeting Dustin Blake had been asked to attend was being held at the General Bixby Tavern, just off the I-95 South exit in northern Virginia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDustin knew it well. He’d often stopped there when he was a kid and his parents had taken him to D.C.—a place they’d both loved. Being historians, they would have lived at the Smithsonian if they could. At the time, he’d thought that the tavern’s owners had hired an actor to portray General Bixby. Bixby had been kind to him and full of information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDustin remembered being humiliated and hurt, as only a kid could be, when he’d discovered that there was no actor and his parents were concerned about his invention of imaginary friends. Then, of course, he’d disturbed them both by knowing things only the general—or a much older person, and an expert on the Civil War—would know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had led to a number of sessions with a psychiatrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDustin had then made the sage decision to agree that General Bixby was an imaginary friend. That had brought about deep thought on the part of his parents—and it had also brought about his sister. His extremely academic parents had worried that an only child might be given to such flights of fancy because he was lonely. So they’d set forth to add to their family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was all right. He loved his sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled off the interstate and took an exit that led nowhere except Old Tavern Road. Soon he pulled his black SUV into the lot at the tavern and parked. For a moment, he sat and stared at the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was now the General Bixby Tavern had actually been built during the American Revolution and been called the Wayfarer’s Inn. During the Civil War, it had been renamed for the gallant Union general—the kind “imaginary friend” who had, while he was alive, braved heavy artillery to save both Union and Confederate soldiers. This was when a fire had broken out in the nearby forest. While many a leader might have sat atop his horse far from the carnage, Bixby had ridden right into the inferno. Wounded after dragging at least twenty injured men from the disaster, he’d been brought to the tavern where he’d died, pleading that the nation settle its differences and find peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe really was a fine old gentleman. Dustin knew that well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe exited the car and headed up the old wooden steps to the broad porch that wrapped around the tavern. This many years later, the tavern was still basically in the wilderness—the closest town being Fredericksburg. Winter was approaching and there was a little coolness in the air, heightened by the thickness of the woods around them. Only its historic importance, and the plethora of “ghost hunters,” kept it from falling into ruin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Dustin stepped inside the dim tavern, he blinked at the change of light. He wondered instantly if the meeting had been planned so he’d have a few seconds of disorientation—a time during which he might be observed and not observe in return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs his eyes adjusted, he saw General Bixby seated at the bar. The general nodded gravely at Dustin, indicating a group across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDustin nodded in return, then moved toward the others. He saw David Caswell stand; he’d been sitting at a corner booth. Caswell wasn’t alone. There were two other men with him. One was dark-haired with Native American ancestry apparent in a strong face. The other was light-skinned and light-haired. When they, too, stood to meet him, he saw that they were both tall and fit. And both were wearing casual suits. Not the usual feds—if that was what they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dustin!” David Caswell said. The pleasure of his greeting seemed sincere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good to see you,” Dustin greeted David, shaking his hand. He glanced at the other two men and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d like you to meet Jackson Crow and Malachi Gordon,” David turned. “Jackson, Malachi, Special Agent Dustin Blake. When I first started with the police force in Savannah, Dustin and I were partners. He’s the best—and rare in his abilities.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you for coming,” Jackson said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men took their seats again. They studied him, and he returned their stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the dark-haired man was the famous—or infamous—Jackson Crow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you like being with the feds, Mr. Blake?” Crow asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do I like it? Just fine,” Dustin said. And it was fine. He wasn’t sure what he felt about being there today, however. There’d been a time when he’d wanted nothing more than to be assigned to one of Crow’s “special” units. Now...he wasn’t so sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn all honesty—and he didn’t know if it was simply self-assurance or something less commendable—he’d expected to receive a good assignment when he’d graduated from the academy. Whatever that might be. And he’d gotten a good assignment. He worked with a group of four consultants sent on diverse cases when violent crime crossed state lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You enjoy working with your team?” Crow asked. Was it just a polite question?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I do. My coworkers are good, savvy, personable and experienced. I work with one guy, Grant Shelby, who’s six foot seven, nearly three hundred pounds of lean, mean muscle, with almost computer-powered intelligence. He’s pretty good to have around in a hostile situation. And Cindy Greenstreet had the highest test scores in the past decade. I also work with Jerry Gunter—you might have heard the name. He used to be a mixed-martial-arts champ before entering the academy. He’s pretty good to have around in a pinch, as well. If you’ve called me here, I’m sure you’ve read up on me, so you know that when I joined the bureau, I didn’t start out as a kid but came in with a lot of experience, both in combat and law enforcement.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrow nodded and Dustin realized that he’d known all this. Dustin’s FBI unit was smart and tough—they’d been put together to get in and get the job done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good assignment,” Crow said with a nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.” As he’d told them, Dustin hadn’t come into the academy as a fresh-faced twenty-something grad. Before he’d gone to college, he’d participated as a witness in a case involving a duo of oddly matched serial killers. From there, he’d gone into the military, and after the marines he’d gone into police work. He hadn’t exactly entered the department immediately; there’d been a year when he’d been in total denial about himself and his “unusual” abilities—and about the heinous things men seemed willing to do to their fellows. He’d more or less walked into the wilderness. Actually, it hadn’t been that dramatic. He’d taken a job as a forest ranger in the Everglades—except that he’d been led to bodies in giant oilcans and he’d realized it was time to move his efforts in the best possible direction. There were certain things a man couldn’t escape—and his own nature was one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he’d decided to apply to the academy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know all about me,” Dustin said. “Why are we meeting?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavid looked at Jackson Crow and shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you know about the Krewes?” This time, it was Malachi Gordon who spoke. Dustin knew his name; he was a recent graduate of the academy. He’d come into the bureau after working a case in Savannah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDustin leaned back. “I’ve read about what happened in Savannah,” he told Malachi. “You know I worked with David so, of course, the beautiful city of Savannah is near and dear to my heart. In fact, I was somewhat surprised that my unit wasn’t assigned to that case, but apparently, things were already being taken care of. And, to the best of my knowledge, that case has been cleared, the paperwork wrapped up and the feds are long gone from Savannah. Having worked there, I thought I might be of some help, but...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused and grinned sheepishly at David. “It seems like you all did just fine without me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure you would’ve been an asset,” Malachi murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDustin looked curiously at the other man. “Thanks, but as I said—seems like you had it covered.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was then—and we did have it covered. However, although the Krewes are growing, there are never enough of us, and we’re always looking for the right people,” Crow told him. “Would you be interested in seeing how you work out with one of our units?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDustin smiled. That was straightforward. “I initially asked about applying to one of your units. They told me there was no application process. You formed your own units.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s true,” Crow said. “And I wish I’d known about you earlier. David was talking to Malachi about you, and then Malachi talked to me. So, yes, I looked you up and pulled strings to get all the information I could on you. Thus far, each recruit has worked out. We’re...careful in the people we approach. We have to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because you all have special talents, I take it?” Dustin asked. “And, of course, because all the other agents like to call the units ghost hunters and rib you all about it. But really, they’re all envious of your record.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Detective Caswell has told us that working with you was like—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like working with me,” Malachi Gordon cut in. “David and I were together in New Orleans,” he explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see,” Dustin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you a candidate, Mr. Blake?” Crow asked him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-is-forever-krewe-of-hunters-11/page-2.html","bookId":2285,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:49:43 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:49:43 PM"}
