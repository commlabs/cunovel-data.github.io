All I can do is decide if I trust Marcus or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd while he has done cruel, evil things, our society is not divided into “good” and “bad.” Cruelty does not make a person dishonest, the same way bravery does not make a person kind. Marcus is not good or bad, but both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, he is probably more bad than good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that doesn’t mean he’s lying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the street ahead of me, I see the orange glow of fire. Alarmed, I walk faster, and see that the fire rises from large, man-sized metal bowls set up on the sidewalks. The Dauntless and the factionless have gathered between them, a narrow divide separating one group from the other. And before them stand Evelyn, Harrison, Tori, and Tobias.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spot Christina, Uriah, Lynn, Zeke, and Shauna on the right side of the cluster of Dauntless, and stand with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’ve you been?” Christina says. “We looked all over for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I went for a walk. What’s going on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re finally going to tell us the attack plan,” says Uriah, looking eager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvelyn lifts her hands, palms out, and the factionless fall silent. They are better trained than the Dauntless, whose voices take thirty seconds to peter out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The past few weeks, we have been developing a plan to fight the Erudite,” Evelyn says, her low voice carrying easily. “And now that we have finished, we would like to share it with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvelyn nods at Tori, who takes over. “Our strategy is not pointed, but broad. There is no way to know who among the Erudite supports Jeanine and who does not. It is therefore safer to assume that all those who do not support her have already vacated Erudite headquarters.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We all know that Erudite’s power lies not in its people but in its information,” says Evelyn. “As long as they still possess that information, we will never be free of them, especially while large numbers of us are wired for simulations. They have used information to control us and keep us under their thumb for far too long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shout, beginning among the factionless and spreading to the Dauntless, rises up from the crowd like we are all parts of one organism, following the commands of a single brain. But I am not sure what I think, or how I feel. There is a part of me that is shouting, too—clamoring for the destruction of every single Erudite and all that they hold dear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at Tobias. His expression is neutral, and he stands behind the glow of firelight, where he is difficult to see. I wonder what he thinks of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am sorry to tell you that those of you who were shot with simulation transmitters will have to remain here,” says Tori, “or you can be activated as a weapon of Erudite at any time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a few cries of protest, but no one seems all that surprised. They know too well what Jeanine can do with simulations, maybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLynn groans and looks at Uriah. “We have to stay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have to stay,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You got shot too,” she says. “I saw it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Divergent, remember?” he says. Lynn rolls her eyes, and he hurries on, probably to avoid hearing Lynn’s Divergent conspiracy theory again. “Anyway, I bet you no one checks, and what are the odds she’ll activate you, specifically, if she knows everyone else with simulation transmitters is staying behind?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLynn frowns, considering this. But she looks more cheerful—as cheerful as Lynn gets, anyway—as Tori begins speaking again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The rest of us will divide into groups of mixed factionless and Dauntless,” says Tori. “A single, large group will attempt to penetrate Erudite headquarters and work its way up through the building, cleansing it of Erudite’s influence. Several other, smaller groups will proceed immediately to the higher levels of the building to dispense with certain key Erudite officials. You will receive your group assignments later this evening.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The attack will occur in three days’ time,” says Evelyn. “Prepare yourselves. This will be dangerous and difficult. But the factionless are familiar with difficulty—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this the factionless cheer, and I am reminded that we, the Dauntless, are the same people who, just a few weeks ago, were criticizing Abnegation for giving the factionless food and other necessary items. How was that so easy to forget?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the Dauntless are familiar with danger—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone around me punches the air with their fists and screams. I feel their voices inside my head, and the burn of triumph in my chest that makes me want to join them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvelyn’s expression is too empty for someone giving an impassioned speech. Her face looks like a mask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Down with Erudite!” Tori yells, and everyone repeats her, all voices joining together, regardless of faction. We share a common enemy, but does that make us friends?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI notice that Tobias does not join in the chant, and neither does Christina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This doesn’t feel right,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean?” Lynn says as the voices rise around us. “Don’t you remember what they did to us? Put our minds under a simulation and forced us to shoot people without even knowing it? Murdered every single Abnegation leader?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” says Christina. “It’s just . . . Invading a faction’s headquarters and killing everyone, isn’t that what the Erudite just did to Abnegation?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is different. This is not an attack out of nowhere, unprovoked,” says Lynn, scowling at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” Christina says. “Yeah, I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks at me. I don’t say anything. She has a point—it doesn’t feel right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk toward the Eaton house in search of silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open the front door and climb the stairs. When I reach Tobias’s old room, I sit on the bed and look out the window, where factionless and Dauntless are gathered around the fires, laughing and talking. But they aren’t mixed together; there is still an uneasy divide between them, factionless on one side and Dauntless on the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watch Lynn, Uriah, and Christina by one of the fires. Uriah snatches at the flames, too quickly to be burned. His smile looks more like a grimace, twisted as it is by grief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few minutes I hear footsteps on the stairs, and Tobias comes into the room, slipping off his shoes by the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s wrong?” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing, really,” I say. “I was just thinking, I’m surprised the factionless agreed to work with Dauntless so easily. It’s not like the Dauntless were ever kind to them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stands beside me at the window and leans into the frame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not a natural alliance, is it,” he says. “But we have the same goal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right now. But what happens when the goals change? The factionless want to get rid of factions, and the Dauntless don’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTobias presses his mouth into a line. I suddenly remember Marcus and Johanna, walking together through the orchard—Marcus wore the same expression when he was keeping something from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid Tobias get that expression from his father? Or does it mean something different?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re in my group,” he says. “During the attack. I hope you don’t mind. We’re supposed to lead the way to the control rooms.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe attack. If I participate in the attack, I can’t go after the information Jeanine stole from Abnegation. I have to choose one or the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTobias said that dealing with Erudite was more important than finding out the truth. And if he had not promised the factionless control over all of Erudite’s data, he might have been right. But he left me no choice. I have to help Marcus, if there is even a chance that he is telling the truth. I have to work against the people I love best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd right now, I have to lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI twist my fingers together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I still can’t fire a gun.” I look up at him. “And after what happened in Erudite headquarters . . .” I clear my throat. “Risking my life doesn’t seem so appealing anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tris.” He brushes my cheek with his fingertips. “You don’t have to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want to seem like a coward.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey.” His fingers fit beneath my jaw. They are cool against my skin. He looks sternly at me. “You have done more for this faction than any other person. You . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs, and touches his forehead to mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re the bravest person I’ve ever met. Stay here. Let yourself mend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kisses me, and I feel like I am crumbling again, beginning with the deepest parts of me. He thinks I will be here, but I will be working against him, working with the father he despises. This lie—this lie is the worst I have ever told. I will never be able to take it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we part, I am afraid he will hear my breaths shake, so I turn toward the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER THIRTY-NINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“OH YEAH. YOU totally look like a banjo-strumming softie,” says Christina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Not at all, actually. Just . . . let me fix it, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rummages in her bag for a few seconds and pulls out a small box. In it are different-sized tubes and containers that I recognize as makeup, but wouldn’t know what to do with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are in my parents’ house. It was the only place I could think of to go to get ready. Christina has no reservations about poking around—she already discovered two textbooks wedged between the dresser and the wall, evidence of Caleb’s Erudite leanings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me get this straight. So you left the Dauntless compound to get ready for war . . . and took your makeup bag with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep. Figured it would be harder for anyone to shoot me if they saw how devastatingly attractive I was,” she says, arching an eyebrow. “Hold still.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe takes the cap off a black tube about the size of one of my fingers, revealing a red stick. Lipstick, obviously. She touches it to my mouth and dabs it until my lips are covered in color. I can see it when I purse them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Has anyone ever talked to you about the miracle of eyebrow tweezing?” she says, holding up a pair of tweezers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get those away from me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine.” She sighs. “I would take out the blush, but I’m pretty sure it’s not the right color for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shocking, considering we’re so similar in skin tone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ha-ha,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time we leave, I have red lips and curled eyelashes, and I’m wearing a bright red dress. And there’s a knife strapped to the inside of my knee. This all makes perfect sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s Marcus, Destroyer of Lives, going to meet us?” Christina says. She wears Amity yellow instead of red, and it glows against her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh. “Behind Abnegation headquarters.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walk down the sidewalk in the dark. All the others should be eating dinner now—I made sure of that—but in case we run into someone, we wear black jackets to conceal most of our Amity clothing. I hop over a crack in the cement out of habit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are you two going?” Peter’s voice says. I look over my shoulder. He’s standing on the sidewalk behind us. I wonder how long he’s been there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why aren’t you with your attack group, eating dinner?” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t have one.” He taps the arm I shot. “I’m injured.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah right, you are!” says Christina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I don’t want to go to battle with a bunch of factionless,” he says, his green eyes glinting. “So I’m going to stay here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like a coward,” says Christina, her lip curled in disgust. “Let everyone else clean up the mess for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep!” he says with a kind of malicious cheer. He claps his hands. “Have fun dying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crosses the street, whistling, and walks in the other direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, we distracted him,” she says. “He didn’t ask where we were going again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. Good.” I clear my throat. “So, this plan. It’s kind of stupid, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not . . . stupid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, come on. Trusting Marcus is stupid. Trying to get past the Dauntless at the fence is stupid. Going against the Dauntless and factionless is stupid. All three combined is . . . a different kind of stupid formerly unheard of by humankind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Unfortunately it’s also the best plan we have,” she points out. “If we want everyone to know the truth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI trusted Christina to take up this mission when I thought I would die, so it seemed stupid not to trust her now. I was worried she wouldn’t want to come with me, but I forgot where Christina came from: Candor, where the pursuit of truth is more important than anything else. She may be Dauntless now, but if there’s one thing I’ve learned through all this, it’s that we never leave our old factions behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So this is where you grew up. Did you like it here?” She frowns. “I guess you couldn’t have, if you wanted to leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun inches toward the horizon as we walk. I never used to like evening light because it made everything in the Abnegation sector look more monochromatic than it already is, but now I find the unchanging gray comforting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I liked some things and hated some things,” I say. “And there were some things I didn’t know I had until I lost them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe reach Abnegation headquarters, and its face is just a cement square like everything else in the Abnegation sector. I would love to walk into the meeting room and breathe the smell of old wood, but we don’t have time. We slip into the alley next to the building and walk to the back, where Marcus told me he would be waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA powder-blue pickup truck waits there, its engine running. Marcus is behind the wheel. I let Christina walk ahead of me so that she can be the one to slide into the middle. I don’t want to sit close to him if I can help it. I feel like hating him while I work with him lessens my betrayal of Tobias somehow. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/insurgent-divergent-2/page-35.html","bookId":1699,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:19 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:19 AM"}
