{"id":95648,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe gavel fell, and Ben McCarthy was free. Mira, that was fast, Lucia thought, stunned. She\u0027d been expecting...something else. A bit more theater, perhaps; at the very least a token few questions or some fussiness from one attorney or the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe prosecutor looked pale and drawn in the early morning hour, squinting against the harsh overhead lights. She was a hard-looking woman, with dark hair and a fashion sense that tended toward square-cut shoulders and block skirts with sensible shoes. No doubt she won a lot of cases, but it wasn\u0027t on style points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia didn\u0027t begrudge her the lemon-sucking expression, considering how humiliating it was to have to publicly acknowledge a prosecutorial mistake of this magnitude. This had been a gigantic miss for the cops and the district attorney\u0027s office. A murderer had gone free, and a cop - not a good cop, granted - had been wrongly accused and convicted. McCarthy\u0027s life was over, professionally speaking; he was damn lucky that it wasn\u0027t over in every sense. The time he\u0027d spent behind bars had been hazardous. He had the mended bones to prove it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the gavel hit wood, McCarthy turned to look over the sparse crowd in the courtroom. Looking for Jazz Callender, Lucia knew, because he and Jazz had always been close, and it was reasonable to expect her to be present for his exoneration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Jazz would have been, if not for a conspiracy between Lucia and Jazz\u0027s beau, James Borden, to keep her safe at home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe judge rose in a flutter of black robes and escaped back to his chambers. Apart from the usual complement of guards and court stenographers, there was the sour-faced prosecutor, the cheery defense attorney, Ben McCarthy -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;somehow still neat and striking even in a prison-issue jacket - three bleary-eyed reporters...and a man sitting two rows ahead of Lucia, hunched forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcCarthy\u0027s eyes gave up the search for Jazz and fastened on her, and Lucia felt an undeniable surge of...something. Not a handsome man, McCarthy, not in any sense she could name, but there was something about him that was compelling. Clear blue eyes in an expressive face, a force of personality that could freeze you solid or melt you to syrup, depending on his mood - she\u0027d learned that quickly, during their prison interviews. He wasn\u0027t tall - in fact, in heels she probably topped him by an inch - but he was strong, and there was something graceful about him. The way he moved. The deft, neat hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw the flash of disappointment. But the flash was only that, and then he smiled at her - a warm smite - and nodded his head. This wasn\u0027t unusual; men smiled at Lucia Garza a lot. She was beautiful, and she was a careful steward of the gift; she took pains with her hair, her makeup and her clothing, and she stayed in shape. She was used to male attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd still that smile made her go entirely too warm in secret places. They\u0027d gotten to know each other well these last few weeks, while Jazz was recovering from being shot, and Lucia assumed the primary investigator spot for McCarthy\u0027s case. It had started cautiously, but Lucia, much to her surprise, hadn\u0027t found McCarthy the typical closed-off cop nor the equally typical closed-off prison burnout. He\u0027d been...interesting. Literate and smart and cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had, in fact, interviewed him more than was strictly necessary, professionally speaking. Fifteen visits in all, two with Jazz, the rest without. He had remarked, the last time, that it had been the best interrogation of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d subsequently spent more than a few hours wondering why Jazz had never succumbed to temptation with McCarthy. But Jazz had assured her - the third time loudly and profanely - that she\u0027d never slept with him, and never really been tempted. They just hadn\u0027t clicked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhereas Lucia seemed to be clicking with him like a castanet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood up and willed herself to keep it cool and professional. She edged down the row to the central aisle. McCarthy stopped to exchange some words and a backslap and handshake with his attorney, then a not-very-cordial look with the prosecutor as she snapped her briefcase closed. No handshakes necessary on that one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned toward Lucia, and took two steps in her direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone came between them. A man, tan suit, rounded shoulders, wire-tight body language. Lucia scanned him instantly with the unerring instincts of someone who\u0027d spent sweaty months in counterterrorism training; the man spelled trouble, even from the back. He wore a cheap summer-weight suit coat with a grubby look, as if he\u0027d worn it for months at a time. Even from ten steps back, Lucia had the unmistakable impression that he needed a shower. He wasn\u0027t much taller than McCarthy, and a great deal more nervous; from behind him, Lucia could see the jangles and twitches in his arms and legs. Emotion, possibly, or drugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"McCarthy,\" she heard him rasp, in a voice like silk ripping on wire. \"You son of a bitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen McCarthy\u0027s face went still, the blue eyes opaque. He shot one fast glance at her over the man\u0027s shoulder and then focused on his opponent\u0027s face. McCarthy stayed still, a total contrast to the man facing him, who had tension vibrating through every muscle. Lucia could feel it like an electrical field as she moved steadily forward. She had her weight poised, in case she needed to move fast, and she focused in on the balance points that were her targets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t have a gun - a wholly unusual circumstance for her - but that wasn\u0027t an issue. Neither did the man facing down McCarthy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stewart,\" McCarthy said. \"Hey. Thanks for coming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKen Stewart. Kansas City Police Department, Detective First Class. Lucia let the adrenaline course a little faster, let her heart rev up another couple of beats per minute. Stewart was, at best, unpredictable. At worst...Jazz\u0027s bitter assessment came back vividly: He\u0027s got the winning personality of a rottweiler raised by wolves. He\u0027d always struck her as volatile, but now she was convinced he was a Molotov cocktail in search of a lit match.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I\u0027m here to smile and kiss your feet like these other assholes?\" Stewart asked, and took another step into McCarthy\u0027s space. McCarthy didn\u0027t back away. He tilted his head a few degrees to continue to stare into the other man\u0027s eyes. \"You hear me? I\u0027m not letting you just walk away from a mass murder, you bastard. If it\u0027s the last thing I do, I\u0027m going to make you pay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcCarthy said nothing for a few seconds, then glanced at Lucia. \"Detective Ken Stewart,\" he said, calmly and steadily, \"meet Lucia Garza. Since she\u0027s a witness to you threatening me, you should probably be formally introduced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, we\u0027ve met,\" Lucia said crisply, as Stewart turned around to look at her. He had blue eyes, too. Crazy ones, shallow as glass. His skin looked pasty, unpleasantly shiny, and his hair stuck up in greasy spikes. Very unattractive indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried the crazy-eye with her. She stared back, a faint smile on her lips, until he whipped back around to McCarthy and muttered something under his breath, then pushed past to talk to the prosecutor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was comforting to see that the prosecutor didn\u0027t look any happier to see him, especially when she entered ground zero of his body odor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcCarthy took a deep breath, let the coldness fade from his face, and said, \"Sorry about that.\" He came the last few steps to join her, but his attention was still on the other man, who was haranguing the prosecutor in a low, furious voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem. It isn\u0027t the first time Detective Stewart and I have locked horns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No?\" That got his attention, with a vengeance. He was wearing a blue sport coat that was too large for him, blue jeans that were perfectly acceptable, and a plain, open-collar shirt. No tie. Relaxed for a court appearance, but then he\u0027d been there to get out of jail, not to try to avoid going in. He smelled of a particularly cheap aftershave and an underlying astringent scent that was probably prison-issue, as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s made a run at Jazz a few times,\" Lucia murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen started walking toward the courthouse doors. She kept pace. \"Bet she handed him his nuts on a platter,\" he chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia grinned. \"I don\u0027t think she bothered with the platter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, she\u0027s not much in the kitchen. So...where is she? I admit, I kind of expected to see her...\" McCarthy opened one of the doors and stepped aside to let Lucia pass. She glanced at him, but there wasn\u0027t any calculation in his eyes. It was automatic gentility. He wasn\u0027t even aware of doing it. She suppressed another smile as she thought of how little gestures like that would have chafed on Jazz. She liked her independence and saw every common courtesy as an infringement upon it. Jazz should have been born in the Old West, where she could have made a living on the frontier, riding rough, drinking hard and swearing at the top of her lungs. Calamity Jazz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcCarthy was fishing for an answer to a question he hadn\u0027t asked. Lucia obliged. \"Truthfully? Borden and I kept her away. We didn\u0027t want her presenting a clear target.\" James Borden had volunteered to keep her distracted - not exactly a sacrifice; the man had been madly in love with her for almost a year - and the significant lack of Jazz\u0027s presence this morning might mean that they\u0027d finally tipped over from flirting to...something more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr alternatively, knowing Jazz, it could mean she\u0027d had a massive fight with Borden, gotten drunk, belligerent, taken on a motorcycle gang in a fistfight, and was celebrating her victory with a hospital visit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcCarthy looked somber. \"She okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure.\" Again, a little white lie. Jazz was all right in one sense, in that the past few months had made a huge change in her life. Since the day Jazz had been given her first red envelope - the same day that Lucia, halfway across the country, had received one - her life had begun an uphill climb, after the downhill express she\u0027d taken following McCarthy\u0027s arrest. But the offer Lucia and Jazz had jointly received - to open a new detective agency with funding from a rich but highly secretive donor organization - had come with trip wires attached, and Jazz had been a casualty. When they\u0027d followed the last lead, from instructions in one of those damn red letters from the Cross Society, she\u0027d nearly died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia had no idea how much of that Jazz had shared with her former partner. Knowing her, probably little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo new envelopes had arrived recently. Lucia allowed herself to think that perhaps, just perhaps, the insanity was over. A faint hope, but she refused to abandon it just yet. All of this unexplainable conspiracy-theory stuff was just too odd to live with for long, if you expected to have a firm grip on reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcCarthy had noted her brief mental detour. \"Somebody\u0027s still gunning for her, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you say that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned, a flash of humor that lit his eyes like sunlight. \"Hell, you tell me. You\u0027re the one who kept her out of the courtroom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, somebody was gunning for her. Are they still?\" Lucia shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know. But I prefer to be careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good plan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey moved out into the hall, and he suddenly stopped walking. She looked back at him with eyebrows raised. He surveyed the corridor, the people coming and going as the day began to come alive. The glow of dawn outside the courthouse windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes had a wet shine to them. Tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"McCarthy?\" she asked gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took in a breath. \"Yeah. Freedom. Kind of took me by surprise,\" he said. \"Give me a second.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take your time,\" she murmured. She knew how it felt. There had been a dark time in her life - pitch-black, in fact - when she hadn\u0027t been sure she\u0027d ever see daylight again. The emotional impact of realizing that the trauma was over, that you were free...it could be overwhelming. It wasn\u0027t relief. It was terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you get used to the dark, the light can burn you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked, and smiled slightly. \"Sorry,\" he said, and cleared his throat. \"So. Want to have breakfast with an ex-con? I mean, it\u0027s not like we\u0027re not acquainted already. Fifteen hours of interviews has to count for something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, second and third dates, most likely. She cleared her own throat, banishing the thought. \"I\u0027d love to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got to confess, I\u0027m low on funds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They confiscated your ill-gotten gains?\" She made it an ironic question, not quite accusatory. He met her eyes without shame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I asked them to,\" he said. \"Wanted to start out fresh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah. My treat, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe offered her the crook of his elbow. She put a hand in it, and they resumed their walk down the long paneled hallway, to the free world. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-due-red-letter-days-2/page-2.html","bookId":2311,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:16:31 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:16:31 PM"}
