Julia is going\n\u003cbr\u003e to stay at home with her family, but Sallie and I are going to stop\n\u003cbr\u003e at the Martha Washington Hotel. Did you ever hear of anything\n\u003cbr\u003e so exciting? I\u0027ve never been in a hotel in my life, nor in a theatre;\n\u003cbr\u003e except once when the Catholic Church had a festival and invited\n\u003cbr\u003e the orphans, but that wasn\u0027t a real play and it doesn\u0027t count.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And what do you think we\u0027re going to see? Hamlet.
