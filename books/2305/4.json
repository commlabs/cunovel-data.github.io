She couldn\u0027t imagine anything so awful as being shut up in a hole in the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePractically buried alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, in need of a diversion, she begged her mother to let Magny spend the night. Her mother was usually reluctant, but this time she agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlynne was sure it was only because her mother and father were going to be away at a counsel meeting most of the evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up when Magny tossed the book she\u0027d been reading aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that was dull,\" Magny exclaimed. \"What shall we do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlynne yawned. \"I\u0027m tired. I was thinking of going to bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bed! But it\u0027s still early. And your parents won\u0027t be home for hours. We can\u0027t go to bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlynne rolled over onto her stomach. \"Well, what do you want to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagny bounced off the mattress, her eyes sparkling with mischief. \"How brave are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not, Mag, you know that, so whatever you\u0027re planning, just forget it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honestly, Ashlynne, you lead the most dull, boring life of anyone I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to argue, but she couldn\u0027t. It was true. Her life was boring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoutine. Regimented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Lynnie, you know you\u0027re dying to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, Magny, what am I dying to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go swimming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s so daring about that? I swim all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the ocean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlynne\u0027s eyes widened. \"You want to go swimming down there now? Tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagny nodded vigorously. \"The moons are full. It\u0027s a beautiful night. The water won\u0027t be too cold. Come on, let\u0027s do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlynne bit down on her lower lip, her better judgment warring with the desire to do something wild and crazy. \"All right. You can wear one of my bathing suits. Do you want the red or the yellow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither, silly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t mean��?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagny grinned. \"You\u0027ve got it. Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike two thieves in the night, they crept down the stairs. Old Carday was in the living room. She had fallen asleep watching a vid. Like two schoolgirls playing hooky, Ashlynne and Magny slipped out the front door, ran down the path and out the side gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was, indeed, a beautiful night. The twin moons hung low in the sky, bathing the landscape in a pale amber glow. Moonlight shimmered and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edanced on the water, sparkling like millions of tiny golden lights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagny dropped her towel on the sand and began to undress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure this is a good idea?\" Ashlynne glanced up and down the beach. To the right, she could see the outline of the mine; far to the left began the tree line that marked the edge of the jungle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not going to back out on me now, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlynne took a deep breath. \"No, I\u0027m not,\" she said, and before she could lose her nerve, she undressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrieked as a wave broke over her, then she dove into the water. She had never gone swimming in the ocean at night before, never gone swimming in the nude before, and it felt wonderful, deliciously wicked. She swam for several minutes, then floated on her back. Overhead, a million stars lit the sky as Brell chased Riasna. Would he ever catch her? she wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Magny,\" she exclaimed, \"this was a terrific idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course! Have I ever had any other kind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a laugh, Ashlynne dove into the water again, amazed at how different it felt to swim wearing nothing at all. She shrieked as something slippery brushed against her leg, images of sea monsters jumping into her mind, but it was only a piece of sea kelp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey swam and splashed until they were breathless, then sat on the shore, wrapped up in their towels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlynne gazed out at the dark green water, thinking how beautiful it was bathed in the moons\u0027 light, and how much she would miss this place when she was living on Trellis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Lynnie, got any adventure left in your soul?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" she asked suspiciously. \"What do you want to do now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, go visit Number Four, of course,\" Magny said with a wink and a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlynne stared at her. \"Are you crazy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" Magny replied with a wave of her hand. \"Well, do you want to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not,\" Ashlynne replied, but she was dressing as she spoke, her heart pounding, not at the very real possibility of getting caught, but at the thought of seeing Number Four again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe began to have second thoughts as they drew closer to the mine. Her father would be furious, her mother appalled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mag,\" she whispered, \"I don\u0027t think this is such a good idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure it is. Be careful, don\u0027t step in that hole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlynne followed Magny across the bridge, all her senses alert, She jumped when one or the boards creaked, the noise sounding like thunder in her ears, gave a little shriek when a night bird flew in front of her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lynnie, be quiet!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry.\" Ashlynne glanced over her shoulder. \"What if we get caught?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll just say I forgot something at home and we came down to get it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagny turned right, skirting the edge of the compound, until they drew near the squat cells that housed the prisoners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is silly,\" Ashlynne said, looking around. \"We won\u0027t be able to see him anyway. There\u0027s no light in the hut.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagny whirled around to face her. \"And just how do you know that,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLynnie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMouth agape, Ashlynne stared at her friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" Magny tapped her foot on the ground. \"I\u0027m waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I-I-I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m just guessing. I mean, do they have lights in the huts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ashlynne Myrafloures, tell me the truth! You\u0027ve been down here before, haven\u0027t you? When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t tell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was when my parents went to Partha the last time. I forgot you were gone, too, and I decided to come down for a visit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I decided as long as I was here, I\u0027d look around. I went to look in the cells, and. I saw Number Four. It was right after he was brought here. He was wounded, remember? I heard him moaning and I made Dagan open the door for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagny grinned at her. \"Dagan thinks you\u0027re pretty, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Don\u0027t be silly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on,\" Magny urged, \"what happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. He opened the door and I treated Number Four\u0027s wound and then I left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You call that nothing? Why didn\u0027t you ever tell me this before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagny laughed softly. \"I think you\u0027re a lot braver than you think you are, my Lady Myrafloures, that\u0027s what I think. Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike thieves in the night, they crept along until they reached Number Four\u0027s cell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, we\u0027re here. Can we go home now?\" Ashlynne whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not. We look inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me again why we\u0027re doing this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you think he\u0027s handsome. Go on, you go first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlynne rolled her eyes. The sooner she got this over with, the sooner they could go back home. Taking a deep breath, she stood on tiptoe and peeked in the barred opening, and found herself staring into Number Four\u0027s face, which was clearly visible in the moons\u0027 light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a gasp, she jumped back, and bumped into Magny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s awake!\" Ashlynne exclaimed, and turning on her heel, she ran for the bridge, and didn\u0027t stop running until she was on the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagny joined her a moment later. For a minute, they just stared at each other, and then Magny burst out laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not funny!\" Ashlynne said, and knew she would never forget the look of bitter despair on Number Four\u0027s face, or the way it had turned to anger when he saw her staring at him. As if he were an animal in a cage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe laughter died on Magny s lips when she saw the expression on Ashlynne\u0027s face. \"Are you crying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshlynne wiped the tears from her eyes. \"No, of course not. Can we go home now?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-captive/page-4.html","bookId":2305,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:11:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:11:40 PM"}
