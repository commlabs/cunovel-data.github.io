A few drops, and then out again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRutt swallowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other children with claws slipped past them, into the coiled Snake, each pulling out their own waterskins. But there were not enough of them. Still they went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now Badalle saw a new Snake, coming out of the sunset, and this one was of iron and chains, and she knew that she had seen it before, in her dreams. She had looked down upon this glittering serpent. Fathers and mothers, but children all. And there – I see her – that is their one mother – I see her. She comes .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople spilled out around the woman, with more waterskins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe halted close to the bearded father, her eyes on Badalle, and when she spoke it was in the language of Badalle’s dreams. ‘Fiddler, they are walking the wrong way.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aye, Adjunct.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I see only children.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Aye.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding behind this woman was another soldier. ‘But … Adjunct, who do they belong to?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned. ‘It doesn’t matter, Fist, because they now belong to us.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRutt turned to Badalle. ‘What are they saying?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They’re saying we have to go back.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy mouthed the last word. Back?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBadalle said, ‘Rutt, you did not fail. You guided the Snake, and your blind tongue flicked out and found these strangers who are strangers no longer. Rutt, you led us from death and into life. Rutt,’ she stepped close, ‘you can rest now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bearded man – whose name was Fiddler – managed to break Rutt’s fall, but both went down to their knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Adjunct took a half-step. ‘Captain? Does he live?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up after a moment. ‘If his heart still beats, Adjunct, I can neither feel nor hear it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBadalle spoke in their language. ‘He lives, Father. He has just gone away. For a time.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man Mother had called Fist, who had been standing back, now edged forward and said, ‘Child, how is it you speak Malazan? Who are you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho am I? I don’t know. I’ve never known . She met Mother’s eyes. ‘Rutt led us to you. Because you are the only ones left.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Only ones?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The only ones who will not turn away from us. You are our mother.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that the Adjunct seemed to step back, her eyes flaring as if struck to pain. And then she looked away from Badalle, who then pointed at Fiddler. ‘And he is our father, and soon he will go away and we will never see him again. It is the way of fathers.’ That thought made her sad, but she shook her head against the feeling. ‘It is just the way.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Adjunct seemed to be trembling and unable to look upon Badalle. Instead, she turned to the man beside her. ‘Fist, broach the reserve casks.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Adjunct! Look at them! Half will die before dawn!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Fist Blistig, I have given you an order.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We cannot spare any water! Not for these – these …’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Obey my command,’ said the Adjunct in a weary tone, ‘or I will have you executed. Here. Immediately.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And face open rebellion! I swear it—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiddler had straightened and now he walked to stand in front of Fist Blistig, so close that the Fist took a step back. He said nothing, only smiled, his teeth white amidst that tangle of rusty beard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnarling an oath, Blistig swung round. ‘On your heads, then.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Adjunct spoke. ‘Captains Yil and Gudd, accompany Fist Blistig.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man and a woman who had been hanging back swung round to flank Blistig as he marched back into the column.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFiddler returned to where Rutt was lying. He knelt beside the boy, settled one hand to one side of the thin face. Then he looked up at Badalle. ‘He led you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How far? How long?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. ‘Kolanse.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man blinked, looked over at the Adjunct for an instant, and then back to Badalle. ‘How many days, then, to water?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. ‘To Icarias, where there are wells … I – I can’t remember. Seven days? Ten?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Impossible,’ said someone from the crowd gathered behind the Adjunct. ‘We have a day’s supply left. Without water, three days at the most – Adjunct, we cannot make it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBadalle cocked her head. ‘Where there is no water, there is blood. Flies. Shards. Where there is no food, there are children who have died.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-245.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
