There were still hundreds of them nearby - the survivors could sense their closeness - but their interest in the vehicle and its occupants finally seemed to have dissipated. For a while the relentless banging and rocking of the motorhome had stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027So what the hell are we going to do now?\u0027 Emma asked, her voice the quietest of anxious whispers. \u0027Don\u0027t see we\u0027ve got much choice,\u0027 Michael replied, equally quietly. \u0027Those soldiers seemed to just disappear. We have to be close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir base must be here somewhere.\u0027 \u0027How are we supposed to find it? We\u0027re not exactly going to be able to get up and go walking around outside, are we?\u0027 \u0027We don\u0027t have to. We\u0027ll just wait here and...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Wait here and what? Just keep hiding on the floor with a bloody blanket over our heads? For God\u0027s sake, how are we suppose to...?\u0027 \u0027So what else do we do?\u0027 he hissed, interrupting her. \u0027Do you want me to start the engine and try and drive us out of here? Imagine what that\u0027s going to do to those bloody animals around us.\u0027 Emma didn\u0027t answer. Instead she buried her head in hands and did her best to hide all the desperate emotions she was feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot since being trapped in the attic room in the farmhouse from which they\u0027d recently fled had she felt such fear and hopelessness. Just when she thought their situation couldn\u0027t get any worse, they had taken another fall. Their options appeared to be simple and bleak - sit and wait as Michael had suggested or risk everything by trying to get away. Unable to contain her feelings, she began to sob. Instinctively Michael shuffled closer and wrapped his arm around her. \u0027We\u0027ll get out of this, you know,\u0027 he whispered, his voice softer and his face just inches from hers. \u0027Trust me. We\u0027ll find a way to...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How?\u0027 she pleaded. \u0027How can we?\u0027 Although she hadn\u0027t seen a crowd of this size for the best part of two weeks, she knew that one body would invariably attract the attention of another and, therefore, a hundred bodies would attract a thousand more. Every second that they lay still together and waited made their situation more dangerous. \u0027We\u0027ll get out of this,\u0027 he said again, doing his best to reassure her when it was obvious that he was far from sure himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I swear those soldiers are still close. Their base was always going to be difficult to find, wasn\u0027t it? They\u0027re going to have to come out into the open again sooner or later and then we\u0027ll...\u0027 \u0027I think we should just give this up as a bad idea,\u0027 Emma sighed dejectedly. She looked deep into Michael\u0027s eyes and, for a moment, considered telling him just how empty and hollow she felt. She had trusted him and he had let her down. This had been his idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d wanted to be more cautious. She felt strangely cheated, almost betrayed even. \u0027What?\u0027 he mumbled. \u0027I said we should give this up as a bad idea,\u0027 she repeated. She stopped speaking momentarily as the motorhome shook. Another body had collided with the thin metal wall a short distance from where she and Michael were sitting. That single, apparently random collision and the sound it created drew more of the obnoxious cadavers back to the vehicle. Seconds later and the air was filled with a deafening clattering again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot seeming to care anymore, Emma carried on speaking regardless. \u0027I think we should wait for a while and then just get the hell out of here. We were doing okay back at the farmhouse, weren\u0027t we? We\u0027ll find somewhere like that again, I\u0027m sure of it.\u0027 \u0027How many times have we been through this? There are millions and millions of fucking bodies staggering around this country and they\u0027re not about to start leaving us alone now, are they? And we weren\u0027t doing okay back at the farmhouse, because if we were we\u0027d still be there now, wouldn\u0027t we? Accept it, no matter where we go, no matter what we do, they\u0027re going to be snapping at our heels constantly.\u0027 \u0027Yes, but...\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But nothing. Look, I\u0027m sorry this hasn\u0027t worked out, I still think it will. I just need to stop running for a while, Em. I\u0027m tired.\u0027 \u0027And you really think these soldiers are just going to open their arms and help us?\u0027 Michael thought for a moment before answering. \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/autumn-the-city-autumn-2/page-44.html","bookId":2558,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:53:30 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:53:30 AM"}
