She was their greatest hope to lead and nurture the next generation!\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e More importantly, she was a direct descendant of the Situ Family Clan, not like Situ Luosha whose main bloodline came from the Ancient Profound Hawk Clan, and whose only relation with the Situ Family Clan was his last name.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt wasn’t an exaggeration to say that Situ Yaoyue’s value to the Asura Divine Kingdom far surpassed 2-3 Divine Sea Supreme Elders.

After Yaoyue’s Extreme Violet Domain is broken she can release it again. But that little beast Lin Lanjian should have paid a deep price to do so; his injuries must be greater than Yaoyue’s!” Situ Yaoxi said to comfort herself. Then her eyes flashed over to Lin Ming. Although the Extreme Violet Domain had been shattered, the true essence storm had greatly weakened Lin Ming’s attack, and with the addition of the Demon God Heartguard Mirror’s protection, it had reduced the lethality of Lin Ming’s attack to its lowest point.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOn the other hand, Lin Ming had to fully withstand Situ Yaoyue’s attack!

He secretly revolved the power of the Gate of Healing, allowing the energy to circulate through his meridians. A trace of pleasant coldness followed, subtly revitalizing his damaged meridians and making him much more comfortable.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the surrounding martial artists saw Lin Ming release his dual force fields again, all of them were left dumbfounded.

Lin Ming’s defensive power far surpassed her own.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSuperior endurance, faster extreme speed, and there wasn’t even the need to mention battle spirits. Situ Yaoyue discovered that besides cultivation, there was nothing in which she surpassed Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming wiped the blood from the corners of his mouth. He glanced at Situ Yaoyue’s left chest where there was a metal mirror that was faintly sparkling with black light.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Demon God Heartguard Mirror..”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was the final and most important battle, and Situ Yaoyue was also the most exceptional junior of the Asura Divine Kingdom. It was also reasonable that Situ Haotian had given her the Demon God Heartguard Mirror.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis mere foot long black mirror could not be underestimated, because in terms of pure defensive ability, it surpassed even the main armor pece!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Demon God Heartguard Mirror had to be activated by the Concept of Darkness in order for it to display its greatest strength. That just happened to be the Concept Situ Yoayue excelled at.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This is going to be a bit tricky,” Lin Ming thought aloud. That move just now was almost his strongest attack, but he could still only wound Situ Yaoyue. It simply wasn’t enough to establish his victory.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSitu Yaoyue summoned true essence to support the injury that tumbled in her chest. Because her clothing had been torn apart, the snow white skin of her right chest was exposed. Situ Yaoyue casually touched it and caused the thick darkness around her to condense on her shoulder, turning into a solid black veil.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Lanjian, if it weren’t for the Demon God Heartguard Mirror then I might have lost just now. Don’t think I’ll give you the chance to do that again!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSitu Yaoyue’s eyes turned cold and her killing intent reached the peak.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShe found it unimaginable that she was pushed to this degree by a mere peak first stage Life Destruction junior.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSitu Yaoyue gave a loud shot; the Extreme Violet Domain opened once more!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, a crazy Concept of Darkness gathered up like a tide, sweeping out in all directions.

Even though they were only a little affected by these tides, they still found their breath stop in their throat and their heartbeats turn heavy. They had no choice but to retreat again and again!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt was obvious that the current Extreme Violet Domain’s power and majesty had gone up by another level!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This is the Concept of Darkness! A darkness that covered a hundred mile radius!

While Situ Yaoyue was ordinary in strength, speed, soul force, and blood vitality, there was still one aspect in which she surpassed all other martial artists of her level. This was in her understanding of the Concepts and Laws. In this alone, she had reached an extremely high level.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Nine Furnace Crown Prince Yang Yun stood above his golden divine carriage, watching all of this happen from a distance.

Only if several sorts of dantian variations, divine bodies, and bloodlines are gathered together would that be able to be the opening prelude to the golden age I desire…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e……….\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSitu Yaoyue slanted her spear and rushed forwards, her figure fading into countless black shades in the void.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Situ Yaoyue wants to compare with speed?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the heroic young elites saw Situ Yaoyue’s form fade away, all of them were bewildered.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn terms of speed alone, if Lin Ming opened the Gate of Wonder and also used ‘Golden Roc Shattering the Void’, he would easily be considered the man with the highest max velocity underneath the Divine Sea. No one was able to challenge his position in this regard. Situ Yaoyue was strong, but wasn’t she making a mistake to compare speed?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm? Something’s wrong! After the Extreme Violet Domain fused with the Concept of Darkness, it’s as if space has become sticky!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eJust like the Concept of Fire had nine levels of Laws, the Concept of Darkness also had more than a single Law. The first Law was to devour true essence, and the second Law was to turn space viscous!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eDarkness was similar to chaos. Once darkness became thick enough, even space would become viscous. This stickiness would make all motions slower. When Lin Ming was at the King’s Cage in Polaris Tower, he had gone through the Cage of Chaos, and this current viscous black darkness that suppressed all feeling brought back vivid memories of that.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHo - !\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA hundred miles of darkness came shrouding down with overwhelming might; it was unavoidable!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming felt as if he had fallen into a black swamp. His breathing was slightly blocked, and even moving consumed more true essence. Moreover, his speed was less than 30% of its usual standard. Even his attacks were greatly weakened because of the lowered speed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What a mysterious Concept of Darkness!’\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Concept of Darkness was a Concept that surpassed the five elements.

The Demon Emperor had a very deep understanding into the Concept of Darkness and the Demon Emperor Armor also needed the Concept of Darkness in order to activate. Unfortunately, the soul fragments of the Demon Emperor that Lin Ming swallowed had been incomplete and they lacked information on this aspect.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Lanjian, now that you’ve entered my Extreme Violet Domain and my Cage of Darkness, your loss has already been decided!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Cage of Darkness was able to contain Lin Ming’s attack speed and movement speed. Situ Yaoyue could use this method to gain the advantage in movement and attack Lin Ming with absolute speed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Demon Moon Seal!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe blood red demon moon rushed out of Situ Yaoyue’s spear once more, howling into the void!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming had just fallen into the Cage of Darkness and wasn’t yet able to determine the characteristics of the Laws of Darkness.
