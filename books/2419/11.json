I put my head above water as he surfaced ten feet away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe used the automatic inflate on his BC, rose a few more inches out of the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were bloodshot, his face crawling with irritation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe paleness of his skin had not been a trick of the water. Now that the regulator was out of his mouth, I could see cruel thin lips, outlined by neatly trimmed, coarse black whiskers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Where\u0027s my mask?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pointed toward the middle of the lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to say something, stopped himself. \"That was $400 worth of equipment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m charging $200 per breath of air, which makes us even.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brought up his hand console, read the computer, let it float back under. \"I\u0027ll get the mask later. Which way did you throw it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI showed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s about a hundred and twenty feet deep, the way the shore drops off into the river channel. Thanks a lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. \"I\u0027m Garrett Navarre\u0027s brother. It was no problem, really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePena\u0027s eyes got small. \"I don\u0027t have time for this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t have time to screw with people\u0027s lives, either. But you seem to manage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePena put his mouth and nose underwater, seemed to whisper something to the fish, then raised up again. \"Maia warned me about you. She was quite irrational on the subject—claimed you could be an annoyance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m flattered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Annoy me, and you\u0027ll get hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I read about your girlfriend,\" I said. \"She must\u0027ve annoyed you pretty bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scariest thing was the millisecond delay in his face, the processing time during which Matthew Pena seemed to make a conscious choice which emotions to show me. He decided on a combination of hurt and anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have no right to speak about Adrienne. You know nothing about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know this, Pena: Maia\u0027s not protecting you this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re doing your best to jeopardize your brother\u0027s only chance at a buyout, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hated that he made me hesitate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Techsan isn\u0027t my concern,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTraces of a smile flickered across his mouth. \"Really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just here to tell you, Pena—if you had anything to do with Jimmy\u0027s murder, you will be nailed. If you decide to harass my brother with any more faxes, emails, or messwithyourmind presents, I\u0027ll become a regular at your scuba classes. I\u0027ll follow you to work every day. I will introduce myself to all your prospective clients. You will get to know me very well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked toward the shore where Maia and Dwight were both now standing—little sixinch dolls from this distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maia Lee in the flesh,\" Pena said appreciatively. \"A shame she couldn\u0027t take a friendly warning, stick with a winning team.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the one who\u0027s been warned, Matthew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he agreed easily. \"I was sorry to hear Doebler and your brother had a fallingout. Sorry your brother went off the deep end. But this is a highstakes business, Mr. Navarre. Those things happen. I\u0027ll attend the service tonight to pay my respects.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to kick back toward shore. \"I can hardly wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Mr. Navarre? If I really was the sort of person you think I am, you realize I would now make it my personal hobby to destroy you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be an expensive hobby, Matthew. Stick to scuba.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put the regulator back in his mouth. He raised his BC hose and hissed out the air from his vest, sunk below the surface, still without a mask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat he would do down there with limited vision, I had no idea, but something told me Matthew Pena was a lot more vicious than anything else he might encounter under Lake Travis. He\u0027d find his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got to the ladder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the top of the cliff, Maia Lee was waiting, looking furious. \"What were you saying earlier, Tres, about not messing up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dismantled my gear at the picnic table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight Hayes held the air tank while I detached it from my back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t recognize the suit,\" Dwight asked anxiously, \"did he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stripped off the wet suit, left two twenties under the weight belt to pay for the rental, then put my Tshirt and jeans back on over damp jockey shorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going back in there,\" Dwight decided. \"I don\u0027t care what Matthew says.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia put her hand on his shoulder. \"Dwight—think about what I said, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"I can\u0027t, Maia. He\u0027s already going to be mad enough. You don\u0027t blame me, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia gave me a cold stare, and I realized I really had screwed up. I\u0027d completely misread Maia\u0027s reasons for coming out here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I don\u0027t blame you,\" she told Dwight. \"Take care of yourself. You have my number if you change your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we walked back up the gravel path, Maia muttered a few choice curses in Mandarin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You came out to work on Dwight Hayes,\" I said. \"He\u0027s the weak link in Pena\u0027s armour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou didn\u0027t want to pressure Pena at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And by hardballing Pena, you just made Dwight more apprehensive about talking to me. Nice job, genius.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could\u0027ve told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe muttered some more curses, then trudged ahead, apparently determined to get out of scuba country as fast as she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took one last look back at Dwight Hayes, but he was paying us no attention. He was staring out over the edge of the cliff, watching the smooth scars on the water below, waiting for his boss to emerge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXeChatsReturn: sentto355226181 959416158 MailingList: list\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[email\u0026nbsp;protected]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e/* */ ? contact MyFriends \u003ca href\u003d\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class\u003d\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail\u003d\"83ecf4ede6f1c3\"\u003e[email\u0026nbsp;protected]\u003c/a\u003e echats.com DeliveredTo: mailing list\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[email\u0026nbsp;protected]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDate: Sun I I Jun 2000 8:29:180000\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[email\u0026nbsp;protected]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReplyTo:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[email\u0026nbsp;protected]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e[email\u0026nbsp;protected]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSubject: women\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s intriguing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReminds me of Adrienne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis one\u0027s apartment rises from the top of Potrero Hill, above the wine shop, between an Italian restaurant and an antiques store, on that cold stucco and asphalt hill that always smells of roasting coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhite inside—stark white. Huge windows. Hardwood floors. Not much else. You can stand at her windows at night—watch the fog pour into the valleys, the lights of downtown, the pearl necklace of the Bay Bridge. You can stand there in a thousand square feet of air and almost believe she\u0027s as cold as she lets on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have to look deep to find anything softer, anything interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer closet is a row of beige and white. Good brands, expensive fabrics—raw silk, pure linen. Running fingers through her wardrobe, you can just catch her scent—a perfume she wears too lightly to be perceptible on a single outfit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the back of her closet is a shoebox, fastened with rubber bands. Inside are her naturalization papers from 1969. She was ten years old, a cute kid, judging from the picture—but sad, looking like she was just hit and is trying real hard not to cry. There are five or six other photos—not enough for me to take one, unfortunately. Yellowing black and white shots—an old man in a traditional Asian robe. The writing on the back is in Chinese—at least I suppose that\u0027s what it was. A few other pictures of old people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there\u0027s the photo of the house. I guess you could call it a house. It looks like something from Tijuana or Zaire—a box put together from old doors and corrugated tin, clinging to the side of a rubble mound as if it had just slid there from the top. No grass, just dirt—chickens pecking at rocks. A huge mulberry tree on a hill in the back—the only thing that looks healthy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI memorized that photo. The old Chinese people didn\u0027t interest me. But places. Places are important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the photo, then I looked at the apartment—the clean white walls, the glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI understood why it had to be perfect, how she must wake up at night and imagine she is six or seven years old—rocks under her straw mat, rain dripping through cracks in the tin roof. I felt close to her, thinking about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her nightstand drawer, on the lefthand side, she keeps a gun—a Sig Sauer. I toyed with the idea of using that information, but no. The right path for her is too obvious, if it comes to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember sitting on her bed and thinking about Adrienne. This wasn\u0027t long after the night on the boat. I still had that small electric current inside, that sense that I\u0027d played it close. Too close. And it had been wonderful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI attract women like her—the ones who don\u0027t know when to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I wanted to tell her.\"I remember what it was like. I remember what happens when a woman steps into your life. And I will step into yours, instead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 10\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve never shared a quieter fortyminute drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stopped by the Driskill long enough for Maia to change. I waited in the lobby, tried not to look too stunned when Maia appeared in black—a colour she never wore, and one that looked damn good on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJimmy Doebler\u0027s memorial service was on Airport Boulevard at a small Unitarian church—a prefab BoxoGod wedged between a Taco Bell and a WhileUWait key shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked for the drivethru window on the church, didn\u0027t find one, and decided we\u0027d have to park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside, pews made a C around the altar. About forty people sat listening to the organist play her prelude—a mournful, highly spiritual rendition of \"Cheeseburger in Paradise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd looked like what you\u0027d expect at a funeral for a Parrot Head, as Buffett fans called themselves. There were scruffy men in jeans and Hawaiian shirts, ladies in tube tops and Indian print skirts—people who knew their way around a margarita machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne notable exception in the front row was W.B. Doebler—a blue pinstriped island in a sea of tropical prints. At the opposite end of the pew sat Ruby McBride in black pants and Vneck blouse, white linen jacket, pearl necklace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind her sat her biker bodyguard, Clyde Simms. Clyde had forgotten his Bizon2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethis evening, but his fashion statement still\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003equalified as lethal force—a scarlet silk suit, black dress shirt, silver bola. His blond hair fanned out around his shoulders. The World Wrestling Federation goes to a wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett sat beside a pew in the back, where his wheelchair wouldn\u0027t get in the way. He was holding note cards for his eulogy. I tried to remember the last time I\u0027d seen him in a coat and tie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext to him, at the end of the pew, sat Detective Victor Lopez. Something told me that Garrett had not been the one to pick this seating arrangement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia made a short hissing sound when she spotted Lopez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Detective,\" she said. \"Would you mind moving—perhaps to a different sanctuary?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLopez grinned, scooted over. \"That\u0027s okay, counsellor. Plenty of room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe slipped into the pew—Maia next to Lopez, me next to Garrett. Four friendly mourners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lines in Garrett\u0027s face were deep, his eyes watery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me, bent his index cards. \"Not the first adjective I\u0027d pick. No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLopez reached across Maia\u0027s lap and tapped my knee. \"Say hey, Mr. Navarre. We need to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wore jeans and a dress shirt and a beige summerweight jacket. His eyes were bloodshot, his chin shadowed in stubble. Either he hadn\u0027t been to sleep last night or he was trying to blend in with the Jimmy Doebler crowd. \"You got somebody to call the medical examiner\u0027s office for you,\" he said. \"That\u0027s a big naughty.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-devil-went-down-to-austin-tres-navarre-4/page-11.html","bookId":2419,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:21:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:21:11 PM"}
