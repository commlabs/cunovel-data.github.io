Really. Tell me all of it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere are some things which cannot be revealed, not because I do not choose to, but because in your present condition, at your present level of understand-ing, you would be unable to conceive of what is being told to you. Still, there is more which can be said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs we discussed earlier, you may do one of three things in what you call the afterlife, just as in the life you are now experiencing. You may submit to the creations of your uncontrolled thoughts, you may create your ex-perience consciously out of choice, or you may experi-ence the collective consciousness of All That Is. This last experience is called Reunification, or Rejoining the One.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShould you take the first path, most of you will not do so for very long (unlike the way you behave on Earth). This is because in the moment you don’t like what you are experiencing, you will choose to create a new and more pleasant reality, which you will do by simply stopping your negative thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBecause of this, you will never experience the “hell” of which you are so afraid, unless you choose to. Even in that case you will be “happy,” in that you will be getting what you want. (More people than you know are “happy” being “miserable.”) So you will keep experi-encing it until you don’t choose to any more.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFor most of you, the moment you even begin to ex-perience it, you will move away from it and create something new.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou can eliminate the hell in your life on Earth exactly the same way.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShould you take the second path and consciously create your experience, you will no doubt experience going “straight to heaven,” because this is what anyone who is freely choosing, and who believes in heaven, would create. If you do not believe in heaven, you will experience whatever you wish to experience—and the moment you understand that, your wishes will get bet-ter and better. And then you will believe in heaven!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShould you take the third path and submit to the creations of the collective consciousness, you will move very quickly into total acceptance, total peace, total joy, total awareness, and total love, for that is the conscious-ness of the collective. Then you will become one with the Oneness, and there will be nothing else except That Which You Are-which is All There Ever Was, until you decide that there should be something else. This is nir-vana, the “one with the Oneness” experience that many of you have had very briefly in meditation, and it is an indescribable ecstasy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAfter you experience the Oneness for an infinite time-no time, you will cease to experience it, because you cannot experience the Oneness as Oneness unless and until That Which Is Not One also exists. Under-standing this, you will create, once again, the idea and the thought of separation, or disunity.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen you will keep traveling on the Cosmic Wheel, keep going, keep circling, keep on being, forever and ever, and even forever more.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou will return to the Oneness many times—an in-finite number of times and for an infinite period each time—and you will know that you have the tools to re-turn to the Oneness at any point on the Cosmic Wheel.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou may do so now, even as you are reading this.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou may do so tomorrow, in your meditation.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou may do so at any time.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd You’ve said that we do not have to stay at the level of consciousness we’re at when we die?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo. You may move to another as quickly as you wish. Or take as much “time” as you like. If you “die” in a state of limited perspective and uncontrolled thoughts, you’ll experience whatever that state brings you, until you don’t want to anymore. Then you’ll “wake up”—become conscious-and start experienc-ing yourself creating your reality.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou’ll look back at the first stage and call it purga-tory. The second stage, when you can have anything you want with the speed of your thought, you’ll call heaven. The third stage, when you experience the bliss of the Oneness, you’ll call Nirvana.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI have one more thing I’d like to explore along these lines. It’s not about “after death,” but it is about experiences outside of the body. Can You explain those to me?

This can happen during normal dream-ing, often during meditation, and frequently in a sub-lime form while the body is in deep sleep.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDuring such an “excursion,” your soul can be any-where it wishes. Frequently, the person reporting such an experience has no after-memory of having made vo-litional decisions about this. They may experience it as “just something that happened to me.” However, noth-ing which involves an activity of the soul is nonvolitional.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHow can we be “shown” things, how can things be “re-vealed” to us, during one of these experiences, if all we are do-ing is creating as we go along? It seems to me that the only way things could be revealed to us would be if those things existed separate from us, not as part of our own creation. I need some help with this.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNothing exists separate from you, and everything is your own creation. Even your apparent lack of under-standing is your own creation; it is, literally, a figment of your imagination. You imagine that you do not know the answer to this question, and so you do not. Yet as soon as you imagine that you do, you do.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou allow yourself to do this sort of imagining so that The Process can go on.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Process?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLife. The eternal Process.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIn those moments during which you experience yourself being “revealed” to yourself—whether these are what you call out-of-body experiences, or dreams, or magic moments of wakefulness when you are greeted by crystal clarity—what has happened is that you have simply slipped into “remembering.” You are remembering what you have already created. And these rememberings can be very powerful. They can produce a personal epiphany.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOnce you’ve had such a magnificent experience, it can be very difficult to go back to “real life” in a way that blends well with what other people are calling “reality.” That is because your reality has shifted. It has become something else. It has expanded, grown. And it cannot be shrunk again. It’s like trying to get the genie back in the bottle. It can’t be done.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIs that why many people who come back from out-of-body experiences, or so-called “near-death” experiences, sometimes seem very different?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eExactly. And they are different, because now they know so much more. Yet, frequently, the further they get from such experiences, the more time that passes, the more they revert to their old behaviors, because they have again forgotten what they know.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIs there any way to “keep remembering”?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes. Act out your knowingness in every moment. Keep acting on what you know, rather than what the world of illusion is showing you. Stay with it, no matter how deceiving appearances are.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is what all masters have done, and do. They judge not by appearances, but act according to what they know.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd there is another way to remember.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCause another to remember. That which you wish for yourself, give to another.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat’s what it feels I am doing with these books.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat is exactly what you are doing. And the longer you keep on doing it, the less you will have to do it. The more you send this message to another, the less you will have to send it to your Self.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBecause my Self and the other are One, and what I give to another, I give to myself.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou see, now you are giving Me the answers. And that, of course, is how it works.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWow. I just gave God an answer. That is cool. That is really cool.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou’re telling Me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat’s what’s cool—the fact that I’m telling You.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd I will tell you this: The day will come when we will speak as One. That day will come for all people.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWell, if that day is going to come for me, I’d like to make sure I understand exactly what it is You’re saying. So I’d like to go back to something else, just one more time. I know You said this more than once, but I really want to make sure I really un-derstand it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAm I clear that, once we reach this state of Oneness which many call Nirvana—once we return to the Source—we don’t stay there? The reason I am asking this again is that this seems to run counter to my understanding of many Eastern esoteric and mystical teachings.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTo remain in the state of sublime no-thing, or One-ness with the All, would make it impossible to be there. As I’ve just explained, That Which Is cannot be, except in the space of That Which Is Not. Even the total bliss of Oneness cannot be experienced as “total bliss” unless something less than total bliss exists. So, something less than the total bliss of total Oneness had to be-and continually has to be—created.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut when we are in total bliss, when we have merged once more with the Oneness, when we have become Every-thing/No-thing, how can we even know that we exist? Since there is nothing else that we are experiencing.. . I don’t know. I don’t seem to understand this. This is one I can’t seem to get a handle on.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou are describing what I call the Divine Dilemma. This is the same dilemma God has always had—and that God solved with the creation of that which was not God (or thought it was not).\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eGod gave-and gives again, in every instant—a part of Itself to the Lesser Experience of not knowing Itself, so that the Rest of Itself can know Itself as Who and What It Really Is.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThus, “God gave His only begotten son, that you might be saved.” You see now from where this mythol-ogy has sprung.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI think that we are all God—and that we are constantly, every one of us, journeying from Knowing to Not Knowing to Know-ing again, from being to not being to being again, from Oneness to Separation to Oneness again, in a never-ending cycle. That this is the cycle of life—what You call the Cosmic Wheel.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eExactly. Precisely. That is well said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut do we all have to go back to ground zero? Do we always have to start over, completely? Go back to the beginning? Re-turn to square one? Do not pass “Go,” do not collect $200?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou do not have to do anything. Not in this lifetime, not in any other. You will have choice—always you will have free choice—to go anywhere you wish to go, do anything you wish to do, in your re-creation of the ex-perience of God. You can move to any place on the Cosmic Wheel. You may “come back” as anything you wish, or in any other dimension, reality, solar system, or civilization you choose. Some of those who have reached the place of total union with the Divine have even chosen to “come back” as enlightened masters. And, yes, some were enlightened masters when they left, and then chose to “come back” as themselves.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou must surely be aware of reports of gurus and masters who have returned to your world over and over again, manifesting in repeated appearances throughout the decades and centuries.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou have one entire religion based on such a report. It is called the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and it is based on the report of Joseph Smith that the Being calling himself Jesus returned to Earth many centuries after his apparently “final” departure, this time appearing in the United States.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo you may return to any point on the Cosmic Wheel to which it pleases you to return.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eStill, even that could be depressing. Don’t we ever get to rest? Don’t we ever get to stay in nirvana, to remain there? Are we doomed forever to this “coming and going”—this “now you see it, now you don’t” treadmill? Are we on an eternal journey to nowhere?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes. That’s the greatest truth. There is nowhere to go, nothing to do, and no one you have to “be” except exactly who you’re being right now.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe truth is that there is no journey. You are right now what you are attempting to be. You are right now where you are attempting to go.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is the master who knows this, and thus ends the struggle. And then does the master seek to assist you in ending your struggle, even as you will seek to end the struggle of others when you reach mastery.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYet this process-this Cosmic Wheel—is not a de-pressing treadmill. It is a glorious and continual reaf-firmation of the utter magnificence of God, and all life—and there is nothing depressing about that at all.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eStill seems depressing to me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLet Me see if I can change your mind. Do you like sex?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI love it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMost people do, except those with really weird ideas about it. So, what if I told you that beginning to-morrow you can have sex with every single person for whom you felt attraction and love. Would that make you happy?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWould this have to be against their will?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo. I would arrange it so that every one you wish to celebrate the human experience of love with in this way also wishes to do so with you. They would feel great at-traction and love for you.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWow! Hey—okaaay!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere’s just one condition: You have to stop be-tween each one. You can’t just go from one to the other without interruption.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYou’re telling me.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSo, in order to experience the ecstasy of this kind of physical union, you have to also experience not being united sexually with someone, if only for a while.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI think I see where you’re going.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes. Even the ecstasy would not be ecstasy were there not a time when there was no ecstasy. This is as true with spiritual ecstasy as it is with physical.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere is nothing depressing about the cycle of life, there is only joy. Simply joy and more joy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTrue masters are never less than joyful. This staying at the level of mastery is what you may now find desir-able. Then you can move in and out of the ecstasy and still be joyful always. You do not need the ecstasy to be joyful. You are joyful simply knowing that ecstasy is.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/243/627.html","bookId":36,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 2:46:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 2:46:15 AM"}
