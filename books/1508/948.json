It was pain that pierced into his marrow!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen Lin Ming said that Yang Yun had fused with the Ancient Devil’s soul and lost himself, that was the same as saying that Yang Yun had died. It was the same as saying that Yang Yun’s body was actually being occupied by someone else!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHearing these words, how could Yang Yun not become crazy. His eyes were blood red as he roared, “Shut up! I am me! I am Yang Yun! Lin Ming, stop trying to use your words to shake my spirit! You’re wasting your time!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Haha, are you feeling guilty? Are you feeling afraid? If you really believe your words, then why would you feel this? No matter what I say, the real Yang Yun would’ve remained serene without any change in his composure. But as for you, you’ve already fallen into a violent rage and turned crazy. This is because you’re no longer Yang Yun!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“In today’s battle I already discovered that your personality has completely changed. You’ve become demented, easy to anger, hysterical at all things. The Yang Yun in my mind reveals neither happiness nor anger and his mind is unfathomable, not allowing anyone to guess what’s on his mind. You’re not Yang Yun, but the result of the fusion of Yang Yun and the Ancient Devil. The real Yang Yun has already died, don’t you know that? He died the moment that he chose to fuse with the Ancient devil! As for you, who is standing in front of me, you are nothing more than a soul fused monster!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Shut up shut up shut up shut up!

In the skies, blood rained down, forming an endless waterfall of blood.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA martial artist had a limited amount of blood essence. If an ordinary martial artist were to attempt what Yang Yun was doing, they would’ve already turned into a desiccated corpse. The only reason that Yang Yun hadn’t died was because of the Great Blood Refining Art.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFacing this even more terrifying slaughter demon blood rain, Lin Ming actually loudly laughed, “Yang Yun, fusing with the Ancient Devil was your life’s greatest mistake. The current you has lost all wisdom and reasoning; you’re nothing more than a mad devil now. Your ambitions were too great, and your desires were too great. You were finally controlled by those ambitions and desires and killed yourself!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“In the future, your demonic heart will become infinite.

He had great courage, greater determination, and was an outstanding hero of his era. If there wasn’t a problem, his future achievements would’ve surpassed the Eightfall Thunder Emperor and the Sorcerer of the Southern Wilderness; he would’ve become someone equal to the Demon Emperor or even Emperor Shakya!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut what a pity. His ambitions and his desires were too great and he was devoured by them instead!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA single wrong move and the entire game ruined!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf a martial artist’s heart demon could kill them, then their desires and ambitions could also do the same!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eYang Yun roared. He was like a demon. Then, without warning, he slammed down his jaws and bit off his tongue. He slammed his chest until his ribs shattered, forcing more blood essence onto the blood sword. The blood sword in Yang Yun’s hand began to excitedly whistle, as if it were a demon that was unsealed after 100,000 years!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eYang Yun had really gone mad, without regards to the consequences; this mouthful of blood essence cost him 800-900 years of his life.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this point, Yang Yun didn’t even have a thousand years remaining. Although his fires of life were extremely vibrant, that was traded at the price of combusting his blood essence. Once his blood essence was burnt through, he would enter into the twilight of his life, all of his potential completely consumed!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eYang Yun’s lips and teeth were stained with blood and his hair was split apart. He looked like a demon that had crawled out from the blood abyss. He miserably chuckled, his laughter like the shrill and ugly cries of a banshee.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Ming, you have the life of an Emperor, so how would you know my pain? My heart is higher than the heavens and yet my life is more worthless than a sheet of paper! I was born a bastard, my mother nothing more than a mortal. She died a tragic death in the harem and her corpse was buried under some random hill! During my childhood my life was worth less than a dog. I had no talent, no resources, and even through the harem that was filled with factional strife and deceit, I still managed to survive!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“When I was 12 years old, I encountered the only lucky chance of my life, and that was the Ancient Devil. However, he was only using me. He trained me, built me up just so that I could be a chess piece to him. He even planted a spell within my body! If I wasn’t able to find a suitable vessel for him to possess, then my body would be seized instead! I endured the humiliation and pain, bearing it all in my heart. In order to train in the devil arts I suffered unimaginable pain. I consumed my blood essence and my life to advance. In order to cross the trial of passion I killed the woman I loved most in the world. In order to rid myself of heart demons I cut off all my emotions!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I’ve paid such a great price and endured so much, all in order to take back from the heavens what I have lost!

I would’ve been the one to die, don’t you know that!? If I didn’t swallow the Ancient Devil, I wouldn’t have been able to obtain its memories. If I didn’t obtain its memories, then what capital would I have to ascend to the Divine Realm and become king of everything?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Ahhhhh!

Why!?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I must kill you! I must take your secrets!

Besides a single transcendent divine might, all other cultivation methods that I gained from it aren’t necessarily any worse than those that could be provided by the Ancient Devil! While I haven’t experienced the plotting and deceit of the royal family’s harem, I also experienced a heartbreaking and dismal youth.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Betrayal of the one I loved, indifference of my clansmen. I had no resources and had to endure internal injuries, betting everything I had on my choice. After you were born you had the support of the Nine Furnace Divine Kingdom. I did not. After you showed your talent, you had unlimited resources at your disposal. I had to struggle for everything I had myself. You’re a central decision maker of the Sky Spill Continent’s greatest power, but I was only able to take my first step at a mortal martial house that is subordinate to a tiny third-grade sect.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The road of martial arts is to defy the will of the heavens to begin with! You blame the heavens for being unfair, then you might as well blame the world for not being flat. You place all the blame on your own destiny, and all you can think of is stealing the secrets of others for yourself. Your mind is dominated by your ambitions and your greed! You didn’t hesitate to sacrifice your very identity, even resorting to any sinister and cruel method that could help you achieve your goals. Because of this, you have doomed yourself to defeat and to death!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Yang Yun, the true you has already died.

This thunder dao diagram was 300 feet wide, larger than the fire dao diagram. Innumerable thunder tracings winded on the surface of the thunder dao diagram like little electric snakes. The tracings were similar to those that were on the 12 thunder dao fruits.
