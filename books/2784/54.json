She pulled open the door when Dominic knocked again, and he grinned brightly, raising his eyebrows. “Too tired to get changed last night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced down and realized she still had her clothes on from the day before. “I didn’t think about it. Why are you up early?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I’m starving! Breakfast is in order.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you want me to make you something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. “Of course not. Damn, girl, are you awake yet? Do you really think I’d drag you out of bed so you could cook? We’re going out for breakfast . . . just you and me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrossroads Diner was packed when they arrived, and much to the dismay of some waiting patrons, Dominic got a table right away. Looking through the menu, Haven ordered French toast while Dominic rattled off a list of eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, fruit, and toast. She wasn’t surprised because she was used to feeding him, but he smiled sheepishly anyway. “What can I say? I’m a growing boy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think you’re done growing, Dom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, pushing up his shirtsleeve and flexing his weak muscle. “I need fuel, though. These guns are the only ones I carry and they don’t come naturally, little sis.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little sis,” she said, echoing his words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” he said. “Someday you might make it official by marrying my shithead little brother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled at the thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress returned with their food, and the two of them ate. Despite the fact that the place was noisy, a comfortable silence surrounded their table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you ever think it would be this way?” Dominic asked after a few minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What way?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved his fork in the air, motioning all around them. “This way. Coming here, having a life, getting a family, meeting Carmine. All of it, really. Did you ever think this would happen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe contemplated his question as he took a bite of food. “My mama said I’d end up somewhere like this, but I figured I was given the life I had so the most I could do was get used to it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can relate,” Dominic said. “Did you know I was adopted?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was caught off guard. “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am. My real mom . . . well, no, Maura was my real mom in every way that counted. The woman who birthed me was raped, and out I popped.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaven’s mouth dropped open. “I was made the same way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I figured,” he said. “See, you and I aren’t that different. None of us are when it comes down to it. The only difference is my mom stumbled upon me at the right time and saved me from what could’ve been a disaster. I wonder all the time where I’d be if they hadn’t taken me in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You got lucky.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did,” he said. “You and Carmine aren’t that different, either. My brother’s a spoiled little shit—that’s why he’s picky. Everyone always catered to him. Not saying I was neglected, because I wasn’t, but Carmine received the kind of attention I never had to deal with.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What kind of attention?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Attention from, uh . . . Dad’s friends.” He glanced around to see if anyone was listening. “At my christening when I was a kid, there were about two dozen people. It was relaxed, a potluck at the house. Carmine’s christening was a few months after mine, and hundreds of people came to show their respect. It had to be catered and held in a reception hall.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaven frowned. “That’s horrible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not really,” he said. “I’m sure I was jealous then, but I don’t envy my brother. Before he could walk or talk, people were making plans for his future. I’m grateful I never had that kind of pressure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why him?” she asked. “Why not you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because he’s Dad’s son, a DeMarco, and that’s what they care about—the Italian blood.” He paused. “Or what they used to care about. I don’t know anymore. But anyway, to what I was saying. Carmine’s spoiled, but deep down he’s still a terrified little boy, trying to figure out where he belongs, just like you’re that girl looking for her place in the world. You two were searching for the same thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know,” he said. “And my mom would’ve called that fate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter leaving the diner, Dominic stopped by the Harper residence to pick up Tess. She threw a duffel bag into the back of the car and crossed her arms over her chest, her usual scowl on her face as she sat in the backseat in total silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce they reached the house, Tess thrust a shopping bag at Haven. “It’s a swimsuit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was taken aback. A gift? “Thank you, but I don’t need one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTess looked amused. “If you’re going to the lake with me, honey, you do need one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lake?” Haven asked. “What lake?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re heading down to Aurora Lake for the day,” Dominic said. “It’ll be a blast.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaven glanced at the bag. “And I’m supposed to wear this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTess nodded. “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaven went straight upstairs to her room and stripped out of her clothes, leaving them in a pile on the floor. The swimsuit was a black one-piece that tied around the neck, the bottom cut like shorts. Haven put it on and tied it the best she could, tugging at it to make sure she was covered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAurora Lake was located in a valley ten minutes south of the Durante city limits. The community of Aurora surrounded it, a few hundred residents living along the twenty-seven miles of shoreline. Although the lake was man-made, much of the land beyond the homes remained untouched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaven climbed out of the car and spotted the water in the distance. It went as far as she could see, wildly tall trees bordering it on all sides. Despite its enormity, something about the place put her at ease. Beyond the grassy lot they had parked on was tan sand, reminding her of the desert ground she’d been used to all her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Welcome to paradise . . . or as close as we get around here,” Dominic said, juggling some lounge chairs under his right arm. They headed toward the water, setting up on the sand in an area partially encased in shade. There wasn’t a cloud in sight, and the warm summer breeze felt nice on Haven’s skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDominic set out into the water while Tess stripped out of her clothes. Haven pulled hers off carefully and sat down, watching the few people who were already playing out on the lake. Someone started a game of volleyball after a few minutes, and Dominic and Tess joined the game while Haven relaxed under the sun’s rays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn’t take long for the temperature to rise, sweat trickling down Haven’s face. She grabbed a bottle of water from the cooler and took a drink when a familiar voice rang out. She coughed, gasping for air as the liquid went down her windpipe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me?” she sputtered, coming face-to-face with Nicholas. She took a deep breath that burned her chest. “What did you say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her as he plopped down in Tess’s lounge chair, kicking out his feet and getting comfortable. “I said I didn’t think Carmine would let you come down here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes narrowed. “We’ve been through this. He doesn’t tell me what to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” he said. “Then I’m surprised you would come here when he can’t. You know, because of trying to kill me and all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat hadn’t crossed her mind. “This is where you live?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicholas pointed behind them at a white two-story house about a hundred yards away. It stuck out among the others, the paint fresher. “That would be my place, so technically speaking, you’re sitting in my yard right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, well, he didn’t try to kill you,” she said. “It was a misunderstanding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed dryly. “A misunderstanding? He’s seriously clouded your judgment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, your judgment’s clouded. Carmine made mistakes, but he’s a good person. You shouldn’t sit there and pretend you’re innocent. It’s stupid! I wasn’t there and I know you’re both being ridiculous about this . . . this . . . rivalry thing. So get over yourself, because you can’t talk about him like that to me. I love him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood and stomped away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haven, wait,” Nicholas called out as she walked to the edge of the water. She heard him behind her but didn’t acknowledge him. “Look, I just have a hard time believing he cares about anyone. I don’t like the idea of him taking advantage of your situation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glared at him when he stopped beside her. “You know nothing about my situation! Carmine’s supportive of me, so how dare you judge him when he’s braver than you’ll ever be!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNicholas stared out at the lake. “So, uh . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want to talk about it,” she said. “No more about Carmine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wasn’t going to say anything about him,” he said. “I was going to ask if you were getting in the water.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t swim.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t have to swim to get your feet wet.” Nicholas pulled off his shirt and tossed it onto the sand. He took a few steps into the water, stopping to look at her when it reached his knees. “What are you waiting for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Trust me.” She let out a sharp, cynical laugh the moment the words came from his lips, and he immediately backtracked. “Okay, don’t trust me. But do you really think I’m stupid enough to let you get hurt? I told you before—you’re nice and all, but I don’t plan to die over you. And I guarantee, if you drown, they’ll kill me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaven stood there for a moment longer before taking a few steps into the lake, her bare feet sinking into the soft earth. She stopped before the water reached her waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So why is six afraid of seven?” Nicholas asked, breaking the tension with a joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held her hands on the surface of the water. “I don’t know. Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because seven, eight, nine.” He smirked. “Get it? Seven ate nine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. “I get it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you didn’t laugh. You never laugh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It wasn’t funny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let out a heavy sigh. “Why did the boy throw his toast out the window?” She shrugged. “He wanted to see the butter fly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See the butter fly?” The joke dawned on her when the words came out. “Oh, like a butterfly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, a butterfly. Why did the guy get fired from the orange juice factory?” Another shrug. “He couldn’t concentrate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like the orange juice that’s made from concentrate?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran his hands down his face. “You’re hard to crack, you know. I’ve never failed at making someone laugh before. I may as well have asked why the chicken crossed the road.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sempre-forever-1/page-54.html","bookId":2784,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:27:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:27:53 PM"}
