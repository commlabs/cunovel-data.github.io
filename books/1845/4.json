If she stammered or looked afraid, any chance she might have would be lost. She had to be bold, she told herself. Fearless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was finally ready. She kept up her chant to God to please help her get out of this, and if He wasn\u0027t in the mood to let her live any longer, then couldn\u0027t He please make her death quick? She tucked in the word painless every other second, and all of her pleas were squeezed into \"Oh Lord, Oh Lord, Oh Lord.\" In her heart she was certain God understood what she was asking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were waiting for her. She wanted to faint when she saw them. She heard several long, indrawn breaths, knew the heathens had made the sounds, and while the sight of her apparently stunned them—the looks on their faces indicated as much—such a reaction didn\u0027t make sense. They\u0027d obviously been waiting for her to appear, because they were all facing her when she walked into their lair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey weren\u0027t too many to count. Beatrice had exaggerated about their number. There were only five savages, standing in a half-circle behind her father\u0027s soldiers. Still, the five were enough to make her knees start quaking and her stomach lurch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe barely spared the outcasts more than a glance, as her first concern was for her soldiers. Harold and the others were down on their knees in the center of the clearing. Their heads were bowed, and their hands were clasped behind their backs, yet when she moved closer, she could see none of them had been tied. She looked them over to ascertain the extent of their injuries and was surprised, and relieved, to see they looked as fit as ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to force herself to look up at the outcasts again. Lord, they were a sight for future nightmares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey weren\u0027t demons, though. No, no, they were just men, she thought a little frantically. Very large men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeatrice had also called them savages, and Brenna was in full agreement with that assessment. \u0027Twas the truth it seemed to be the only thing the crazed woman had gotten right. Yes, savages. The description fit, given that they had blue paint smeared on their faces. Adorning themselves in such a strange fashion must have been part of some ancient ritual. She wondered if human sacrifice was another ritual they followed, and immediately she blocked the horrible thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir garments were also primitive, yet familiar to her. They wore muted brown and yellow and green wool plaids. Their knees were bare, and their feet were covered in elk boots, laced together with leather strips above their calves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were Scots. Could they be enemies of Laird MacNare? They were trespassing on his land now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWere they going to kill her as some sort of repayment for the sins of her future husband?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t like the idea of dying for a man she\u0027d never met, but then she really didn\u0027t like the notion of dying in any case, she reminded herself. Did the reason really matter?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy didn\u0027t they speak to her? She felt as though they\u0027d been staring at her for at least an hour, yet knew probably just a minute or two had actually passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFearless, she ordered herself. I must be fearless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh Lord, Oh Lord, Oh Lord…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am Lady Brenna.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited for someone to attack her. No one moved. And then, just as she was about to demand that they tell her their intentions and be quick about it, the Scots surprised the breath right out of her. As one, they dropped to their knees, put their hands over their hearts, and bowed their heads to her. Their united show of respect stunned her. No, no, not respect, she thought. Weren\u0027t they mocking her? God\u0027s truth, she couldn\u0027t tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited until all of them had regained their feet before trying to locate the leader so she could address him. None of them was giving her hints. The blue paint made for more confusion. Their faces were like masks with their grim expressions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe settled on the biggest of the lot, a dark-haired warrior with gray eyes. She stared directly at him, willing him to speak to her, but he didn\u0027t say a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Lord, Oh, Lord…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why won\u0027t you speak to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one she\u0027d been staring at suddenly smiled at her. \"We were waiting, mi\u0027lady,\" he explained in a deep, forceful voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned over his half-given answer. Since he\u0027d spoken in Gaelic, she decided to accommodate him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and her sisters had conquered the language at her father\u0027s nagging insistence, and she was thankful he\u0027d gotten his way. This outcast\u0027s dialect was certainly different from what she\u0027d learned, but she was still able to catch enough to understand what he was saying to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Waiting for what?\" she asked in Gaelic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Scot looked surprised. He was quick to hide his reaction by staring into the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were waiting for you to finish your prayer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My prayer?\" she asked, thoroughly confused\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You seem to have gotten stuck on the beginning, lass. Couldn\u0027t you remember the rest of it?\" another Scot asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There she goes again,\" yet another warrior whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood God Almighty, she\u0027d been praying out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was praying for patience,\" she announced with as much dignity as she could summon. \"Who are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"MacAlister\u0027s men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The name means nothing to me. Should I know him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA warrior with a rather nasty-looking scar across his brow and down one side of his nose stepped forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know our laird very well, mi\u0027lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are mistaken, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please call me by my name, mi\u0027lady. It\u0027s Owen, and I would be honored if you would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was having extreme difficulty understanding why the heathen was being so outrageously polite to her, given her horrific situation. Were they going to kill her or not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well, I shall call you Owen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warrior looked thrilled by her acquiescence, but she felt like throwing her hands up in despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Owen, are you going to kill me and my father\u0027s loyal soldiers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all seemed taken aback by her question. The one with the gray eyes answered her. \"Nay, Lady Brenna. We would never harm you. Each of us has just vowed to protect you until the day we die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other warriors quickly nodded agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were out of their minds, she decided then and there. \"Why in heaven\u0027s name would you want to protect me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because of our laird,\" Owen answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were determined to talk about their leader, which was all well and good because she really wasn\u0027t able to pay attention to a word they said now. She was overcome by blissful relief. If Gray Eyes had told her the truth, no one was going to die, and all of her fears had been for naught. Thank you, God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t about to celebrate just yet, however, because the intruders still hadn\u0027t explained why they had come here. They didn\u0027t look the sort to be paying a social call, and she knew she would have to find out their real motive before she could ever hope to figure out a way to get them to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d best stay on her guard, while she tried to get some answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you\u0027re Scots,\" she began, surprised her own voice sounded so weak. \"But exactly where in Scotland do you call home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray Eyes looked appalled. \"My name is Quinlan, mi\u0027lady, and we don\u0027t consider ourselves Scots. We\u0027re Highlanders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other men nodded their agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had just learned an interesting fact. Highlanders didn\u0027t want to let go of the old, dusty habits of their ancestors. The way these men were dressed, in such primitive attire, was an indication, and if she hadn\u0027t been so rattled, she would have realized how they felt before she\u0027d tried to address them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t imagine anyone having such a backward attitude, but she wasn\u0027t going to make them angry by telling them so. If they wanted to be savages, she certainly didn\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are Highlanders. Thank you, Quinlan, for taking the time to instruct me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe inclined his head to her. \"I would thank you, mi\u0027lady, for seeking instruction from your humble follower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let out a loud sigh of frustration. \"Please don\u0027t take offense, but I really don\u0027t want you to follow me anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren\u0027t planning to leave anytime soon, are you?\" She sounded pitiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes sparkled devilishly. \"Nay, mi\u0027lady, we aren\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really don\u0027t remember our laird?\" Owen asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would I remember him? I\u0027ve never even met the man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You asked him to marry you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are mistaken, Owen. I did no such thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, mi\u0027lady, I was told you asked him three times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three times? I asked him…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe suddenly stopped. Three times. Good God, he couldn\u0027t be talking about… She shook her head in disbelief. No, no, that was years ago, and he couldn\u0027t possibly know what she\u0027d foolishly done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly Joan knew about her plan to find a husband, and she would never have told anyone outside of the family. Brenna didn\u0027t have an actual recollection of proposing—she\u0027d been too young at the time to remember it now—but her sister had told her the story so many times, she felt as though it had happened only yesterday. Like any sister, Joan had delighted in tormenting Brenna about her outrageous behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe especially loved to linger over the part about the piglet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy Brenna had wanted to catch her own husband or steal a pig to raise as her own pet she couldn\u0027t guess now, and the only excuse she could come up with was that she had been very, very young.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It happened a long time ago, mi\u0027lady,\" Owen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey knew. How they\u0027d found out was beyond her comprehension, but then she was so rattled, she could barely think straight at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This man denied my request… didn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinlan shook his head. \"Twice he sent back his refusal, but it\u0027s our understanding you\u0027re still waiting to hear his answer to your last proposal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not waiting to hear his answer.\" Her voice was emphatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would seem to us that you are,\" Owen insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither man appeared to be teasing her. Honest to God, they looked sincere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat in thunder was she going to do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I keep waiting for you to laugh, but you aren\u0027t going to, are you, Quinlan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t bother to answer her. In fact, all of them were quite content to stand there talking to her. Their behavior was most Peculiar. These warriors didn\u0027t seem the sort to want to linger anywhere, but they were lingering now. Were they waiting for something to happen, and if so, what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna didn\u0027t like having to be patient. She had the sinking feeling she wasn\u0027t going to find out their plans until they felt like explaining, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe refused to believe they had come all this way just to remind her of a proposal she\u0027d made years ago, and they couldn\u0027t possibly expect her to honor it now. She didn\u0027t believe their nonsense about being her humble followers either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough it was probably foolhardy, she decided to catch them in their lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have said you are my humble followers. Were you telling the truth, Quinlan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe warrior looked over her head, into the forest, before he answered. He smiled too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am here to protect you and serve you, mi\u0027lady. We all are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled back. \"Then you will do as I bid you to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, then. I bid you to leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t move. She wasn\u0027t the least bit surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I cannot help but notice you\u0027re still here, Quinlan. Did you perchance misunderstand me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant looked as though he was about to laugh. He shook his head and said, \"I cannot serve you if I leave you. Surely you understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe surely didn\u0027t understand. She was about to ask him if she could leave without worry he\u0027d follow her, but Owen interrupted her with yet another reminder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mi\u0027lady, about your proposal…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we back to that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOwen nodded. \"You did ask,\" he stubbornly insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I did ask. I have since changed my mind. Is this man still alive? He must be terribly old by now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid he send you to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinlan answered. \"He did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinlan smiled at her again. The others were grinning too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s standing right behind me, isn\u0027t he?\" She thought her nervousness had kept her from hearing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery one of the heathens nodded. \"All the while?\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only just now,\" Quinlan answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was why they\u0027d all been waiting. She should have realized. If she hadn\u0027t been so busy trying to figure out a way to get them to leave, she would have considered the possibility that their leader might come along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t want to turn around, of course, but pride prevented her from trying to run. Tightening her hold on her dagger, she braced herself for what she was going to see, and finally turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, yes, he\u0027d been right behind her, all right. How could she not have known? The warrior was as tall as a pine tree. If she reached out, she could pinch him. She stared at his massive chest, suddenly too worried to look up. His size was staggering. Why, the top of her head didn\u0027t even reach his chin. He stood just a foot or two away from her, and when she took an instinctive step back, he took a step forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe really was going to have to look at his face, she told herself. He\u0027d see it as a sign of cowardice if she didn\u0027t. Trying to run away would probably give him a hint of how intimidating his size was to her, and why, oh, why, couldn\u0027t she find any gumption? She had some just a few minutes ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor was just running out of patience when she looked directly into his eyes. His own reaction surprised him. The force of her beauty made his breath catch in the back of his throat. He\u0027d thought her pretty when he was watching her by the stream, muttering to herself while she tugged on her braid to get her ribbon undone, but he hadn\u0027t taken the time to observe how truly beautiful she was. He hadn\u0027t been close enough, or curious enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman really was exquisite. He couldn\u0027t seem to stop staring at her now. The power of her beauty captivated him, and he suddenly realized he wasn\u0027t any better than his men. He\u0027d been furious when he\u0027d seen how besotted they were, and now, he admitted, he was in much the same condition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could he not have noticed such perfection? Her skin was flawless; her eyes were a clear, sparkling color of blue, and her rosy, full mouth made him want to think about all the erotic doing, he turned his gaze to her forehead so that he could regain his concentration. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-wedding-lairds-fiancees-2/page-4.html","bookId":1845,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:36:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:36:46 PM"}
