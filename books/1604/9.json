{"id":92409,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good to have patrons this early in the spring.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look around, \"How safe is the town?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugs, \"Depends. A sweet piece of virgin ass like you is going to have troubles no matter where you go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown, \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe croaks a laugh, \"Precious you are risking a fuck of a lot coming here. The hunters are looking for breeders like you. Clean virgins.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pass her a diamond ring from my pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer dark brown eyes light up, \"Luckily, a lady like me runs this Inn. You\u0027ll be safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile bitterly, \"Wait until you see the ring you get when I leave here in one piece. Virginity intact.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raises an eyebrow at me, \"I\u0027m starting to think maybe you\u0027re not too virginal. Most girls who look like you are slightly more fun to mess with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug, \"I aim to please.\" I\u0027ve read the line in a book once and always wanted to use it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe croaks again and turns away from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d sneak out in the night if I were you. The things that circle the town have what they want by sundown.\" She turns back to me and grins a bright white smile, \"Like I said, the girls that look like you are more fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI meet her smile, \"I\u0027m fun. Just not in a way anyone appreciates.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climb the stairs, trying not to let my exhaustion be too obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Eight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hand slips over my mouth. I instantly think of the germs. I squeeze my lips together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t move princess. They\u0027ve come for you. Those fuckers sold you out to the breeders. Or it was that old bitch. You should know better than to trade with the first person who talks to you. You bush people are stupid.\" Her bright white smile flashes in the darkness, \"Don\u0027t look so scared, I have a way out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. She pulls her hand from my face and puts it out in front of me. I slip my hand into my sports bra and pull out a massive ruby ring. I took it off a dead woman in a pile of rubble. It\u0027s gorgeous. It sparkles, even in the muted moonlight filtering in through the thin curtains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turns her back on me and walks to the closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opens the door. I follow her. I\u0027m holding my sack close to my chest. She pulls the rod for hanging clothes in the closet, making the wall pop out. She pushes it inside and walks into the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe enters the darkness. I put my hands out. I hear voices coming to the room. I close the wall behind me, shutting them out and me in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel her hand grip mine suddenly. I want to scream but I don’t. My pulse is vibrating throughout my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWords are whispered into the darkness. \"Stairs.\" I put my feet down to the next level slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear men\u0027s voices above me, \"What the fuck is this?\" They sound like they\u0027re right on top of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear the old woman\u0027s voice. I feel cheated and betrayed. For trade she would sell me out. Sell me out to the farms. I know humanity is a disgusting disappointment, but I still have a hard time imagining a woman turning another woman into the farms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was here please. Let him just come home for a few days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI continue down the stairs, feeling for each step with my toes. It feels like an eternity has passed by the time I reach the bottom. The voices are gone. Replacing them is a dripping sound and dank cold air. The kind that can only be found underground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look into the darkness, \"This was your house wasn’t it?\" I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You guessed it kid. My husband had this installed when we built the house. He worked for the CIA.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel her hand grip mine again and pull me, \"The ground is flat. We have to hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am stunned, no one knows about her underground bunker. Not as stunned as I am that she is helping me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could have sold me to them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel her grip my fingers. Her voice has changed. \"They have no right. No right to do what they\u0027re doing.\" I feel her fingers on my shoulders biting into them. She shakes me, \"You must hurry. Don\u0027t come back here. The girls all get taken. The hunters are dressed up as traders but they\u0027re not. Run. Feel your fingers along the wall until you see light in the ceiling. Climb up there. It’s a latch. I have to get back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe is gone before I can even thank her. I am alone in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fear is crippling me. I reach a trembling hand out into the darkness. Cold hard stone meets me somewhere in the black. I run my fingers along it, running as best as I can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m scared. I hate being scared. I decide I need a rule about being scared and doing things that make me scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see the ring of light up ahead. It casts a dull beam in the shape of a circle on the floor. The morning sun is rising. I\u0027ve slept later than I thought I would have. I should have been halfway home by the time the sun came up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel like I\u0027m stepping into a magical light, like in the movies I watched with my granny. The dark of the bunker is held at bay by the tiny ring of light. Dust sparkles inside of the ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach my trembling fingers through it, making the dust dance in the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up at the ring of light. I put my hand out at the small ladder I can just see. I climb until my head is at the wooden hatch. I listen to the silence. Nothing makes a sound. I don’t want to open the hatch. I want to hide in the dark of the bunker and never come out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear a whisper on the wind. It\u0027s a sound I would know anywhere. It isn’t close to my location, but it hurts me just the same. It could be me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a breath and put my hand on the bottom of the hatch. I try to calm the shakes, but I can\u0027t. I push on the hatch. Light floods the small space even though the crack is tiny. My eyes adjust to the bright morning light. The sun hasn’t completely risen, just as the moon hasn’t fully set. It is dawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see greenery everywhere around the hatch. Moss and brush surround me. I don’t see anything but the sounds of the screams have filled up the air. The animals make no noises, as the people have taken over the space with their screams again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Puuleeease. Please. Stop please. I have money. I have riches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice scares me. The desperation frightens me. I have never been that desperate but I know I have it in me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please sir, please. Don\u0027t you have a sister or a wife that you would want kept safe. Please. I\u0027ll let you do whatever you want please just don’t take me. Don\u0027t take me back there. I will die in there. Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to rock back and forth on the ground. I wish they would just kill her so she will shut up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m frozen. I don’t leave my bunker but I don’t close the lid either. I don’t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know I\u0027m in danger. I take a deep breath. I think about Leo and Jake. I think of poor Anna alone and taking care of Jake. I feel bravery, or stupidity, for the smallest of seconds. I pull myself out of the bunker and slide along the moss and brush. I make very little noise but every movement or rustle feels as loud as a gunshot. I creep along the ground on my hands and feet like Leo does. I move away from the town. I don’t know where I am but I\u0027m scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI get to a crowded bunch of trees and bushes and decide I need to risk it and stand. I need my bearings. I take another deep breath and slide my body up along side a tree. I try to blend in. Hoards of people have gathered in the street in front of the town. I can see the field and the cement road. I\u0027m on the right side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWomen and girls are being loaded into trucks. They sob and reach for their loved ones. One girl looks about thirteen. I feel anger welling inside of me. There are the four guards from the gates and five other men milling around the trucks. The tenth man is inside the cab of the truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brain is screaming at me to help the girl. She\u0027s a kid. That won\u0027t stop them. The sweaty men who take turns. I close my eyes. I shake my head, to rearrange my thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn my back on them. I run away, like the coward I am. I run until I find the broken branches. I use them to lead myself back to my weapon stash. I breathe easier when my bow is back in my hands. I could kiss my knife. I tuck it into my boots and start the run back to the house. I run faster than I did the day before. I run with new fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003exxxx\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach the house in the middle of the night. I see Leo\u0027s eyes. He stalks to me. He sniffs me everywhere. He\u0027s checking to make sure I\u0027m okay. When I bend my knee to kiss him, I sob. He\u0027s seen this before. He knows sometimes I just need to get it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Em?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up to see Anna pointing a gun at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile and hold up the sack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lowers the gun, \"You okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod into the darkness, \"No, but it\u0027s not anything new. How is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can see her grim look in the moonlight. My stomach sinks. I want to panic and cry out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s fading fast. I was about to cut his leg off when I heard you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh and break into a run. I burst through the farm door, something I\u0027ve never done before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m pulling the needle out of the sack with one of the vials, as I kneel before him. His dark hair is matted against his sweaty face. I can see the moisture in the moonlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnna pours the vodka we found in one of the cupboards all over my hands and the needles and vial. The liquor is splashing all over me. She holds the bottle up to my lips. It burns its ways into my empty stomach. The bits of food I\u0027ve eaten are long gone. Thank god. She wipes his arm. I finish putting the vial together and stab him in the arm. I push it in slowly like my dad showed me. He doesn’t stir. He doesn\u0027t register that I\u0027m pumping his arm full of antibiotics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull the bandages off his wounds. The red lines are everywhere. I swallow hard. Anna puts the vodka back to my lips. I drink again. I pour the tea tree, she has next to the vodka, all over the wound and the blade of my knife. I slice into swollen part the injury and milk the puss from it. I pour the tea tree after I douse it in vodka. I am careful not to rupture the blood vessels and make more infection. When it\u0027s clean again and no more puss comes out. I smother it in the old tube of medical salve, the farmhouse had in the bathroom. I cover it again with a gauze bandage and tape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fever is still high. He licks his lips and looks down at me with blood shot eyes. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-born-1/page-9.html","bookId":1604,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:56:02 PM"}
