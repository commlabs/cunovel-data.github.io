He gave Alan’s body that was full of injuries a look and then said, “Let’s rest for a while until you’ve recovered, and then let’s head north.

He had a rare seventh level ability, high-speed recovery. The speed of his his injuries’ recovery was ten times that of a normal person’s. He fiddled with a medical kit while asking, “After completing this, what else will we do?

She knew that her heading north would most likely be useless. Moreover, O’Brien could resolutely use 30% defeat as a reason, but Helen couldn’t. She needed at least 70% success before even considering doing something. If she acted like O’Brien, then it might very well mean that Persephone, Su, and a few others would lose their final opportunity of retreat. That was why cool-headedness and rationality, at times, signified even greater courage.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eShe picked up a large glass of water, drinking from it as she walked towards the laboratory. A healthy body needed enough nutrients, ample rest, as well as enough water and trace elements. Helen had never refuted the fact that she was a genius, and when she was in her teens, she already made the parliament’s head biochemist Dr. Connor look bad. However, she knew that on the road to success, what one had to rely on was persistence, and persistence was dependent on their stamina; this was no exception for any genius. That was why she was constantly watching her body.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHelen made her way through the central laboratory region, and then she passed through two doors with tight security before entering the top secret biochemistry region. Upon walking into this region, the ice-cold and machine like expression on her face was immediately replaced with shock. With a loud and clear sound, the glass of water dropped onto the ground.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eRows of transparent containers were arranged in this biochemistry region, these cubic meter sized containers filled with faint green nutrient fluid. The extensive biochemistry cultivating region had close to a hundred of these containers, growing within them specimen at different maturation stages. The light screens at the entrance to this region were displaying these containers’ current conditions. Right now, there were at least a dozen containers whose conditions were a striking red on the light screen.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe containers’ lids had input, monitoring, and other devices integrated into them, making them the most frail components. On the lids of those containers that were experiencing abnormal situations were holes of varying sizes, the small ones as small as a fist, the large ones the diameter of a bowl. Even though the lids weren’t made of sturdy composite materials like the walls, they were still made of a light alloy, not something easily broken through. There was even less of a chance of it being broken through by the incomplete specimens being cultivated.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAs soon as Helen’s eyes passed through those broken holes, a strange water made its way out from the top of the container and rested on the lid. It had a long and smooth body, its black skin covered in the culture fluid. Four limbs extended from each side of its body, their ends sharp like blades and flickering with metallic luster. A long tail grew from the end of its body, and eight sharp metal stingers extended outwards from it. Even though its body wasn’t large, its trunk only around twenty centimeters in size, its power was clearly not proportional to its size. With a light stab of its eight claws, the light alloy of the cover was penetrated. It laid there steadily, its long tail still soaked within the nutrient fluid.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIt didn’t have eyes, yet it had a large mouth that made others shudder. Within its mouth was a piece of flesh from who knows what creature. This should have been a sample that was originally growing within a container, but it now only had a small half of its body left.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThe strange creature’s mouth suddenly became abnormally large, directly devouring the remaining piece of flesh. Then, it released a short and sharp cry, its body curling up into a ball.
