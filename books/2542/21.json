She should never have let him work on that crate. They should have asked Fischer to open it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about what Lionel had said before he\u0027d gone to sleep: that Florence Tanner was becoming so anxious to prove her case that she was sacrificing her bodily well-being to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dissociation of mind resulting in a modification of self is the basic cause of mediumistic phenomena,\" he had said. \"I don\u0027t know if there really was a Daniel Belasco or not, but the personality Miss Tanner claims to be in touch with is nothing more than a division of her own personality.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdith blew out a harried breath and turned onto her back. If only she could understand as Lionel did. All she could think of were those horrible teeth marks around Florence Tanner\u0027s nipples; the scratches and bites which Florence claimed the cat had inflicted. How could she have done those things to herself, even unconsciously?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdith slipped her legs across the mattress edge and sat up. She stared at her shoes for several minutes before pushing her feet into them. Standing, she moved to the octagonal table and looked at the manuscript. She ran a finger over the title page. Would it really hurt? she thought. It was ridiculous to have this almost mindless dread of alcohol. Just because her father\u0027s drinking had made her childhood miserable was no reason to condemn liquor per se. All she was contemplating was one small drink in order to relax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved to the cabinet and opened the door. Lifting out the decanter and one of the small silver cups, she carried them to the table. She pulled a tissue from her purse and cleaned out the silver cup before she poured it full of brandy. It was very dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wondered suddenly if it could be poisoned. That would be a grisly way to end things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dipped a finger into the brandy, touched it to her tongue. Would she know if it was poisoned? Her tongue began to burn, and she swallowed nervously. The warmth spread delicately to the tissues of her throat. Edith raised the silver cup and held it underneath her nostrils. The aroma was pleasing. How could it be poisoned? Surely someone had tasted it before this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a tiny sip, closing her eyes as it trickled down her throat. The inside of her mouth grew warm. She made a sound of pleasure as the brandy reached her stomach and a tiny core of heat began expanding there. She took another sip. It\u0027s what I need, she thought. I\u0027m not a potential drunk just because I sip a little brandy. She moved to the rocking chair, hesitated, then sat down. Leaning back, she closed her eyes and drank the brandy with deliberate sips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the cup was empty, she opened her eyes and looked toward the table. No, she thought. One was enough. She felt relaxed now; that was all she wanted. She held the cup before her eyes, examining the intricacies of its silverwork. Maybe she\u0027d take it home as a souvenir when the week was over. She smiled. There; that was better. She was planning ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about Fischer. She really should apologize to him for avoiding him so rudely this morning. She should thank him for saving her life. She shivered, thinking of the stagnant water in the tarn, and stood up, wavering slightly as she crossed the room. She opened the door and stepped into the corridor, closing the door behind herself as quietly as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wave of dread swept over her for an instant as she realized that she was alone for the first time since they\u0027d entered the house. She scoffed away the dread. She was being foolish. Lionel was just inside the room. Florence was probably in her room, Fischer in his. She moved along the hallway to his door. Was she making a mistake? No, she thought; I owe him an apology, I owe him thanks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knocked on Fischer\u0027s door and waited. There was no sound inside the room. After several moments she knocked again, but there was no response. Edith turned the knob and pushed at the door. What am I doing? she thought. She couldn\u0027t stop herself. Opening the door, she looked inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was considerably smaller than the one she and Lionel were in. There was only one massive bed with a high, square-cut canopy. To its right was a table with a French telephone and an ashtray on it. Edith looked at the ashtray filled with mashed cigarette butts. He smokes too much, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drifted to the armchair beside the table. Fischer\u0027s tote bag was on it, its zipper undone. Edith looked inside and saw some T-shirts and an open carton of cigarettes. She swallowed, reaching down to touch the bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whirled with a gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFischer was standing in the doorway, looking at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a terribly extended time, it seemed to her, they stared at each other. Edith\u0027s heartbeat raced; she felt a licking heat across her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it, Mrs. Barrett?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to get control of herself. What must he be thinking to find her here like this? \"I came to thank you,\" she managed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For saving my life last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drew back unconsciously as Fischer walked over to her. \"You shouldn\u0027t have left your husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t know what to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFischer looked at her closely. \"I think you should go back to your room now,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved beside her as she crossed the rug. \"Try tying your wrist to the bed at night,\" he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdith nodded as he followed her into the corridor and to her room. She turned to face him. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t leave your husband again,\" he said. \"You should never - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe broke off, leaning forward suddenly as though to kiss her. Edith twitched and drew back. \"Have you been drinking?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tightened. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it isn\u0027t safe to drink here. It isn\u0027t safe to lose control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" I am not losing control,\" she told him stiffly. She turned and went inside her room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11:16 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlorence started as someone knocked on the door. \"Come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFischer entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ben.\" She tried to rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t get up,\" he told her. He started across the room. \"I\u0027d like to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" She patted the bed. \"Sit here beside me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFischer settled on the mattress edge. \"I\u0027m sorry you\u0027re in pain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will pass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, unconvinced, then looked at her in silence, until Florence smiled. \"Yes?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe braced himself for her reaction. \"I agree with Doctor Barrett. I think you should leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Ben.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re being torn to pieces, Florence. Can\u0027t you see that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t think I\u0027m doing these things to myself, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I don\u0027t,\" he answered. \"But I don\u0027t know who is doing them, either. You say it\u0027s Daniel Belasco. What if you\u0027re wrong?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if you\u0027re being fooled?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fooled?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was a woman medium here with us in 1940. Grace Lauter. She became convinced that a pair of sisters haunted the house. She built a very convincing case for it. The only trouble was, she was wrong. She cut her throat the third day we were here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Daniel Belasco does exist. We found his body, found his ring with his initials on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We also put him to rest. Why isn\u0027t he at rest, then? \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlorence shook her head. \"I don\u0027t know.\" Her voice was faltering. \"I just don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry.\" He patted her hand. \"I\u0027m not trying to pick at you. I\u0027m just concerned, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Ben.\" After several moments she smiled at him. \"Benjamin Franklin Fischer,\" she said. \"Whoever gave you such a name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My father. He was nuts for Benjamin Franklin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing to tell. He left my mother when I was two. I don\u0027t blame him. She must have driven him mad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlorence\u0027s smile faded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was a fanatic,\" Fischer said. \"When I started showing signs of mediumship at nine, she devoted her existence to it.\" His smile was humorless. \"My existence, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you regret it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I regret it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Truly, Ben?\" She looked at him with deep concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFischer smiled abruptly. \"You said you were going to tell me about Hollywood when we settled down.\" His smile went wry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that things have settled down much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a long story, Ben.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gazed at him in silence. \"All right,\" she finally said. \"I\u0027ll tell you briefly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFischer waited, looking at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps you read about it,\" Florence said. \"The gossip columns made a lot of it at the time. Confidential even did a story on the Spiritualist meetings I held in my home. They made it sound like something else, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t, Ben. It was exactly what I claimed. As for the stories about me never marrying because I wanted to \u0027play the field,\u0027 as they called it, they weren\u0027t true either. I never married because I never met a man I wanted to marry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you become an actress?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I loved to act. When I was a child, I put on little shows for my parents and relatives. Later on, I joined the high-school drama club, a local theater group, majored in dramatics at college. The progression was remarkably smooth; it happens that way sometimes. A God-given appearance, a combination of fortunate events.\" She smiled a little ruefully. \"I was never a great success at it. I didn\u0027t apply myself enough. But there was never anything questionable, either. No dark past, no scars covering childhood wounds. I had a wonderful childhood. My parents loved me, and I loved them. They were Spiritualists; I became a Spiritualist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you an only child?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a brother. David. He died when he was seventeen - spinal meningitis.\" She looked into the past. \"It was the only real sorrow of my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled again. \"It was the \u0027waning\u0027 of my career, they said, that made me \u0027flee\u0027 from Hollywood, \u0027turning to religion\u0027 for comfort. They always neglected to mention that I\u0027d been a Spiritualist all my life. Actually, I blessed my fading career. It gave me the opportunity to do what I always knew I should do - devote myself exclusively to mediumship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t fear Hollywood - or flee from it. There\u0027s nothing fearful about it. It\u0027s a location and an enterprise, nothing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat those involved in it make of their lives is their own choice. The so-called \u0027corrupting\u0027 influences are no greater than similar influences that exist in any line of work. It isn\u0027t the business that matters, but the corruptibility of those who enter it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that I was unaware of the moral vacuum which usually surrounded me. On crowded sets, at parties, I was often overwhelmed by the atmosphere of unwholesome tension in the air.\" She smiled, remembering. \"One night, when I went to bed, I said the Lord\u0027s Prayer as I always do. Suddenly I realized that what I\u0027d said was \u0027Our Father which art in heaven, Hollywood be thy name.\u0027\" She shook her head in amusement. \"I left within the month and came East to stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFischer began to speak, then broke off as somewhere, faintly, in the distance, the cat yowled. End of pleasant interlude, he thought. Florence looked pained. \"The wretched thing.\" She started to rise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFischer pressed her back against the pillows. \"I\u0027ll look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rest.\" he told her, standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before you go, would you get my purse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFischer walked across the room and got it for her. Florence opened it and removed a medallion, holding it out to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFischer took it. There was a single word engraved on it: BELIEVE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all within you if you do,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started to hand it back to her. \"No, keep it,\" she said. \"From me to you, with love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFischer forced a smile. \"Thank you.\" He slipped the medallion into his pocket. \"I\u0027m really all right, though. Worry about yourself, not me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you sit with me after I rest?\" she asked. \"I\u0027ve got to contact Daniel Belasco, and trance is the quickest way. But I don\u0027t want to sit alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t consider leaving, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t, Ben, you know that.\" She paused. \"Will you sit with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFischer looked at her uneasily. Finally he nodded. \"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left the room without another word. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hell-house/page-21.html","bookId":2542,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:04:29 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:04:29 AM"}
