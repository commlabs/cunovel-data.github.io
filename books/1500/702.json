At that time, I had secretly sought you out, and also wept greatly, the first time I’ve ever cried. Back then, your encouragement gave me courage again, and I also learned how to make them fear me, which was to kill all who dared rebel. Meanwhile, the first one I killed, was the most powerful of the original three giants, a dark saint. When the Trials Division finally became mine, I killed even more, killing until everyone began to fear me, with even Piccolo and Mitchels going into hiding. It was because you told me that the more I killed, the safer he would feel in the future. I know that you really said that for my good, because it has already been proved that what you said was correct. Then afterwards… you brought him back to the Black Dragonriders.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003ePersephone stared fixedly into the deep night sky, as if she was looking at Su who was who knew where.

Following this somewhat childish movement, she seemed to have released a lot of her pent-up frustrations and repressed emotions. She revealed a faint smile, her smile extremely charming.
