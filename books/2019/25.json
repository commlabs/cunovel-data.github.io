He\u0027s a very democratic fellow for an Emperor and he was interested in my experiences as a First Minister in Cleon\u0027s time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It made a deep impression on us all. We haven\u0027t had an Emperor in our halls for many years. Generally, when the Emperor needs something from the Library-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can imagine. He calls for it and it is brought to him as a matter of courtesy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was once a suggestion,\" said Zenow chattily, \"that the Emperor be outfitted with a complete set of computerized equipment in his palace, hooked directly into the Library system, so that he would not need to wait for service. This was in the old days when credits were plentiful, but, you know, it was voted down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yes, almost the entire Board agreed that it would make the Emperor too much a part of the Library and that this would threaten our independence from the government.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And does this Board, which will not bend to honor an Emperor, consent to let me remain at the Library?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At the present moment, yes. There is a feeling-and I\u0027ve done my best to encourage it-that if we are not polite to a personal friend of the Emperor, the chance of a rise in appropriations will be gone altogether, so-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So credits-or even the dim prospect of credits-talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And can I bring in my colleagues?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZenow looked embarrassed. \"I\u0027m afraid not. The Emperor was seen walking only with you-not with your colleagues. I\u0027m sorry, Professor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon shrugged and a mood of deep melancholy swept over him. He had no colleague to bring in, anyhow. For some time he had hoped to locate others like Wanda and he had failed. He, too, would need funding to mount an adequate search. And he, too, had nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e13\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrantor, the capital world-city of the Galactic Empire, had changed considerably since the day Hari first stepped off the hypership from his native Helicon thirty-eight years ago. Was it the pearly haze of an old man\u0027s memory that made the Trantor of old shine so brightly in his mind\u0027s eye, Hari wondered. Or perhaps it had been the exuberance of youth-how could a young man from a provincial Outer World such as Helicon not be impressed by the gleaming towers, sparkling domes, the colorful, rushing masses of people that had seemed to swirl through Trantor, day and night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, Hari thought sadly, the walkways are nearly deserted, even in the full light of day. Roving gangs of thugs controlled various areas of the city, competing among themselves for territory. The security establishment had dwindled; those who were left had their hands full processing complaints at the central office. Of course, security officers were dispatched as emergency calls came through, but they made it to the scene only after a crime was committed-they no longer made even a pretense of protecting the citizens of Trantor. A person went out at his own risk-and a great risk it was. And yet Hari Seldon still took that risk, in the form of a daily walk, as if defying the forces that were destroying his beloved Empire to destroy him as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so Hari Seldon walked along, limping-and thoughtful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing worked. Nothing. He had been unable to isolate the genetic pattern that set Wanda apart-and without that, he was unable to locate others like her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWanda\u0027s ability to read minds had sharpened considerably in the six years since she had identified the flaw in Yugo Amaryl\u0027s Prime Radiant. Wanda was special in more ways than one. It was as if, once she realized that her mental ability set her apart from other people, she was determined to understand it, to harness its energy, to direct it. As she had progressed through her teen years, she had matured, throwing off the girlish giggles that had so endeared her to Hari, at the same time becoming even dearer to him in her determination to help him in his work with the powers of her \"gift.\" For Hari Seldon had told Wanda about his plan for a Second Foundation and she had committed herself to realizing that goal with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, though, Seldon was in a dark mood. He was coming to the conclusion that Wanda\u0027s mentalic ability would get him nowhere. He had no credits to continue his work-no credits to locate others like Wanda, no credits to pay his workers on the Psychohistory Project at Streeling, no credits to set up his all-important Encyclopedia Project at the Galactic Library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continued to walk toward the Galactic Library. He would have been better off taking a gravicab, but he wanted to walk-limp or not. He needed time to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard a cry-\"There he is!\"-but paid no attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came again. \"There he is! Psychohistory!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe word forced him to look up. Psychohistory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA group of young men was closing in around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAutomatically Seldon placed his back against the wall and raised his cane. \"What is it you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey laughed. \"Credits, old man. Do you have any credits?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe, but why do you want them from me? You said, \u0027Psychohistory!\u0027 Do you know who I am?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, you\u0027re Raven Seldon\" said the young man in the lead. He seemed both comfortable and pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a creep,\" shouted another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to do if I don\u0027t give you any credits?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll beat you up,\" said the leader, \"and we\u0027ll take them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if I give you my credits?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll beat you up anyway!\" They all laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHari Seldon raised his cane higher. \"Stay away. All of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy now he had managed to count them. There were eight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt himself choking slightly. Once he and Dors and Raych had been attacked by ten and they had had no trouble. He had been only thirty-two at the time and Dors-was Dors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was different. He waved his cane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe leader of the hoodlums said, \"Hey, the old man is going to attack us. What are we going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon looked around swiftly. There were no security officers around. Another indication of the deterioration of society. An occasional person or two passed by, but there was no use calling for help. Their footsteps increased in speed and made a wide detour. No one was going to run any risks of getting involved in an imbroglio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon said, \"The first one of you who approaches gets a cracked head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah?\" And the leader stepped forward rapidly and seized the cane. There was a short sharp struggle and the cane was wrested from Seldon\u0027s grip. The leader tossed it to one side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now what, old man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon shrunk back. He could only wait for the blows. They crowded around him, each eager to land a blow or two. Seldon lifted his arms to try to ward them off. He could still Twist-after a fashion. If he were facing only one or two, he might be able to Twist his body, avoid their blows, strike back. But not against eight-surely not against eight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried, at any rate, moving quickly to one side to avoid the blows and his right leg, with its sciatica, doubled under him. He fell and knew himself to be utterly helpless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he heard a stentorian voice shouting, \"What\u0027s going on here? Get back, you thugs! Back or I\u0027ll kill you all!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe leader said, \"Well, another old man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that old,\" said the newcomer. With the back of one hand, he struck the leader\u0027s face, turning it an ugly red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon said in surprise, \"Raych, it\u0027s you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych\u0027s hand swept back. \"Stay out of this, Dad. Just get up and move away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe leader, rubbing his cheek, said, \"We\u0027ll get you for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you won\u0027t,\" said Raych, drawing out a knife of Dahlite manufacture, long and gleaming. A second knife was withdrawn and he now held one in each hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon said weakly, \"Still carrying knives, Raych?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always,\" said Raych. \"Nothing will ever make me stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll stop you,\" said the leader, drawing out a blaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaster than the eye could follow, one of Raych\u0027s knives went sailing through the air and struck the leader\u0027s throat. He made a loud gasp, then a gurgling sound, and fell, while the other seven stared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych approached and said, \"I want my knife back.\" He drew it out of the hoodlum\u0027s throat and wiped it on the man\u0027s shirtfront. In doing so, he stepped on the man\u0027s hand, bent down, and picked up his blaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych dropped the blaster into one of his capacious pockets. He said, \"I don\u0027t like to use a blaster, you bunch of good-for-nothings, because sometimes I miss. I never miss with a knife, however. Never! That man is dead. There are seven of you standing. Do you intend to stay standing or will you leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get him!\" shouted one of the hoodlums and the seven made a concerted rush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych took a backward step. One knife flashed and then the other and two of the hoodlums stopped with, in each case, a knife buried in his abdomen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me back my knives,\" said Raych, pulling each out with a cutting motion and wiping them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These two are still alive, but not for long. That leaves five of you on your feet. Are you going to attack again or are you going to leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey turned and Raych called out, \"Pick up your dead and dying. I don\u0027t want them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHastily they flung the three bodies over their shoulders, then they turned tail and ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych bent to pick up Seldon\u0027s cane. \"Can you walk, Dad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not very well,\" said Seldon. \"I twisted my leg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well then, get into my car. What were you doing walking, anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? Nothing\u0027s ever happened to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you waited till something did. Get into my car and I\u0027ll give you a lift back to Streeling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe programmed the ground-car quietly, then said, \"What a shame we didn\u0027t have Dors with us. Mom would have attacked them with her bare lands and left all eight dead in five minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon felt tears stinging his eyelids. \"I know, Raych, I know. Do you think I don\u0027t miss her every day?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" said Raych in a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon asked, \"How did you know I was in trouble?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanda told me. She said there were evil people lying in wait for you, she told me where they were and I took right off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you doubt that she knew what she was talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all. We know enough about her now to know that she has some sort of contact with your mind and with the things around you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did she tell you how many people were attacking me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. She just said, \u0027Quite a few.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you came out all by yourself, did you, Raych?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had no time to put together a posse, Dad. Besides, one of me was enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it was. Thank you, Raych.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e14\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were back at Streeling now and Seldon\u0027s leg was stretched out on a hassock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych looked at him somberly. \"Dad,\" he began, \"you\u0027re not to go walking around Trantor on your own from now on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon frowned. \"Why, because of one incident?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was enough of an incident. You can\u0027t take care of yourself any longer. You\u0027re seventy years old and your right leg will not support you in an emergency. And you have enemies-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Enemies!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, indeed. And you know it. Those sewer rats were not after simply anyone. They were not looking for just any unwary person to rip off. They identified you by calling out, \u0027Psychohistory!\u0027 And they called you a creep. Why do you suppose that was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s because you live in a world all your own, Dad, and you don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on on Trantor. Don\u0027t you suppose the Trantorians know that their world is going downhill at a rapid rate? Don\u0027t you suppose they know that your psychohistory has been predicting this for years? Doesn\u0027t it occur to you that they may blame the messenger for the message? If things go bad-and they are going bad-there are many who think that you are responsible for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you suppose there\u0027s a faction at the Galactic Library that wants you out of there? They don\u0027t want to be in the way when you are mobbed. So-you\u0027ve got to take care of yourself. You can\u0027t go out alone. I\u0027ll have to be with you or you will have to have bodyguards. That\u0027s the way it\u0027s going to be, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon looked dreadfully unhappy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych softened and said, \"But not for long, Dad. I\u0027ve got a new job.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon looked up. \"A new job. What kind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Teaching. At a University.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which University?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Santanni.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon\u0027s lips trembled. \"Santanni! That\u0027s nine thousand parsecs away from Trantor. It\u0027s a provincial world on the other side of the Galaxy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly. That\u0027s why I want to go there. I\u0027ve been on Trantor all my life, Dad, and I\u0027m tired of it. There\u0027s no world in all the Empire that\u0027s deteriorating the way Trantor is. It\u0027s become a haunt of crime with no one to protect us. The economy is limping, the technology is failing. Santanni, on the other hand, is a decent world, still humming along, and I want to be there to build a new life, along with Manella and Wanda and Bellis. We\u0027re all going there in two months.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All of you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you, Dad. And you. We wouldn\u0027t leave you behind on Trantor. You\u0027re coming with us to Santanni.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon shook his head. \"Impossible, Raych. You know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why impossible?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know why. The Project. My psychohistory. Are you asking me to abandon my life\u0027s work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? It\u0027s abandoned you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re mad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027m not. Where are you going with it? You have no credits. You can\u0027t get any. There\u0027s no one left on Trantor who\u0027s willing to support you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For nearly forty year-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I admit that. But after all that time, you\u0027ve failed Dad. There\u0027s no crime in failing. You\u0027ve tried so hard and you\u0027ve gone so far, but you\u0027ve run into a deteriorating economy, a falling Empire. It\u0027s the very thing you\u0027ve been predicting for so long that\u0027s stopping you at last. So-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I will not stop. Somehow or other, I will keep going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tell you what, Dad. If you\u0027re really going to be so stubborn, then take psychohistory with you. Start it again on Santanni. There may be enough credits-and enthusiasm-to support it there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the men and women who have been working for me so faithfully?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh bull, Dad. They\u0027ve been leaving you because you can\u0027t pay them. You hang around here for the rest of your life and you\u0027ll be alone. Oh, come on, Dad. Do you think I like to talk to you this way? It\u0027s because no one has wanted to-because no one has had the heart to-that you\u0027re in your present predicament. Let\u0027s be honest with each other now. When you walk the streets of Trantor and you\u0027re attacked for no reason other than that you\u0027re Hari Seldon, don\u0027t you think it\u0027s time for a little bit of truth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind the truth. I have no intention of leaving Trantor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaych shook his head. \"I was sure you\u0027d be stubborn, Dad. You\u0027ve got two months to change your mind. Think about it, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e15\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been a long time since Hari Seldon had smiled. He had conducted the Project in the same fashion that he always did: pushing always forward in the development of psychohistory, making plans for the Foundation, studying the Prime Radiant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he did not smile. All he did was to force himself through his work without any feeling of impending success. Rather, there was a feeling of impending failure about everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now, as he sat in his office at Streeling University, Wanda entered. He looked up at her and his heart lifted. Wanda had always been special. Seldon couldn\u0027t put his finger on just when he and the others had started accepting her pronouncements with more than the usual enthusiasm; it just seemed always to have been that way. As a little girl, she had saved his life with her uncanny knowledge of \"lemonade death\" and all through her childhood she had somehow just known things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Dr. Endelecki had asserted that Wanda\u0027s genome was perfectly normal in every way, Seldon was still positive that his granddaughter possessed mental abilities far beyond those of average humans. And he was just as sure that there were others like her in the Galaxy-on Trantor, even. If only he could find them, these mentalics, what a great contribution they could make to the Foundation. The potential for such greatness all centered in his beautiful granddaughter. Seldon gazed at her, framed in his office doorway, and he felt as if his heart would break. In a few days, she would be gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could he bear it? She was such a beautiful girl-eighteen. Long blond hair, face a little broad but with a tendency to smile. She was even smiling now and Seldon thought, Why not? She\u0027s heading for Santanni and for a new life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Well, Wanda, just a few more days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I don\u0027t think so, Grandpa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWanda approached him and put her arms around him. \"I\u0027m not going to Santanni.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have your father and mother changed their minds?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, they\u0027re going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re not? Why? Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to stay here, Grandpa. With you.\" She hugged him. \"Poor Grandpa!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I don\u0027t understand. Why? Are they allowing this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean Mom and Dad. Not really. We\u0027ve been arguing over this for weeks, but I\u0027ve won out. Why not, Grandpa? They\u0027ll go to Santanni and they\u0027ll have each other-and they\u0027ll have little Bellis, too. But if I go with them and leave you here, you\u0027ll have no one. I don\u0027t think I could stand that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how did you get them to agree?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you know-I pushed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my mind. I can see what you have in yours and in theirs and, as time goes on, I can see more clearly. And I can push them to do what I want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. But after a while, they get tired of being pushed and they\u0027re willing to let me have my way. So I\u0027m going to stay with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon looked up at her with helpless love. \"This is wonderful, Wanda. But Bellis-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about Bellis. She doesn\u0027t have a mind like mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you certain?\" Seldon chewed at his lower lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quite certain. Besides, Mom and Dad have to have someone, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon wanted to rejoice, but he couldn\u0027t do so openly. There were Raych and Manella. What of them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Wanda, what about your parents? Can you be so cold-blooded about them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not cold-blooded. They understand. They realize I must be with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you manage that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I pushed,\" said Wanda simply, \"and eventually they came to see it my way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you did it because-\" Seldon paused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWanda said, \"Because I love you. Of course. And because-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must learn psychohistory. I know quite a bit of it already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From your mind. From the minds of others at the Project, especially from Uncle Yugo before he died. But it\u0027s in rags and tatters, so far. I want the real thing. Grandpa, I want a Prime Radiant of my own.\" Her face lit up and her words came quickly, with passion. \"I want to study psychohistory in great detail. Grandpa, you\u0027re quite old and quite tired. I\u0027m young and eager. I want to learn all I can, so I can carry on when-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeldon said, \"Well, that would be wonderful-if you could do it-but there is no funding anymore. I\u0027ll teach you all I can, but-we can\u0027t do anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll see, Grandpa. We\u0027ll see.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forward-the-foundation-foundation-7/page-25.html","bookId":2019,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:07:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:07:50 PM"}
