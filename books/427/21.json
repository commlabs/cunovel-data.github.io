WARNER.","content":"\u0026nbsp;When Herbert returned to the hotel he found George Melville in the reading room in conversation with a tall and dignified-looking stranger. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is that your brother, Mr. Melville?” asked the latter, as Herbert came forward and spoke to Melville.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, Colonel, he is my young friend and confidential clerk, Herbert Carr.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Glad to make your acquaintance, Mr. Carr,” said the colonel, affably, extending his hand as he spoke.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “This is Col. Warner, Herbert,” explained George Melville.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Herbert, who was naturally polite, shook hands with the colonel, and said he was glad to make his acquaintance.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I have been talking with Mr. Melville,” said the colonel. “I am sorry to hear that he is traveling in search of health.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, sir; I hope he will find his journey beneficial.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, not a doubt of it! Not a doubt of it! I\u0027ve been there myself. Do you know, when I was twenty-five, which I take to be about the age of your employer, I thought I should die of consumption?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I shouldn\u0027t have supposed it, sir,” said Herbert, and Melville, too, felt surprised, as he noticed the stalwart proportions of the former consumptive.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ha! ha! I dare say not,” said the colonel, laughing. “I don\u0027t look much like it now, eh?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, you certainly don\u0027t, colonel,” said Melville. “I am curious to know how you overcame the threatened danger.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I did what you are doing, sir; I came West.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But the mere coming West did not cure you, did it?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, sir; it was the life I lived,” returned Col. \\Varner. “I didn\u0027t stay in the cities; I went into the wilderness. I lived in a log-cabin. I bought a horse, and rode every day. I kept in the open air, and, after a while, I found my strength returning and my chest expanding, and in a twelvemonth I could afford to laugh at doctors.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And you have never had a return of the old symptoms?” asked Melville, with interest.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Never, except four years afterwards, when I went to New York and remained nearly a year. I am now fifty, and rather hale and hearty for my years, eh?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Decidedly so.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Let me advise you to follow my example, Mr. Melville.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It was my intention when I started West to live very much as you indicated,” said Melville. “Now that I have heard your experience, I am confirmed in my resolve.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Good! I am glad to hear it. When do you leave Chicago?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “To-morrow, probably.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And how far West do you intend to go?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I have thought of Colorado.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Couldn\u0027t do better. I know Colorado like a book. In fact, I own some valuable mining property there, up in—ahem! Gilpin County. By the way—I take it you are a rich man—why don\u0027t you invest in that way? Perhaps, however, you have it in view?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, I haven\u0027t thought of it,” answered Melville. “The fact is, I am not anxious to become richer, having enough for all my present needs.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Just so,” said the colonel. “But you might marry.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Even if I did—”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You would have money enough,” said Col. Warner, finishing the sentence for him. “Well, I am delighted to hear it. I am very well fixed myself—in fact, some of my friends call me, ha! ha!—the nabob. But, as I was saying I am rich enough and to spare, and still—you may be surprised—still I have no objection to making a little more money.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Col. Warner nodded his head vigorously, and watched George Melville to see the effect upon him of this extraordinary statement.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very natural, colonel,” said Melville. “I believe most people want to be richer. Perhaps if I had vigorous health I might have the same wish. At present my chief wish is to recover my health.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You\u0027ll do it, sir, you\u0027ll do it—and in short order, too! Then you can turn your attention to money-making.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Perhaps so,” said Melville, with a smile.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If not for yourself, for your young friend here,” added the colonel. “I take it he is not rich.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I have my fortune still to make, Col. Warner,” said Herbert, smiling.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The easiest thing in the world out here, my boy!” said the colonel, paternally. “So you start to-morrow?” he inquired, turning to Melville.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I think of it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Egad! I\u0027ve a great mind to accompany you,” said the colonel. “Why shouldn\u0027t I? I\u0027ve got through all my business in Chicago, and I like the pure air of the prairies best.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “We shall be glad of your company, colonel,” said Melville, politely.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you, sir; that decides me. I\u0027ll see you again and fix the hour of going, or rather I\u0027ll conform myself to your arrangements.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very well, colonel.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What do you think of my new acquaintance, Col. Warner, Herbert?” asked Melville when they were alone.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He seems to have a very good opinion of himself,” answered Herbert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, he is very well pleased with himself. He isn\u0027t a man exactly to my taste, but he seems a representative Western man. He does not look much like a consumptive?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I feel an interest in him on that account,” said Melville, seriously. “If at any time I could become as strong and stalwart I would willingly surrender one-half, nay nine-tenths of my fortune. Ill health is a great drag upon a man; it largely curtails his enjoyments, and deprives him of all ambition.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don\u0027t see why his remedy wouldn\u0027t work well in your case, Mr. Melville,” said Herbert, earnestly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Perhaps it may. At any rate, I feel inclined to try it. I am glad the colonel is going to travel with us, as I shall be able to question him about the details of his cure. He seems a bluff, genial fellow, and though I don\u0027t expect to enjoy his companionship much, I hope to derive some benefit from it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “By the way, Mr. Melville, I met an old acquaintance while I was out walking,” said Herbert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Indeed!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Eben Graham.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How did he look—prosperous?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Hardly—he was wheeling a barrow of vegetables.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Did you speak with him?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes; he wanted to borrow money.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am not surprised at that; I thought it time for him to be out of money. Did you lend him?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No; I found he wanted money to buy a lottery ticket. I told him I wouldn\u0027t lend money to my best friend for that purpose.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very sensible in you, Herbert.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If he had been in distress, I might have let him have a few dollars, notwithstanding he treated me so meanly at Wayneboro, but he seems to be earning a living.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I presume he doesn\u0027t enjoy the business he is in?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No; he complains that he has lowered himself by accepting such a place.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It doesn\u0027t occur to him that he lowered himself when he stole money from his father, I suppose.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It doesn\u0027t seem to.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Later in the day Herbert came across Col. Warner in the corridor of the hotel.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ha! my young friend!” he said, affably. “I am glad to meet you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you, sir.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “And how is your friend?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No change since morning,” answered Herbert, slightly smiling.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “By the way, Herbert—your name is Herbert, isn\u0027t it—may I offer you a cigar?” said Col. Warner.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The colonel opened his cigar-case and extended it to Herbert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you, sir, but I don\u0027t smoke.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Don\u0027t smoke? That is, you don\u0027t smoke cigars. May I offer you a cigarette?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I don\u0027t smoke at all, colonel.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Indeed, remarkable! Why, sir, before I was your age I smoked.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do you think it good for consumption?” asked Herbert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ha, ha, you have me there! Well, perhaps not. Do you know,” said the colonel, changing the conversation, “I feel a great interest in your friend.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You are very kind.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “\u0027Upon my soul, I do. He is a most interesting young man. Rich, too! I am glad he is rich!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He would value health more than money,” said Herbert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “To be sure, to be sure! By the way, you don\u0027t know how much property your friend has?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No, sir, he never told me,” answered Herbert, surprised at the question.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Keeps such matters close, eh? Now, I don\u0027t. I never hesitate to own up to a quarter of a million. Yes, quarter of a million! That\u0027s the size of my pile.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You are fortunate, Col. Warner,” said Herbert, sincerely.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “So I am, so I am! Two years hence I shall have half a million, if all goes well. So you won\u0027t have a cigar; no? Well, I\u0027ll see you later.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He\u0027s a strange man,” thought Herbert. “I wonder if his statements can be relied upon.” Somehow Herbert doubted it. He was beginning to distrust the colonel.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2962/81525.html","bookId":427,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 4:03:32 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 4:03:32 AM"}
