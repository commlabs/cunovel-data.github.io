The height of her chair didn’t bother Elle so much as the uncertainty. Every time the servants took a step her chair jostled, making Elle horribly aware that she was quite literately in their hands. The servants paused at the top of a marble staircase, and Elle gulped. “Are we…?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe servants carefully started down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery muscle in Elle’s body was tensed as she teetered back and forth with the movement of the footmen. It took an eternity to reach the bottom step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmele patted Elle’s hand and pointed to two ornately decorated doors directly ahead of them. Two maids stood in front of the doors, and they curtseyed before opening the doors, allowing Elle’s entourage through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the room was a giant table… and Prince Severin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cursed prince sat at the head of the table. Half of his horrifically feline face was immersed in papers even though the only light in the room was a crackling fire directly behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe prince looked up when the footmen set Elle down at the other end of the table. His horrible yellow eyes never touched Elle. Severin fixed them on his servants as he set his papers down with more force than necessary. A growl trickled from his throat before he picked up a book and flipped it open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe footmen bowed to the illegitimate prince and then to Elle before leaving the room with Emele.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElle shifted in her chair, alone with Severin and only the barest light—for Severin’s hulking body blocked most of the firelight from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is…unexpected,” Elle said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe prince ignored her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElle looked around the room, smoothing the soft fabric of her dress across her legs. The room’s suffocating silence was worse, even, then the lack of sound in Elle’s room. Severin seemed determined to ignore her presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElle shamelessly stared at Severin. She hadn’t met him, or even seen him, in spite of all her trips to the palace in Noyers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElle frowned as her eyes traced his beastly body. He was frightening by the sheer nature of his features. White teeth poked past the lips of his massive feline head. His feet and hands were fitted with claws that could rip a man apart. His cursed appearance very accurately reflected his personality. He was, after all, a predator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeverin looked up, but not to notice Elle. He stared at the door, which creaked open moments later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn trooped a stream of housemaids carrying beeswax candles, which they set around the perimeter of the room—considerably lightening it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrystal chandeliers in the ceiling caught the flickering flames and reflected them across the room, bouncing candlelight off mirrors fixed on the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the housemaids came the kitchen maids—all masked and silent. They carried trays and trays of food—more than Severin and Elle could possibly eat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Emele seems to have given you all the impression that I possess a ravenous appetite,” Elle said as a kitchen maid set a tray of quaking pudding down in front of Elle while another maid poured wine in her cup and served tea. “No harm done, I suppose. She’s probably right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the maids finished they left as silently as they arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElle shifted her gaze from the sea of food to Severin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeverin folded up his papers and put them in a waterproof case. He wordlessly took his elaborately folded cloth napkin, shook it out, and set it on his lap before he began serving himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElle followed his example, taking a scoopful of hash, snow cream, quaking pudding, and cheeses. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-and-the-beast-timeless-fairy-tales-1/page-10.html","bookId":1808,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:55:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:55:06 PM"}
