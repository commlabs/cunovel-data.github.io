A whimper later, I squeezed my eyes shut and clutched my temples, wishing to be put out of my misery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Morning, lover,” a voice cooed in my ear and a hand slid up my bare thigh. Cora rubbed against me, her naked breasts crushing my bicep. “I’ve been waiting for you to wake up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to unstick my dried tongue from the roof of my mouth. “What...what time is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Too late for you to make pancakes, but that’s okay.” Five very greedy fingers curled around my morning wood. “I’d rather have sausage anyway.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes nearly crossed as the pain in my head mixed with the pleasure spreading from my groin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were so amazing last night,” Cora murmured in my ear just before she nipped the lobe with her teeth. “Do you remember how awesome it was?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked up at the ceiling, trying to remember last night at all. But I came up with a big blank nothing. Why couldn’t I remember what had happened?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Best night of my entire life.” My girlfriend moaned as she pumped me a little faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached out and caught her around the waist, discovering she was as naked as I was. She mewed when I slid my hand over her bottom. Then I urged her to slide on top of me, and she was more than willing to climb onto my lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCora found a condom and was sliding it into place before I could even go searching for one myself. And then she was lowering herself onto me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty minutes later, we were both still panting, she was sprawled against my chest, too bonelessly weary to move, and I still couldn’t remember a single detail from the night before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” I finally admitted. “I don’t remember last night at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI began to rub her back, hoping she didn’t get upset because whatever had happened last night had set her off this morning until she’d been chanting how much she loved me just five minutes ago when she’d come...for the second time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut instead of getting mad, she laughed and rubbed her nose against my throat. “Yeah, you did have a bit much to drink.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes opened wide. “I drank?” A sudden vision hit me of downing a big gulp and then laughing at something I said to a girl...except the girl I’d been laughing with hadn’t been Cora. At least, I don’t think it’d been Cora. I swear, it’d been Zoey. But I’d been leaning into her until we were almost touching as I’d laughed, which couldn’t be right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why was I drinking?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ten talked you into it, or something. I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ten?” Oh. Right. The double date. I winced, hoping Zoey had fared okay with Ten, since I obviously hadn’t been in the right frame of mind to keep him in line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You and Zoey both got plastered.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyebrows crinkled. “We did?” Now that just sounded weird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCora started kissing her way down my chest. “Yep. And then you sang to me on the karaoke.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes widened. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then you danced with me until we came home and made love for the rest of the night. I’ve never seen you so insatiable before. It was like you just couldn’t get enough of me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flushed, wishing I could remember that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then another flashing memory popped into my head. I’d been squeezing my eyes closed as I gasped for breath and pounded hard and without finesse into a woman. I’d been thinking about Zoey, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze sprang guiltily to Cora. I’d been thinking about her roommate while I’d been inside her. That had to be the absolute worst thing I’d ever done. I wanted to apologize and beg her forgiveness, but no way did I want to actually confess to her what I’d done...or why I hadn’t been able to “get enough of her” last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh God. I think I needed to throw up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were, like, the man I always knew you could be.” Cora rolled off me to curl against my side. Gazing lovingly at me, she kept running her hand up and down my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew it was wrong, but I couldn’t tell her. There was no point. It’d only hurt her, and I couldn’t take it back now. Wishing I could do something—anything—to make it up to Cora, I rolled toward her and nuzzled my nose into her neck, breathing in her scent and silently apologizing for picturing someone else while I should’ve been concentrating on nothing but her. She purred at my apologetic cuddling and clutched handfuls of my hair. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-89.html","bookId":2703,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM"}
