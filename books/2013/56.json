He stared, seeing nothing yet, sensing how something was wrong-he was on his side, but his head was flattened down, his ear pressed to the ground. There should have been a shoulder below and beneath his head, and an arm, and it was where all the heat was pouring out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd further down, the side of his chest, this too seemed to be gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could feel his right leg, kicking at the ground. But no left leg. He did not understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, he settled onto his back, stared up at the night sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much room up there, a ceiling beyond the reach of everyone, covering a place in which they could live. Uncrowded, room enough for all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was glad, he realized, that he had come here, to see, to witness, to understand. Glad, even as he died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRedmask walked out of the dark to where Masarch waited with the Letherii horse. Behind him, the rodara herd was a mass of movement, the dominant males in the lead, their attention fixed on Redmask. Dogs barked and nipped from the far flanks. Distant shouts from the other two young warriors indicated they were where they should be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClimbing into the saddle, Redmask nodded to Masarch then swung his mount round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePausing for a long moment, Masarch stared at the distant Letherii camp, where it seemed the unholy slaughter continued unabated. His guardians, he’d said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe does not fear challenges to come. He will take the fur of the Ganetok war leader. He will lead us to war against the Letherii. He is Redmask, who forswore the Awl, only to now return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought it Was too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI now think 1 am wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought again of his death night, and memories returned like winged demons. He had gone mad, in that hollowed-out log, gone so far mad that hardly any of him had survived to return, when the morning light blinded him. Now, the insanity was loose, tingling at the very ends of his limbs, loose and wild but as yet undecided, not yet ready to act, to show its face. There was nothing to hold it back. No-one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo-one but Redmask. My war leader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho unleashed his own madness years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDenigration afflicted our vaunted ideals long ago, but such inflictions are difficult to measure, to rise up and point a finger to this place, this moment, and say: here, my friends, this was where our honour, our integrity died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe affliction was too insipid, too much a product of our surrendering mindful regard and diligence. The meanings of words lost their precision-and no-one bothered taking to task those who cynically abused those words to serve their own ambitions, their own evasion of personal responsibility. Lies went unchallenged, lawful pursuit became a sham, vulnerable to graft, and justice itself became a commodity, mutable in imbalance. Truth was lost, a chimera reshaped to match agenda, prejudices, thus consigning the entire political process to a mummer’s charade of false indignation, hypocritical posturing and a pervasive contempt for the commonry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce subsumed, ideals and the honour created by their avowal can never be regained, except, alas, by outright, unconstrained rejection, invariably instigated by the commonry, at the juncture of one particular moment, one single event, of such brazen injustice that revolution becomes the only reasonable response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsider this then a warning. Liars will lie, and continue to do so, even beyond being caught out. They will lie, and in time, such liars will convince themselves, will in all self-righteousness divest the liars of culpability. Until comes a time when one final lie is voiced, the one that can only be answered by rage, by cold murder, and on that day, blood shall rain down every wall of this vaunted, weaning society.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e– Impeached Guild Master’s Speech, Semel Fural of the Guild of Sandal-Clasp Makers\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf the turtles known as vinik the females dwelt for the most part in the uppermost reaches of the innumerable sources of the Lether River, in the pooled basins and high-ground bogs found in the coniferous forests crowding the base of the Bluerose Mountains. The mountain runoff, stemmed and backed by the dams built by flat-tailed river-rats, descended in modest steps towards the broader, conjoined tributaries feeding the vast river. Vinik turtles were long-shelled and dorsal-ridged, and their strong forelimbs ended in taloned hands bearing opposable thumbs. In the egg-laying season, the females-smaller by far than their male kin of the deep rivers and the seas-prowled the ponds seeking the nests of waterfowl. Finding one large enough and properly accessible, the female vinik would appropriate it. Prior to laying her own eggs, the turtle exuded a slime that coated the bird eggs, the slime possessing properties that suspended the development of those young birds. Once the vinik’s clutch was in place, the turtle then dislodged the entire nest, leaving it free to float, drawn by the current. At each barrier juvenile male vinik were gathered, to drag the nests over dry ground so that they could continue their passive migration down to the Lether River. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-56.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
