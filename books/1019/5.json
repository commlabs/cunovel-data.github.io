LYMAN TAYLOR MAKES A NEW ACQUAINTANCE.","content":"On leaving the cabin Mark promised to call again the next afternoon, bringing from the village such articles as Anthony might require. This he could readily do as the shoe manufactory was not running full time.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will see that you are paid for your trouble,\" said the hermit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That will be all right,\" said Mark, cheerfully.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am able to pay you, and will employ you only on that condition,\" persisted Anthony.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I shall not object to that part of the bargain,\" said Mark, smiling. \"Money never comes amiss to me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have plenty of money, though I would not admit it to my nephew,\" continued the sick man. \"He would persecute me till I bought him off. Fortunately he thinks I am poor.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But,\" said Mark, \"suppose he should come back. Would not your money be in danger?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He would find none here. I do not keep any in this cabin. I did have some, but it is in your hands.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Shall I not return it to you, sir?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No; I prefer that you should keep it. You will be using money for me daily, and for the present you shall be my treasurer.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I am very much obliged to you for reposing so much confidence in me,\" said Mark.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I trust you entirely. You have an honest face.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank you, sir. I will endeavor to deserve your confidence.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was past four o\u0027clock when Mark left the cabin and started on his way homeward. He walked along thoughtfully, carrying his gun over his shoulder.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It seems I have a near friend,\" he reflected; \"and one who may be of service to me. Now that the shop is no longer running full time, it will be convenient to earn a little extra money, old Anthony must be rich, judging from what he said about his success in California.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mark could not help wondering where the hermit kept his money. But for Anthony\u0027s positive assurance, he would have conjectured that he kept it somewhere concealed about the cabin, but that being left out of the question he was at a loss to fix upon any probable place of deposit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Leaving Mark for a brief time; we go back to the other two young hunters, from whom he had separated two hours before.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t like that boy,\" said James Collins. \"He puts on too many airs for a poor boy. I suppose he will be crowing over his successful shot.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very likely,\" chimed in his companion, who made it a point to flatter James by agreeing with everything he said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It was only a lucky accident,\" continued James. \"He couldn\u0027t do it again.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course not. I don\u0027t think he is really as good a shot as you or I.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You can hardly class yourself with me,\" said James egotistically. \"However. I agree with you that he is inferior to you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Quick, James!\" said Tom Wyman. \"There is a squirrel—shoot! I\u0027ll give you the first chance.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e James pulled the trigger, but the squirrel was not destined to fall by his hands. He scampered away, looking back saucily at the baffled young hunter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Was ever anything more provoking?\" asked James in evident chagrin.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Later in the afternoon when the two boys were slowly strolling homewards, they saw a strange man issuing from the woods. It was Lyman Taylor, returned from his only partially successful visit to his uncle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He waited till the boys came up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good afternoon, young gentlemen,\" he said by way of greeting.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good afternoon,\" returned James stiffly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He doubted whether the newcomer was a man whom it was worth while to notice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What luck have you had? I see you have been out hunting.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We didn\u0027t shoot anything we thought worth bringing home,\" said Tom.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I met another boy out with a gun. Perhaps he is a friend of yours.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e James and Tom exchanged glances. They understood very well that Mark Manning was meant.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think I know the boy you met,\" said James. \"It is a poor boy who works in my father\u0027s manufactory.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What is his name?\" asked Lyman Taylor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mark Manning.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Does he live in the village?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes; his mother is a poor widow.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where did you meet him?\" asked Tom.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"At a cabin in the woods.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Old Anthony\u0027s?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes; the hermit is an uncle of mine.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The two boys regarded the speaker with interest. All the villagers had some curiosity about the man who had settled so near them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What is his name?\" inquired Tom.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You called him old Anthony,\" said Lyman, smiling. \"That is his name.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But his other name?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"His last name is Taylor, I have not seen him before for five years. Does he often come into the village?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"About twice a week.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I suppose he comes to buy food?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes; I suppose so.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Does he appear to be provided with money?\" asked Taylor with some eagerness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, I believe so,\" replied Tom. \"He has sometimes come into our place—father is the postmaster—to get a gold piece changed. But I don\u0027t suppose he has much money. It doesn\u0027t cost him much to live.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Does he ever get any letters—as your father is postmaster, you can probably tell.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t think so; my father has never mentioned it, and I think he would if any had been received.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What sort of a boy is this Mark Manning?\" asked Taylor abruptly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t think much of him,\" answered James. \"He is poor and proud. He is only a pegger in our shop, but he puts on airs with the best.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do you think he is honest?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The two boys looked surprised; that question had never occurred to them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What makes you ask?\" inquired James.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Only that he has in his possession a sum of money belonging to my uncle.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did he tell you so? did you see it?\" were the questions quickly asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I met him at my uncle\u0027s cabin. My uncle owed me a small sum, and instead of paying me himself, he asked this boy to pay me. The boy took the money from his pocket, and handed it to me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Both boys were surprised.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I didn\u0027t know he had anything to do with the hermit,\" said Tom. \"Did you, James?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No; but then I don\u0027t trouble myself about Mark Manning\u0027s affairs.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lyman Taylor regarded James shrewdly, he had no difficulty in detecting the boy\u0027s dislike towards Mark.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Excuse my troubling you with questions, young gentlemen,\" he said. \"My uncle is a simple-minded old man, and it would be easy to rob him, though I fancy he hasn\u0027t much money. This boy Mark appeared to me an artful young rogue, who might very probably cheat him out of the small sum he has.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I never saw the two together,\" said Tom, musingly. \"Old Anthony has generally paid his bills himself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He is sick just now, and perhaps that accounts for it. The boy Mark has been making purchases for him in the village. However, I must leave the place, as important business calls me elsewhere. Since you,\" addressing Tom, \"are the postmaster\u0027s son, may I ask a favor of you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Certainly.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If my uncle should die, can I trouble you to send me a note informing me, as I should feel called upon, as his only relative, to see that he was properly buried.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir; I will write you, if you will leave me your address.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lyman Taylor gave Tom the same address he had already given Mark. He then bade the boys good-bye, and walked on.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Uncle Anthony may have some money,\" he soliloquized, \"and if he dies, I shall see if I can find it. I am pretty sure to hear through one of the boys.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1828/53027.html","bookId":1019,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:19:41 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:19:41 PM"}
