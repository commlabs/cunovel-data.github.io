Dirt was also under his fingernails. And it wasn\u0027t just dirt, but something else. Clay?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pardon my appearance. I was on an emergency dig.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Digging what?\" I asked, and was all too aware that my inner alarm was ringing even louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came closer, grinning macabrely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked, quite frankly, insane. \"Tell you what, Samantha. I will show you someday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow does that sound?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Weird as hell,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"Yes, I suppose it does sound sort of odd.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis aura, like that of Tara and old Cal, rippled with a dark thread-like energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept in Edwin, the darkness was more evident. I had assumed the darkness was a result of grief...now, I wasn\u0027t sure what to think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you keep smiling like that?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027m just a happy-go-lucky kind of guy. Made even happier now that you\u0027re here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy inner alarm blared loudly. \"What the hell does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, nothing. We just so rarely get visitors here on our little island.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m beginning to see why,\" I said, and found myself inching away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"Yes, we are an odd lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot exactly your typical family. And like most families, we have our hidden demons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words hit home. \"You\u0027re one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man continued grinning bizarrely. \"One of whom, Samantha Moon?\" He used my full name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a Dark Master,\" I said, using the term for the thing that lived in me, the thing that had mastered immortality, the thing that lived on through me using the darkest of magicks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dark Master? I like that. I\u0027m very flattered, Sam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flashed me another crazy smile, and now I saw something else within him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething human. It was in his eyes, and it made a brief appearance. I saw the young man. The real Edwin Thurman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHidden. Pushed aside. Suffocated. But as quickly as he appeared, he disappeared again, like flotsam rising briefly to the ocean surface, only to be sucked under the dark waters again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdwin - or whoever was before me - stepped around me, clasping his hands behind his back. I got a very powerful psychic hit, and one that I knew was true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not like the others,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at me, arching an eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? Do tell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are, if I\u0027m correct, permanently present. You\u0027re not hidden in the background, not like the others, not like the thing within me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a thing, Sam.\" His annoyance surprised me. He paused, held my gaze, and added, \"My sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gasped and backed away some more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m not saying that metaphorically, Samantha Moon. Residing within you is my sister, and someday soon - very, very soon - she and I will be together again.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/moon-island-vampire-for-hire-7/page-18.html","bookId":2136,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:13:27 PM"}
