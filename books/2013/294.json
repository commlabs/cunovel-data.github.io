How many soldiers did you land on the coast, Adjunct? Ten thousand? Twenty? I saw the ships, the burning ships-you followed our fleets all the way from your empire? That’s a long way for a little vengeful bloodletting, isn’t it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShurq dreamed of downing another tankard of wine. At least the Malazans weren’t looking her way any more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Adjunct’s frown deepened, accentuating her drab plainness. ‘If you wish,’ she said coolly, ‘we can formalize your status as prisoners of war. Yet I find it difficult to characterize your sinking ferry as a punitive invasion expedition. According to the reports I have received, your status is better likened as refugees, yes? A modest company of soldiers overseeing a sizeable collection of old men and women, children and other non-combatants. Were you sailing here assuming the island remained independent?’ She flicked her gaze across to Brullyg, who stood leaning against the far wall. ‘That you and Shake Brullyg are acquainted suggests you are here to resolve some private matter between you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Tovis’s eyes were flat as she shrugged and said, ‘Hardly private. “Shake” is a tribe’s name and could, if desired, precede the names of myself and Yedan here, as well as our “collection” of “refugees”. The Shake were the original inhabitants of the central west coast and some of the islands off shore. We were long ago subjugated by the Letherii.’ She shrugged again. ‘My issue with Brullyg refers to a matter of succession.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTavore’s brows rose. ‘Succession? You retain such things even when subjugated?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘More or less. The line is maintained through the women. The Queen-my mother-has recently died. It was Brullyg’s hope that I not return to claim the title. Brullyg wanted to rule the Shake for himself. He also wanted, I suspect, to make some bold claim to independence, riding the wave of your invasion-assuming it proves successful. Casting off the Letherii yoke and creating a new centre for our people, on this once-holy island. Although a murderer and a betrayer, Brullyg is an ambitious creature. Alas, his rule on this island has come to an end.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroatslitter hissed laughter. ‘Hear that, Masan Gilani? You can stop showing all that sweet flesh now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am not sure,’ the Adjunct said, ‘the decision is yours to make, Atri-Preda.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That rank is now gone. You may address me as Queen or, if you like, as Twilight.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShurq Elalle saw Deadsmell’s eyes flick open then, saw them fix hard and unblinking on Yan Tovis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Adjunct missed nothing, for she glanced at Deadsmell for a moment, then away again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Twilight, Watch and Rise,’ Deadsmell muttered. ‘Covered the whole night, haven’t ya? But damn me, the blood’s awful thin. Your skin’s the colour of clay-couldn’t have been more than a handful at the start, probably refugees hiding among the local savages. A pathetic handful, but the old titles remained. Guarding the Shores of Night.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Tovis licked her lips. ‘Just the Shore,’ she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeadsmell smiled. ‘Lost the rest, did you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Corporal,’ Tavore said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Our squad spent time on the right ship,’ Deadsmell explained. ‘Enough for me to do plenty of talking with our black-skinned guests. Twilight,’ he said to Yan Tovis, ‘that’s a Letherii word you use. Would you be surprised if I told you the word for “twilight”, in your original language, was “yenander”? And that “antovis” meant “night” or even “dark”? Your own name is your title, and I can see by your expression that you didn’t even know it. Yedan Derryg? Not sure what “derryg” is-we’ll need to ask Sandalath-but “yedanas” is “watch”, both act and title. Gods below, what wave was that? The very first? And why the Shore? Because that’s where newborn K’Chain Che’Malle came from, isn’t it? The ones not claimed by a Matron, that is.’ His hard eyes held on Yan Tovis a moment longer, then he settled back once more and closed his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErrant fend, is he going to do that all evening?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I do not know what he is talking about,’ Yan Tovis said, but it was clear that she had been rattled. ‘You are all foreigners-what can you know of the Shake? We are barely worth mentioning even in Letherii history.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Twilight,’ said Tavore, ‘you are here to assert your title as Queen-will you also proclaim this island sovereign?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-294.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
