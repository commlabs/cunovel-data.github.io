{"id":7065,"no":16,"title":"The Sixth Tuesday We Talk About Emotions","content":"\u003cp\u003eI walked past the mountain laurels and the Japanese maple, up the bluestone steps of Morrie\u0027s house. The white rain gutter hung like a lid over the doorway. I rang the bell and was greeted not by Connie but by Morrie\u0027s wife, Charlotte, a beautiful gray-haired woman who spoke in a lilting voice. She was not often at home when I came by-she continued working at MIT, as Morrie wished-and I was surprised this morning to see her.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Morrie\u0027s having a bit of a hard time today,\" she said. She stared over my shoulder for a moment, then moved toward the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sorry, I said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, he\u0027ll be happy to see you,\" she said quickly. \"Sure . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped in the middle of the sentence, turning her head slightly, listening for something. Then she continued. \"I\u0027m sure . . . he\u0027ll feel better when he knows you\u0027re here.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI lifted up the bags from the market-my normal food supply, I said jokingly-and she seemed to smile and fret at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s already so much food. He hasn\u0027t eaten any from last time.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis took me by surprise. He hasn\u0027t eaten any, I asked?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe opened the refrigerator and I saw familiar containers of chicken salad, vermicelli, vegetables, stuffed squash, all things I had brought for Morrie. She opened the freezer and there was even more.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Morrie can\u0027t eat most of this food. It\u0027s too hard for him to swallow. He has to eat soft things and liquid drinks now.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut he never said anything, I said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte smiled. \"He doesn\u0027t want to hurt your feelings.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt wouldn\u0027t have hurt my feelings. I just wanted to help in some way. I mean, I just wanted to bring him something . . .\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You are bringing him something. He looks forward to your visits. He talks about having to do this project with you, how he has to concentrate and put the time aside. I think it\u0027s giving him a good sense of purpose . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAgain, she gave that faraway look, the tuning-in-something-from-somewhere-else. I knew Morrie\u0027s nights were becoming difficult, that he didn\u0027t sleep through them, and that meant Charlotte often did not sleep through them either. Sometimes Morrie would lie awake coughing for hours-it would take that long to get the phlegm from his throat. There were health care workers now staying through the night and all those visitors during the day, former students, fellow professors, meditation teachers, tramping in and out of the house. On some days, Morrie had a half a dozen visitors, and they were often there when Charlotte returned from work. She handled it with patience, even though all these outsiders were soaking up her precious minutes with Morrie.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\". . . a sense of purpose,\" she continued. \"Yes. That\u0027s good, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope so,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI helped put the new food inside the refrigerator. The kitchen counter had all kinds of notes, messages, information, medical instructions. The table held more pill bottles than ever-Selestone for his asthma, Ativan to help him sleep, naproxen for infections-along with a powdered milk mix and laxatives. From down the hall, we heard the sound of a door open.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he\u0027s available now . . . let me go check.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte glanced again at my food and I felt suddenly ashamed. All these reminders of things Morrie would never enjoy.\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003e\"Is the tape on?\" he said suddenly, his eyes still closed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eYes, yes, I quickly said, pressing down the play and record buttons.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What I\u0027m doing now,\" he continued, his eyes still closed, \"is detaching myself from the experience.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDetaching yourself?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Detaching myself. And this is important-not just for someone like me, who is dying, but for someone like you, who is perfectly healthy. Learn to detach.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his eyes. He exhaled. \"You know what the Buddhists say? Don\u0027t cling to things, because everything is impermanent.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut wait, I said. Aren\u0027t you always talking about experiencing life? All the good emotions, all the bad ones?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. \"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWell, how can you do that if you\u0027re detached?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah. You\u0027re thinking, Mitch. But detachment doesn\u0027t mean you don\u0027t let the experience penetrate you. On the contrary, you let it penetrate you fully. That\u0027s how you are able to leave it.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m lost.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Take any emotion-love for a woman, or grief for a loved one, or what I\u0027m going through, fear and pain from a deadly illness. If you hold back on the emotions-if you don\u0027t allow yourself to go all the way through them-you can never get to being detached, you\u0027re too busy being afraid. You\u0027re afraid of the pain, you\u0027re afraid of the grief. You\u0027re afraid of the vulnerability that loving entails.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"But by throwing yourself into these emotions, by allowing yourself to dive in, all the way, over your head even, you experience them fully and completely. You know what pain is. You know what love is. You know what grief is. And only then can you say, `All right. I have experienced that emotion. I recognize that emotion. Now I need to detach from that emotion for a moment.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMorrie stopped and looked me over, perhaps to make sure I was getting this right.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you think this is just about dying,\" he said, \"but it\u0027s like I keep telling you. When you learn how to die, you learn how to live.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMorrie talked about his most fearful moments, when he felt his chest locked in heaving surges or when he wasn\u0027t sure where his next breath would come from. These were horrifying times, he said, and his first emotions were horror, fear, anxiety. But once he recognized the feel of those emotions, their texture, their moisture, the shiver down the back, the quick flash of heat that crosses your brain-then he was able to say, \"Okay. This is fear. Step away from it. Step away.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI thought about how often this was needed in everyday life. How we feel lonely, sometimes to the point of tears, but we don\u0027t let those tears come because we are not supposed to cry. Or how we feel a surge of love for a partner but we don\u0027t say anything because we\u0027re frozen with the fear of what those words might do to the relationship.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMorrie\u0027s approach was exactly the opposite. Turn on the faucet. Wash yourself with the emotion. It won\u0027t hurt you. It will only help. If you let the fear inside, if you pull it on like a familiar shirt, then you can say to yourself, \"All right, it\u0027s just fear, I don\u0027t have to let it control me. I see it for what it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSame for loneliness: you let go, let the tears flow, feel it completely-but eventually be able to say, \"All right, that was my moment with loneliness. I\u0027m not afraid of feeling lonely, but now I\u0027m going to put that loneliness aside and know that there are other emotions in the world, and I\u0027m going to experience them as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Detach,\" Morrie said again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes, then coughed. Then he coughed again.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen he coughed again, more loudly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, he was half-choking, the congestion in his lungs seemingly teasing him, jumping halfway up, then dropping back down, stealing his breath. He was gagging, then hacking violently, and he shook his hands in front of him-with his eyes closed, shaking his hands, he appeared almost possessed-and I felt my forehead break into a sweat. I instinctively pulled him forward and slapped the back of his shoulders, and he pushed a tissue to his mouth and spit out a wad of phlegm.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe coughing stopped, and Morrie dropped back into the foam pillows and sucked in air.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay? You all right?\" I said, trying to hide my fear.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m . . . okay,\" Morrie whispered, raising a shaky finger. \"Just . . . wait a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWe sat there quietly until his breathing returned to normal. I felt the perspiration on my scalp. He asked me to close the window, the breeze was making him cold. I didn\u0027t mention that it was eighty degrees outside.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFinally, in a whisper, he said, \"I know how I want to die.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI waited in silence.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to die serenely. Peacefully. Not like what just happened.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"And this is where detachment comes in. If I die in the middle of a coughing spell like I just had, I need to be able to detach from the horror, I need to say, `This is my moment.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to leave the world in a state of fright. I want to know what\u0027s happening, accept it, get to a peaceful place, and let go. Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t let go yet, I added quickly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMorrie forced a smile. \"No. Not yet. We still have work to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cp\u003eWhat would you come back as? `If I had my choice, a gazelle.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\" A gazelle?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. So graceful. So fast.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\" A gazelle?\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMorrie smiles at me. \"You think that\u0027s strange?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI study his shrunken frame, the loose clothes, the sockswrapped feet that rest stiffly on foam rubber cushions, unable to move, like a prisoner in leg irons. I picture a gazelle racing across the desert.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNo, I say. I don\u0027t think that\u0027s strange at all.\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/260/2467.html","bookId":229,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 7:24:23 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 7:24:23 AM"}
