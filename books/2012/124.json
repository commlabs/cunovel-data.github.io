Until the new gods arrived. And they were far thirstier for blood than the tigers ever were, and now the jungle is silent .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis night, he knew, here in this cave, he would dream of the hunt, the perfect stalking of the perfect prey, and dragging his victim up the trail and into this cave, away from the hyenas and jackals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs dreams went, it wasn’t that bad. As dreams went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack fur, the taste of blood in my mouth …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had found him outside the walls of a dead city. Kneeling on a dusty road, collecting the shattered remnants of an old pot, but it was not just one pot that had broken apart, it was hundreds. A panicked flight, smoke and flames rising to blacken the limestone cliffs against which the city had cowered, the blurred passing of wretched faces, like broken husks and flotsam in a river. Things fell, things fell apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was trying to put the pieces back together, and as Mappo drew nearer he looked up, but only briefly, before returning to his task. ‘Good sir,’ he said, with one finger pushing shards back and forth, endlessly rearranging, seeking patterns, ‘Good sir, have you by chance some glue?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rage was gone, and with it all memory. Icarium knelt with his back to a city he had destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing, Mappo set his heavy satchel down, and then crouched. ‘Too many broke here,’ he said, ‘for you to repair. It would take weeks, maybe even months.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But I have time.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMappo flinched, looked away – but not at the city, where capemoths crowded window sills in the slope-walled buildings leaning against the cliff walls, where the scorch marks streaked the stone like slashes into night. Not at the city, with its narrow streets filled with rubble and corpses, and the rhizan lizards swarming the cold, rotting flesh, and the bhok’arala clambering down to lick sticky stains for the salt and snatching up bundles of clothing with which to make nests. And not at the gate, the doors blasted apart, the heaps of dead soldiers swelling inside their armour as the day’s heat burgeoned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared instead southward, to the old caravan camps marked only by low stone foundations and pens for sheep and goats. Never again would the desert traders travel to this place; never again would merchants from distant cities come seeking the famous Redworm Silks of Shikimesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I thought, friend,’ Mappo said, and then he shook his head. ‘Only yesterday you spoke of journeying. Northeast, you said, to the coast.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIcarium looked up, frowned. ‘I did?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Seeking the Tanno, the Spiritwalkers. They are said to have collected ancient records from as far back as the First Empire.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes.’ Icarium nodded. ‘I have heard that said, too. Think of all that secret knowledge! Tell me, do you think the priests will permit me entry to their libraries? There is so much I need to learn – why would they stop me? Do you think they will be kind, friend? Kind to me?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMappo studied the shards on the road. ‘The Tanno are said to be very wise, Icarium. I do not imagine they would bar their doors to you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Good. That’s good.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Trell scratched at the bristle on his jaw. ‘So, it shall be Icarium and Mappo, walking across the wastes, all the way to the coast, there to take ship to the island, to the home of the Spiritwalkers.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Icarium and Mappo,’ the Jhag repeated, and then he smiled. ‘Mappo, my friend, this seems a most promising day, does it not?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I shall draw water from the caravan wells, and then we can be on our way.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Water,’ said Icarium. ‘Yes, so I can wash this mud off – I seem to have bathed in it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You slid down a bank yesterday evening.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Just so, Mappo. Clumsy of me.’ He slowly straightened, cupped in his hands a score of fragments. ‘See the beautiful blue glaze? Like the sky itself – they must have been beautiful, these vessels. It is such a loss, when precious things break, isn’t it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, Icarium, a terrible loss.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Mappo?’ He lifted eyes sharp with anguish. ‘In the city, I think, something happened. Thousands have died – thousands lie dead in that city – it’s true, isn’t it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, Icarium, a most tragic end.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What awful curse was visited upon it, do you think?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMappo shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIcarium studied the shards in his hands. ‘If I could put it all back together, I would. You know that, don’t you? You understand that – please, say that you understand.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-124.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
