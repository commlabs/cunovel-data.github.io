Even when you go to the lavatory.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnat shrugged. He glanced at me as if looking for sympathy and growled to himself:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That\u0027s discrimination . . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We\u0027re not in the States,\u0027 the boss said, his voice becoming dangerously polite. \u0027Yes, it\u0027s discrimination. Making use of the most appropriate available member of staff without taking his personal inclinations into account.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Couldn\u0027t I take that assignment?\u0027 Garik asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat released the tension immediately. Garik\u0027s incredibly bad luck with women was no secret. Someone laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Igor and Garik, you carry on looking for the female vampire.\u0027 The boss almost seemed to have taken the suggestion seriously. \u0027She needs blood. She was stopped at the last minute, so she\u0027s going insane with hunger and frustration. Expect new victims at any moment. Anton, you and Olga look for the boy.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was clear enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, the most pointless and least significant assignment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere in the city there was an Inferno waiting to erupt, somewhere in the city there was a wild, hungry female vampire, and I had to go looking for a kid who might, potentially, possess great magical powers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Permission to proceed?\u0027 I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes, of course,\u0027 said the boss, ignoring my quiet hint of revolt. \u0027Proceed.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swung round and left the Twilight as a sign of protest. The world flickered as it filled with colours and sounds. I was left standing there on my own in the middle of the square. To any outsider watching it would have looked really crazy. And then there were no footprints ... I was standing in a snowdrift, surrounded by a shroud of virgin snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s how myths are born. Out of our carelessness, out of our tattered nerves, out of jokes that go wrong and flashy gestures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s okay,\u0027 I said and set off straight for the avenue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Thank you ...\u0027 a gentle voice whispered affectionately in my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027For what, Olga?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027For not forgetting about me.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It really is that important to you to succeed in this, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes, it is,\u0027 the bird answered after a pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Then we\u0027ll try really hard.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI skipped over the snowdrifts and some stones lying around – a glacier must have passed that way, or maybe someone had been playing at Zen gardens – and came out on to the avenue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Have you any cognac?\u0027 asked Olga.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Cognac . . . yes. Why?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Good cognac?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s never bad. If it\u0027s genuine cognac, that is.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlga sniffed scornfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Then why don\u0027t you offer a lady coffee with cognac?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pictured to myself an owl drinking cognac out of a saucer and almost laughed out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Certainly. Shall we take a taxi?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t push it, kid!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHmm. Just when had she been locked into that bird\u0027s body? Or maybe it didn\u0027t stop her reading books?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There\u0027s such a thing as television,\u0027 the bird whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDark and Light! I\u0027d been certain my thoughts were safely concealed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Experience of life is an excellent substitute for vulgar telepathy . . . a long experience of life,\u0027 Olga went on slyly. \u0027Your thoughts are closed to me, Anton. And anyway, you\u0027re my partner.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I wasn\u0027t really . . .\u0027 I gave up. It was stupid to deny the obvious. \u0027And what about the boy? Are we just dropping the assignment? It\u0027s not all that serious . . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s very serious,\u0027 Olga exclaimed indignantly. \u0027Anton, the boss has admitted that he made a mistake. He\u0027s given us a headstart, and we\u0027ve got to make the most of it. The girl vampire is focused on the boy, don\u0027t you see? For her he\u0027s like a sandwich she never got to eat, it was just taken right out of her mouth. And he\u0027s still on her leash. Now she can lure him into her lair from any side of the city. But that gives us an advantage. Why go looking for a tiger in the jungle, when you can tether a goat out in a clearing?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Moscow\u0027s just full of goats like that . . .\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027This boy is on her leash. She\u0027s an inexperienced vampire. Establishing contact with a new victim is harder than attracting an old one. Trust me.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered, trying to shake off a foolish suspicion. I raised my hand to stop a car and said sombrely:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I trust you. Absolutely and completely.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 4\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE OWL emerged from the Twilight the moment I stepped inside the door. She launched into the air – for just an instant I felt the light prick of her claws – and headed for the fridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Maybe I ought to make you a perch?\u0027 I asked, locking the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time I saw how Olga spoke. Her beak twitched and she forced the words out with obvious effort. To be honest, I still don\u0027t understand how a bird can talk. Especially in such a human voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Better not, or I\u0027ll start laying eggs.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was obviously an attempt at a joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Sorry, I didn\u0027t mean to offend you,\u0027 I replied. \u0027I was just trying to lighten things up.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I understand. It\u0027s all right.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rummaged in the fridge and discovered a few odd bits and pieces. Cheese, salami, pickles ... I wondered how forty-year-old cognac would go with a lightly salted cucumber. They\u0027d probably find each other\u0027s company a bit awkward. The way Olga and I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took out the cheese and the salami.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I don\u0027t have any lemons, sorry.\u0027 I realised just how absurd all these preparations were, but still. . . \u0027At least it\u0027s a decent cognac.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe owl didn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the bottle of Kutuzov out of the drawer in the table that I used as a bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Ever tried this?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Our reply to Napoleon?\u0027 the owl asked with a laugh. \u0027No, I haven\u0027t.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe situation just kept getting more and more ridiculous. I rinsed out two cognac glasses and put them on the table, glancing doubtfully at the bundle of white feathers. At the short, crooked beak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You can\u0027t drink from a glass. Maybe I should get you a saucer.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Look the other way.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did as she said. There was a rustling of feathers behind my back. Then a faint, unpleasant hissing sound that reminded me of a snake that\u0027s just been woken up, or gas escaping from a cylinder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Olga, I\u0027m sorry, but. . .\u0027 I said as I turned round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe owl wasn\u0027t there any more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure, I\u0027d been expecting something like this. I\u0027d been hoping she was allowed to assume human form sometimes at least. And in my mind I\u0027d drawn this portrait of Olga, a woman imprisoned in the body of a bird, a woman who remembers the Decembrist uprising. I\u0027d had this picture of Princess Lopukhina running away from the ball. Only a bit older and more serious, with a wise look in her eyes, a bit thinner . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the woman sitting on the stool was young, in fact she was really young. About twenty-five. Hair cut short like a man\u0027s, dirt on her cheeks, as if she\u0027d just escaped from a fire. Beautiful, with finely moulded, aristocratic features. But that dirty soot . . . that crude, ugly haircut . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final shock was the way she was dressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStained army trousers 1940s style, a padded jacket, unbuttoned, over a dirty-grey soldier\u0027s shirt. Bare feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Am I beautiful?\u0027 the woman asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes, as a matter of fact, you are,\u0027 I replied. \u0027Light and Dark . . . why do you look that way?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The last time I assumed human form was fifty-five years ago.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I get it. They used you in the war.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027They use me in every war,\u0027 Olga said with a sweet smile. \u0027In every serious war. At any other time I\u0027m forbidden to assume human form.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There\u0027s no war on now.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Then there\u0027s going to be one.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t smile that time. I restrained my oath and just made the sign to ward off misfortune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Do you want to have a shower?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027d love to.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I don\u0027t have any woman\u0027s clothes . . . will jeans and a shirt do?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. She got up – moving awkwardly, waving her arms bizarrely and looking down in surprise at her own bare feet. But she managed to walk to the bathroom as if it wasn\u0027t the first time she\u0027d taken a shower at my place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made a dash for the bedroom. She probably didn\u0027t have much time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pair of old jeans one size smaller than I wear now. They\u0027ll still be too big for her ... A shirt? No, better a thin sweater. Underwear . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Anton!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raked the clothes into a heap, grabbed a clean towel and dashed back out. The bathroom door was open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What kind of tap is this?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s foreign, a ball mechanism . . . just a moment.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went in. Olga was standing naked in the bath with her back to me, turning the lever of the tap left and right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Up,\u0027 I said. \u0027You lift it up for pressure. Left for cold, right for hot.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Okay. Thanks.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t even slightly embarrassed. Not surprising, considering her age and rank . . . even if she no longer held one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I felt embarrassed. So I tried to act casual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Here are the clothes. Maybe you can pick something out. That is, if you need anything.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Thank you, Anton ...\u0027 Olga looked at me. \u0027Take no notice. I\u0027ve spent eighty years in a bird\u0027s body. Hibernating most of the time, but I\u0027ve still had more than enough.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes were deep, fascinating. Dangerous eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I don\u0027t think of myself as a human, or an Other, or a woman any longer. Or as an owl, either, come to that. Just ... a bitter, sexless old fool who can sometimes talk.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe water spurted from the shower. Olga slowly raised her arms and turned round, revelling in the sensation of the firm jets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Washing off this soot is more important to me than . . . the embarrassment of an attractive young man.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed the \u0027young man\u0027 without argument and left the bathroom. I shook my head, picked up the cognac and opened the bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing at least was clear: she was no werewolf. A werewolf wouldn\u0027t have kept the clothes on its body. Olga was a magician. A female magician about two hundred years old who\u0027d been punished eighty years ago by being deprived of her body, but still hoped for a chance to redeem herself. She was a specialist in conflicts involving physical force and the last time she\u0027d been used for a job had been about fifty years earlier . . . \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-10.html","bookId":2623,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM"}
