The years after graduation hardened me into someone quite different from the strutting graduate who left campus that day headed for New York City, ready to offer the world his talent.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe world, I discovered, was not all that interested. I wandered around my early twenties, paying rent and reading classifieds and wondering why the lights were not turning green for me. My dream was to be a famous musician (I played the piano), but after several years of dark, empty nightclubs, broken promises, bands that kept breaking up and producers who seemed excited about everyone but me, the dream soured. I was failing for the first time in my life.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, I had my first serious encounter with death. My favorite uncle, my mother\u0027s brother, the man who had taught me music, taught me to drive, teased me about girls, thrown me a football-that one adult whom I targeted as a child and said, \"That\u0027s who I want to be when I grow up\"-died of pancreatic cancer at the age of forty-four. He was a short, handsome man with a thick mustache, and I was with him for the last year of his life, living in an apartment just below his. I watched his strong body wither, then bloat, saw him suffer, night after night, doubled over at the dinner table, pressing on his stomach, his eyes shut, his mouth contorted in pain. \"Ahhhhh, God,\" he would moan. \"Ahhhhhh, Jesus!\" The rest of us-my aunt, his two young sons, me-stood there, silently, cleaning the plates, averting our eyes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was the most helpless I have ever felt in my life. One night in May, my uncle and I sat on the balcony of his apartment. It was breezy and warm. He looked out toward the horizon and said, through gritted teeth, that he wouldn\u0027t be around to see his kids into the next school year. He asked if I would look after them. I told him not to talk that way. He stared at me sadly.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe died a few weeks later.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAfter the funeral, my life changed. I felt as if time were suddenly precious, water going down an open drain, and I could not move quickly enough. No more playing music at half-empty night clubs. No more writing songs in my apartment, songs that no one would hear. I returned to school. I earned a master\u0027s degree in journalism and took the first job offered, as a sports writer. Instead of chasing my own fame, I wrote about famous athletes chasing theirs. I worked for newspapers and freelanced for magazines. I worked at a pace that knew no hours, no limits. I would wake up in the morning, brush my teeth, and sit down at the typewriter in the same clothes I had slept in. My uncle had worked for a corporation and hated it-same thing, every day-and I was determined never to end up like him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI bounced around from New York to Florida and eventually took a job in Detroit as a columnist for the Detroit Free Press. The sports appetite in that city was insatiable-they had professional teams in football, basketball, baseball, and hockey-and it matched my ambition. In a few years, I was not only penning columns, I was writing sports books, doing radio shows, and appearing regularly on TV, spouting my opinions on rich football players and hypocritical college sports programs. I was part of the media thunderstorm that now soaks our country. I was in demand.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eI stopped renting. I started buying. I bought a house on a hill. I bought cars. I invested in stocks and built a portfolio. I was cranked to a fifth gear, and everything I did, I did on a deadline. I exercised like a demon. I drove my car at breakneck speed. I made more money than I had ever figured to see. I met a dark-haired woman named Janine who somehow loved me despite my schedule and the constant absences. We married after a seven year courtship. I was back to work a week after the wedding. I told her-and myself-that we would one day start a family, something she wanted very much. But that day never came.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eInstead, I buried myself in accomplishments, because with accomplishments, I believed I could control things, I could squeeze in every last piece of happiness before I got sick and died, like my uncle before me, which I figured was my natural fate.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs for Morrie? Well, I thought about him now and then, the things he had taught me about \"being human\" and \"relating to others,\" but it was always in the distance, as if from another life. Over the years, I threw away any mail that came from Brandeis University, figuring they were only asking for money. So I did not know of Morrie\u0027s illness. The people who might have told me were long forgotten, their phone numbers buried in some packed-away box in the attic.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt might have stayed that way, had I not been flicking through the TV channels late one night, when something caught my ear . . .\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e  \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/260/2455.html","bookId":229,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 7:23:54 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 7:23:54 AM"}
