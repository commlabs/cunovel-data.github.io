His madness awakens so fast, so utterly fast, that I might have failed – and after killing me his rage would have sought a new target, and many others would have died .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere really was no choice. There never was. Is it any wonder I am so tired?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flies swarmed him in a thick, glittering cloud. They sought out his eyes, but those had closed to slits. They spun round his mouth, but the gusts of breath from his nostrils drove them off. His people had been herders. They understood flies. He ignored their seething embrace. It meant nothing, and on he ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then my death would have made my loved ones grieve, and there is nothing pleasant in grieving. It is hot and dry to the touch. It is weakness taken inside. It can rise up and drown a life. No, I am glad I never found a wife, never fathered children. I could not bear to be the cause of their sorrow .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow can one give so freely of love to another, when the final outcome is one of betrayal? When one must leave the other – to be the betrayer who dies, to be the betrayed left alive. How can this be an even exchange, with death waiting at the end?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran, and time passed. The sun tracked across half the sky. The warm ache in his legs had shaken off the torment of his thoughts again and again, leading him into a world emptied of everything. How perfect is running? This grand delusion of flight? Away from our demons, ever away, until even the self sobs loose, spins lost in our wake .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerfect, oh yes. And a thing to despise. No distance can win an escape; no speed can outrun this self and all its host of troubles. It’s only the sweet exhaustion that follows that we so cherish. An exhaustion so pure it is as close to dying as we can get without actually doing so .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoets could speak knowingly of metaphors; if life is walking, then running is a life’s entire span speeded up, and to act out birth to death in a single day, over and over again, has the flavour of perfect habit, for it mimicks undeniable truths. Small deaths paying homage to the real one. We choose them in myriad forms and delight in the ritual. I could run until I wear out. Every joint, every bone and every muscle. I could run until my heart groans older than its years, and finally bursts .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could damn the poets and make the metaphor real. We are all self-destructive. It is integral to our nature. And we will run even when there’s nowhere to run to, and nothing terrible to run from. Why? Because to walk is just as meaningless. It just takes longer .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the screen of whizzing flies he saw something in the sky ahead. A darker cloud, a towering, swirling thing. Dust storm? There was no dust. A whirlwind? Maybe. But the air was still. It was in his path, although still some distance away. He watched it, to track its path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cloud remained directly ahead. Just bigger .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s coming straight at me .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore flies?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe insects surrounding him were suddenly frenzied – and he caught something in their manic buzzing. You’re part of this, aren’t you? The finders of life. And once found, you … summon .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could hear that cloud now, a deeper, more frightening drone quickly overwhelming the swarming flies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocusts .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that makes no sense. There is nothing for them to eat. There is nothing here at all .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this felt wrong. Mappo slowed his run, halted. The flies spun round him a moment longer, and then fled. He stood, breathing deep, eyes on the vast spinning pillar of locusts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, all at once, he understood. ‘ D’ivers .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething that looked like white foam was spreading from the base of the locust cloud, surging in tumultuous waves. Gods below. Butterflies . ‘You’re all d’ivers. You’re all one thing, one creature – the flies, the locusts, the butterflies – and this desert is where you live.’ He recalled the bones upon the edge. ‘This desert … is what you made.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe butterflies reached him, whipped round him – so many he could no longer see the ground at his feet. The frantic breaths of their wings stole the sweat from his skin, until he began shivering. ‘D’ivers! I would speak to you! Semble! Show yourself to me!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe locusts blighted half the sky, devouring the sun. Spinning overhead, and then, in a wave of rage, descending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMappo dropped to his knees, buried his face beneath his arms, hunched down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey struck his back like a deluge of darts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs more poured down, he grunted at their weight. Bones creaked. He struggled for breath, clenched his jaws against the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe locusts stabbed again and again with their jaws, driven mad by the feel and scent of living flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was Trell, and his kind had skin like leather. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-202.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
