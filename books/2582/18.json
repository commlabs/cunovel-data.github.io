That’s Sister Shanti’s traveling bag on her bed. Think they went out for a walk? A day trip or something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom shook his head. “No … looks like they just got up and walked out.” He knelt and picked up a pair of reading glasses. One of the lenses was cracked from side to side. “Brother David’s.” He frowned. “And there’s more. I sent a load of supplies here. Carpet coats, tents, cooking gear, extra rations, and some weapons. I don’t see any of it here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened and Lilah came in. “Someone broke the lock on Old Roger’s shed. He’s gone … tracks lead east.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How long?” asked Tom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Late morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom nodded again. “I think that’s when everyone left.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stood in the dusty sunlight, thinking that through, silently letting the implications shout at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay … we don’t have enough daylight left to get back to town,” said Tom, “and I sure as hell don’t want to sleep up in the hills tonight. Too many weird things going on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll second that,” mumbled Benny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So we have two choices. We hole up here and fortify this place, or we push on to Sunset Hollow. If we run most of the way, we can make it by full dark.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny was already shaking his head. Sunset Hollow was where he and Tom had lived before First Night. It was where the zombies of their parents had been kept by Tom for fourteen years; and it was where they were buried now. On one hand it had a high wall and a fence they could lock; on the other hand, Benny was sure that if he went back there he would go totally ape crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nix can’t do all that running,” he said, fishing for a reasonable excuse. “And Chong has to go home tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t make this about me,” said Nix defiantly. “I’ll outrun your narrow butt any day of the week, Benny Imura.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny winced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay here,” voted Lilah. “Five of us can hold this place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s no back exit,” Tom replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLilah considered that and said nothing. She turned and looked at the others, then frowned. “Where is Chong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all turned to the door, each of them realizing that Chong had not come inside with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was he outside when you checked around back?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded but immediately rushed outside. Tom was a half step behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChong was nowhere in sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e29\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“THIS DAY CANNOT GET ANY WORSE,” TOM SAID UNDER HIS BREATH.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny shot him a look. It was the kind of statement that he would never dare make because the universe always seemed to take it as a challenge. He cupped his hands and called Chong’s name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe echoes bounced around and came back empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, come on,” growled Tom with mounting frustration. “Somebody that smart can’t possibly be this dumb.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe he went somewhere to go to the bathroom,” suggested Benny. “Chong’s pretty shy about that stuff … so maybe he—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Went to the bathroom where? In his damn parents’ house? There’s an outhouse twenty feet away, and there are bushes everywhere he could squat behind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was pretty upset,” said Nix. “Maybe he just wanted to be alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom turned to her and gave her a long, withering stare. “Alone? In the Rot and bloody Ruin?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flushed bright red and immediately started calling Chong’s name again. Tom did too. Only Lilah stayed silent. Her damaged larynx made it impossible for her to shout loud enough to do any good; but her honey-colored eyes missed nothing as she turned in a full circle and surveyed the surrounding forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLilah shot Nix an evil look. “Are all boys this stupid?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey!” said Benny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNix didn’t answer. She called Chong’s name again, shouting it as loud as she could, even though it hurt her injury to do it. If he could hear the shouts, Chong did not answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom cursed with great vehemence for several seconds. “I am so going to kill him. I’m going to drag him back to town and chain him to his own front porch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll help,” offered Benny, who was as angry as he was scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom looked from the tree line to the sun and back again. “Damn it.” He turned to the others. “Okay, everyone spread out. Find Chong’s footprints. He has those wedge-soled boots. Keep your weapons in hand and stay in sight with at least one other person. You find anything, call out. Go!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four of them moved away from the front of the station as if they were propelled outward by an explosion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s gone, whispered Benny’s inner voice. Be prepared for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny didn’t want to believe it, but his mind was replaying his last conversation with Chong, and Chong’s last words: “I should never have come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, you monkey-banger,” Benny muttered aloud as he scanned the dusty ground and picked his way through the broken concrete. “Stop screwing around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he found something that froze the blood in his veins. He straightened and yelled as loud as he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“HERE!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone came running. Benny saw the flash of sunlight on Tom’s sword as his brother ran up from his left, and the glitter on the wicked edge of Lilah’s spear as she closed in from the right. Nix came puffing up behind him. They all stopped and stared. No one said a word. The words had already been said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were scraped onto the side of a slab of concrete pushed almost vertical by tree roots. Chong had left them a message. Two words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’M SORRY.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny looked at what lay beyond the slab of concrete. Miles of white rock left by a glacier. White rock baking in the sunlight. The row of rocks split off into five separate threads that led high into the mountains and vanished into the gloom gathering under the forest canopy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny remembered a basic fact of tracking that Tom had taught him: Rubber-soled shoes don’t leave tracks on rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were five possible trails, and there were four of them. The sun was already behind the treetops, and it would be dark in two hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a feeling of sinking horror, Benny realized that Chong, smart as ever, had picked a path away from them that was impossible to follow. In grief and shame, he had run away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was nothing they could do about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e30\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLOU CHONG RAN AS FAST AS HE COULD OVER THE ROCKS. HIS HEART pounded, but it also ached. Benny would hate him for this. So would Nix and Tom. Lilah, however … well, Chong figured that Lilah would be happy to have him gone. Lilah despised weakness, and Chong felt that “weak” had quickly become his defining characteristic. At least out here in the Ruin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt stupid and ashamed. He should never have agreed to come, and though he briefly thought that Tom was just as much to blame for even suggesting this trip, Chong believed the stuff that had gone wrong was all his own fault. He was fairly certain that Tom was on the verge of turning back, which meant that Chong would be responsible for screwing up what Nix and Benny really wanted. And for denying Lilah the freedom that she craved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the process of logic that had spurred him to run, though now, deep in the woods, he could see that the logic was as thin as tissue paper and filled with holes. He remembered one of his father’s countless lessons about logical thinking: “When you add emotion to any equation, you can’t trust the results.” Shame and guilt were emotions, and the sum at the end of his logical calculations was as untrustworthy as his actions back on the road when the rhino first appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not cut out for the Ruin,” he told himself as he ran. “I’m nobody’s idea of Mr. Adventure.” His words were pitched to sound funny, but his heart was breaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he ran he made himself remember everything that Mr. Feeney had taught them in the Scouts and what he had read in books about the forests of the Sierra Nevadas. All the tricks about tracking and stalking. And about how to foil pursuit. There was a lot of that in books. The Leatherstocking Tales and old Louis L’Amour novels from long before First Night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChong knew about doubling back and leaving false trails. He knew how to circle around and cut his own trail. He knew how to keep from scuffing the rocks. Several times he jumped down from the rocks and ran into the tall grass, then carefully walked backward in his own footprints so that anyone following would think he ran into the field. When he reached the forest, he found a broken branch that still had some leaves on it, and as he ran he whisked the ground behind him to wipe out his trail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe Tom or Lilah could find him, but he didn’t think so. If they were alone and had all the time in the world, sure … but they had to watch out for Benny and Nix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChong even smiled to himself with how clever he was being. It felt good to do something right, even if the others would hate him for it. Better that than having them hurt again because of him. Especially if Charlie Pink-eye was still alive. It would be better for Benny and the others to keep going east, to get far beyond the reach of that maniac.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChong knew enough about orienteering to know which way was northwest. And even though he hated physical exertion, he could climb a tree and lash himself to the trunk to wait out the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it grew dark he slowed to a walk. The canopy of leaves was so dense he could catch only glimpses of the sky. Sunset couldn’t be more than an hour and a half away. It was time to find shelter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw an upslope and took that, reasoning that high ground would give him a better view to help him pick a likely tree for the night, and allow him to see if he was indeed alone in this section of the forest. Chong was sure he could outrun a zom, but if one came after him, the creature would simply follow him to whatever tree he chose and stand there until the world ended. It could outwait him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No thanks,” he told himself, and almost jumped at the sound of his own voice. He drew his bokken. He was not as strong a swordsman as Benny, or as fast as Nix, but Chong knew that he was far from helpless, and holding the weapon recharged his confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the top of the hill he turned in a full circle. Shadows clustered around the base of each tree, and every time the wind blew Chong imagined he could see a ghastly shape lumbering his way. But he saw no zoms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spotted a stately cottonwood tree with a couple of branches low enough to grab and many more high up among the leaves. He ran down the hill and began climbing the slope atop of which was the cottonwood. He looked left and right, checking his surroundings, filling his mind with data, being smart and careful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he walked right past the two figures standing in the dense shadows beneath a massive old spruce. They, however, saw him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom, Lilah, Nix, and Benny were miles away. Much too far away to hear Lou Chong’s screams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e31\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBENNY STOPPED AS MOVEMENT CAUGHT HIS EYE FAR TO THE NORTH. A flock of birds leaped out of the distant trees like a cloud of locusts. They swirled and eddied in the air and then gradually settled back down among the dark green leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was that?” asked Nix, catching the sudden jerk of Benny’s head but missing what he was looking at. She was kneeling among the rocks sixty yards from the way station, trying to determine if a smudge could be one of Chong’s footprints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just some birds,” he said. Even so, Benny continued to stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLilah climbed up on the rocks from the other side. “Where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny pointed. The trees were still for a five count, and then the birds jumped up again. As a swarm they moved a hundred yards south and settled in different trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lilah,” Benny asked, “d’you think—?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he could finish, Lilah turned and clapped her hands over her head several times to attract Tom’s attention. He was on the far side of the station, but he came at a run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny described what they’d seen. Tom didn’t immediately reply. He looked at the sun again and the long shadows cast by the western line of trees, then he turned and studied the area where Lilah had pointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s got to be Chong,” decided Tom. “Direction’s right. Could be heading for the northern trade route.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” Benny agreed. Tom had made them study every route and path in the Ruin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNix chewed her lip. “Tom, do you think Chong’s trying to go back home?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure. Where else would he go? The question has always been how. There are fifty ways to get to Mountainside from here, and all we know for sure is that he isn’t going the way we came.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Preacher Jack’s out there too,” said Nix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom didn’t reply, but the muscles at the corners of his jaw bunched and flexed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“C’mon,” cried Benny, grabbing at his bokken. “What are we waiting for? Let’s go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, kiddo,” said Tom, “but you and Nix would slow me down too much. It’s going to be dark soon, and I’m a lot faster alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was true, but Benny tried to come up with an argument to get around it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll go,” said Lilah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom shook his head. “No. You’re tough, Lilah, but I can’t allow it.” Lilah stiffened at the word “allow,” but Tom didn’t back down. “I admit that you’re good. You survived out here for years … but I’m still better at this. I’m bigger and faster, and I’ve been hunting these mountains for fourteen years. Besides, the Chongs left their son in my care. This is my fault, and it’s mine to make right. I also don’t want to argue about this. I want you to stay here with Nix and Benny. You can help them fortify this place. Remember, Sally Two-Knives is due through here tonight, and J-Dog and Dr. Skillz are in the area. Wait for them. Are we agreed?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dust-and-decay-benny-imura-2/page-18.html","bookId":2582,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:52 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:52 PM"}
