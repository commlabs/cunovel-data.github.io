His final task had been the punctured tire. He had used the car jack from the Rolls-Royce to lift the aircraft, then he had taken the wheel to the nearest garage and paid a mechanic to repair the tire. He had devised a method of refueling in flight, knocking out a cabin window and passing a hose through it and into the petrol filler pipe. Finally he had unfolded the wings, fixing them in flying position with the simple steel pins provided. Now the aircraft filled the width of the church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked outside. It was a calm day, with a light wind, and patchy low cloud that would serve to hide the Hornet Moth from the Luftwaffe. They would go tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis stomach clenched with anxiety when he thought of it. Simply circling the Vodal training school in a Tiger Moth had seemed like a hair-raising adventure. Now he was planning to fly hundreds of miles over the open sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn aircraft such as this should hug the coast, so that it could glide to land in case of trouble. Flying to England from here, it was theoretically possible to follow the coastlines of Denmark, Germany, Holland, Belgium, and France. But Harald and Karen would be many miles out to sea, well away from German-occupied land. If anything went wrong, they would have nowhere to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarald was still worrying when Karen slipped through the window, carrying a basket like Little Red Riding Hood. His heart leaped with pleasure at the sight of her. All day, as he worked on the aircraft, he had thought about the way they had kissed early this morning, after stealing the petrol. He kept touching his lips with his fingertips to bring back the memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she looked at the Hornet Moth and said, \"Wow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was pleased to have impressed her. \"Pretty, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you can\u0027t get it through the door like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I\u0027ll have to fold the wings again, then unfold them outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why have you rigged them now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For practice. I\u0027ll be able to do it faster the second time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How fast?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the soldiers? If they see us . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll be asleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked solemn. \"We\u0027re ready, aren\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re ready.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When shall we go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tonight, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Waiting just increases the chance that we\u0027ll be found out before we get away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, but . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose I just didn\u0027t think it would come so quickly.\" She took a package out of her basket and handed it to him absentmindedly. \"I brought you some cold beef.\" She fed him every night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\" He studied her carefully. \"You\u0027re not having second thoughts, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head decisively. \"No. I\u0027m just remembering that it\u0027s three years since I sat in a pilot\u0027s seat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went over to the workbench and selected a small hatchet and a ball of stout cord. He stowed them in the locker under the dashboard of the aircraft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren said, \"What are they for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we come down in the sea, I figure the aircraft will sink, because of the weight of the engine. But the wings on their own would float. So if we could chop the wings off, we could lash them together for a makeshift raft.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the North Sea? I think we\u0027d die of cold before long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s better than drowning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shivered. \"If you say so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We ought to take some biscuits and a couple of bottles of water.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get some from the kitchen. Speaking of water . . . we\u0027re going to be in the air for more than six hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do we pee?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open the door and hope for the best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all right for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked around and picked up a handful of old newspapers. \"Put these inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In case I have to pee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. \"I don\u0027t see how . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pray that you never have to find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put the newspapers on the seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do we have any maps?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I assumed we would just fly west until we see land, and that will be England.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"It\u0027s quite difficult to know where you are in the air. I used to get lost just flying around here. Suppose we get blown off course? We could come down in France by mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My God, I didn\u0027t think of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The only way to check your position is to compare the terrain features below you with a map. I\u0027ll see what we\u0027ve got in the house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d better go and get all the stuff we need.\" She slipped out through the window again, carrying the empty basket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarald was too tense to eat the beef she had brought him. He began to refold the wings. The process was quick, by design: the intention was that the gentleman owner would do this every night, and garage the aircraft alongside the family car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo prevent the upper wing fouling the cabin roof when the wings were folded, the inner section of the trailing edge was hinged to swing up out of the way. So Harald\u0027s first step was to unlock the hinged sections and push them up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the underside of each upper wing was stowed a brace, called a jury strut, which Harald detached then fixed between the inner ends of the upper and lower wings, to prevent their collapsing together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wings were held in the flying position by L-shaped sliding pins in the front spars of all four wings. On the upper wings, the pin was locked in place by the jury strut, which Harald had now removed, so all he had to do was turn the pin through ninety degrees and pull it forward about four inches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pins on the lower wings were locked in place by leather straps. Harald undid the strap on the left wing, then turned the pin and pulled it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as it came free, the wing started to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarald realized he should have expected this. In its parked position, with its tail on the ground, the aircraft was tilted, with its nose in the air; and now the heavy double wing was swinging backward by force of gravity. He grabbed at it, terrified that it would crash against the fuselage and cause damage. He tried to seize the leading edge of the lower wing, but it was too thick for him to get a grasp. \"Shit!\" he cried. He stepped forward, chasing the wing, and grabbed at the steel rigging wires between upper and lower wings. He got a purchase, and slowed the swing, then the wire bit into the skin of his hand. He cried out and automatically let go. The wing swiveled back and came to rest with a painful thud against the fuselage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCursing his carelessness, Harald went to the tail, took hold of the lower wingtip in both hands, and swung it out so that he could check for damage. To his intense relief there seemed to be none. The trailing edges of the upper and lower wings were intact, and the fuselage was unmarked. Nothing was broken but the skin of Harald\u0027s right hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLicking the blood from his palm, he went to the right side. This time he braced the lower wing with a tea chest full of old magazines, so that it could not move. He pulled the pins, then walked around the wing, shoved the chest out of the way, and held the wing, allowing it to swing slowly back into the folded position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaren came back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you get everything?\" Harald said anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dropped her basket on the floor. \"We can\u0027t go tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" He felt cheated. He had got scared for nothing. \"Why not?\" he said angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m dancing tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dancing?\" He was outraged. \"How can you put that before our mission?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s really special. I told you I\u0027ve been understudying the lead role. Half the company has gone down with some kind of gastric illness. There are two casts, but the leads in both are sick, so I\u0027ve been called in. It\u0027s a great piece of luck!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn bad luck, it seems to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be on the main stage at the Royal Theatre, and guess what? The King will be there!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran his fingers through his hair distractedly. \"I can\u0027t believe you\u0027re saying this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I reserved a ticket for you. You can pick it up at the box office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be so grumpy! We can fly tomorrow night, after I dance. The ballet isn\u0027t on again for another week after that, and one of the other two is sure to be better by then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care about the damn ballet - what about the war? Heis reckoned the RAF must be planning a massive air raid. They need our photographs before then! Think of the lives at stake!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed, and her voice softened. \"I knew you would feel this way, and I thought about forgoing the opportunity, but I just can\u0027t. Anyway, if we fly tomorrow, we\u0027ll be in England three days before the full moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we\u0027ll be in deadly danger here for an extra twenty-four hours!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, no one knows about this plane - why would they find out tomorrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, don\u0027t be so childish, anything\u0027s possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Childish? The police are looking for me, you know that. I\u0027m a fugitive and I want to get out of this country as soon as I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she was getting angry. \"You really ought to understand how I feel about this performance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, I might die in this damn plane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So might I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"While I\u0027m drowning in the North Sea, or freezing to death on your makeshift raft, I\u0027d like to be able to think that before I died I achieved my life\u0027s ambition, and danced wonderfully on the stage of the Royal Danish Theatre in front of the King. Can\u0027t you understand that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I can\u0027t!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you can go to hell,\" she said, and she went out through the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarald stared after her. He was thunderstruck. A minute passed before he moved. Then he looked inside the basket she had brought. There were two bottles of mineral water, a packet of crackers, a flashlight, a spare battery, and two spare bulbs. There were no maps, but she had put in an old school atlas. He picked up the book and opened it. On the endpaper was written, in a girlish hand, \"Karen Duchwitz, Class 3.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, hell,\" he said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hornet-flight/page-28.html","bookId":2680,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:28 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:28 AM"}
