You just watch me, I will.’ He waited a moment, as they walked side by side through the camp, and then asked, ‘Sir, if there’s something we can’t handle how do we handle it anyway?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe either grunted or laughed from the same place that grunts came from. ‘Sawtooth wedges and keep going, Beak. Throw back whatever is thrown at us. Keep going, until…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Until what?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It’s all right, Beak, to die alongside your comrades. It’s all right. Do you understand me?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes sir, I do. It is all right, because they’re my friends.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That’s right, Beak.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that’s why no-one needs to worry, Captain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeneb watched as his marines fell into formation. Fast march, now, as if these poor souls weren’t beat enough. But they couldn’t dart and hide any more. The enemy had turned the game round and they had the advantage in numbers and maybe, finally, they were also a match for the ferocity of his Malazans.,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been inevitable. No empire just rolls over, legs splaying. After enough pokes and jabs, it turns and snarls and then the fangs sink deep. And now it was his marines who were doing the bleeding. But not nearly as bad as I’d feared. Look at them, Keneb. Looking meaner than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Fist,’ Thorn Tissy said beside him, ‘they’re ready for you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I see that, Sergeant.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No sir. I meant, they’re ready.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeneb met the squat man’s dark, beady eyes, and wasn’t sure what he saw in them. Whatever it was, it burned bright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sir,’ Thorn Tissy said, ‘it’s what we’re meant for. All’-he waved one grimy hand-‘this. Trained to play more than one game, right? We stuck ‘em enough to get ‘em riled up and so here they are, all those damned Edur drawn right to us like we was a lodestone. Now we’re about to knock ‘em off balance all over again, and Hood take me, it’s got my blood up! Same for us all! So, please, sir, sound us the order to march.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeneb stared at the man a moment longer, then he nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the sound of laughter, Koryk barrelled into the three Edur warriors, his heavy longsword hammering aside two of the out-thrust spears jabbing for his midsection. With his left hand he caught the shaft of the third one and used it to pull himself forward. Edge of his blade into the face of the warrior on his right-not deep enough to cause serious damage, but enough to spray blinding blood. Against the one in the middle, Koryk dropped one shoulder and hit him hard in the centre of his chest-hard enough to lift the Edur from his feet and send him sprawling back. Still gripping the third spear, Koryk twisted the warrior round and drove the point of his sword into the Edur’s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKoryk spun to slash at the first warrior, only to see her tumble back with a throwing knife skewering one eye socket. So he lunged after the middle Edur, sword chopping down in a frenzy until the Edur’s smashed-up arms-raised to fend off the attack-fell away, freeing the half-blood Seti to deliver a skull-crushing blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he whirled. ‘Will you in Hood’s name stop that laughing!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Smiles was on one knee, convulsing with hilarity even as she pulled out her throwing knife. ‘Gods! I can’t breathe! Wait-just wait-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnarling, Koryk turned to face the cloister again-these narrow-laned mews created perfect cul-de-sacs-lead them in at a run, flank out then turn and cut the bastards down. Even so, nobody had planned on making this ugly village the site of their last stand. Except maybe the Edur, who now entirely surrounded it and were working their way in, house by house, lane by lane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelt good kicking back, though, whenever they got too spread out in their eagerness to spill Malazan blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They stink at fighting in groups,’ Smiles said, coming up alongside him. She glanced up into his face and then burst out laughing again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What’s so funny?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You! Them! The look in their eyes-the surprise, I mean, oh, gods of the deep! I can’t stop!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You’d better,’ Koryk warned, shaking the blood from his sword. ‘I’m hearing movement-that lane mouth there-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecome on.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree quarrels flitted out, two of them taking down onrushing Edur. Two lances arced in retaliation, both darting straight for Fiddler. And then Tarr’s huge shield shifted into their path, and the sergeant was pushed hard to one side-grunts from the corporal as both lances slammed solidly against the bronze-scaled face, one of them punching through a finger’s length to pierce Tarr’s upper arm. The corporal swore. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-362.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
