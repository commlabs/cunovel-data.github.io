It was the fact that this dream world was constructed with his consciousness as the foundation and the weaknesses of each player was drawn upon what he knew of them. Which meant a critical flaw existed. This was the chance to bring the whole team back to reality!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(The answer to A Nightmare on Elm Street is as simple as overcoming the gap in your heart. However, words are easier said than done. How could any person stay indifferent to those closest to you, dearest to you, and the things that you regret the most in life? How could anyone overcome them and move forward in life so easily?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng pondered on his next actions. He had planned most of what he needed to do. He even set up his scheme. Now, all he had to do was wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(It\u0027s unfortunate for the newbies in this movie. They aren\u0027t even given the privilege to fight Freddy. The lack of strength meant getting killed the moment they encountered Freddy. I also don\u0027t know their weaknesses so Freddy didn\u0027t have to bother drawing them in using their weaknesses. Their deaths are unfortunate.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, a strange feeling rose within Zheng. He had sensed this feeling multiple times throughout this movie already, each time accompanied by the disappearance of one or more team members. This feeling was brought forth by Freddy\u0027s appearance. The dream world belonged to Zheng after all. He could sense it when Freddy entered his dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe few people upstairs were chatting as they were bored. Xuan was sitting on a sofa not far away from the group, reading a book. This whole day of nothingness was driving them crazy from the boredom. ChengXiao finally had enough of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it. I can\u0027t stand this anymore. I am going to buy a pack of pokers at the supermarket. It\u0027s boring sitting here anyway. Let\u0027s play some cards.\" He went straight for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTengYi and LiuYu looked at each other. They both wanted to stop ChengXiao since it was dangerous going out alone. They were the only people left in the team so things had become suspicious. Could it be that team China originally had many members like Zheng told them? And those members disappeared in this world? It would be dangerous for ChengXiao to go out alone if that was the case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, ChengXiao moved faster than they could speak. He was out the door before their words came out. The two watched as the door closed behind him. TengYi and LiuYu felt it was strange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChengXiao took a deep breath as he stepped outside then he exclaimed, \"Haha. Freedom at last. Man, this movie world is freaking strange and dense. If there really are ghosts or apparitions, we could at least fight them. But everyday we just wait in this house. Yet, nothing ever appears. It was killing me with boredom… Is it time to take a look at American blondes? Or should I look for one night stands from a nearby bar using my charisma?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChengXiao muttered to himself while he walked. He seemed like a mouse that just escaped his cage, heading toward the place that interested him the most. He soon reached the main streets of the town. The town was unfamiliar to him but his natural pervert intuitions quickly led him to bar. He pushed open the door and walked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe time was still early. Sun had just started setting so not many people were inside the bar. A few women in sexy make up, a few men in casual attires, and the staffs made up the composition of the bar. Soft music floated in the air and bestowed it with a peaceful and comfortable sensation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChengXiao scanned the room. There was no ladies by herself. He had no choice but to go to the counter and asked for a shot. He seated himself facing the entrance. Every woman who came in received his smile but every woman was also accompanied by their male friends. Before long, ChengXiao started cursing. Half an hour passed by and darkness would soon overtake the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to put down his glass and get ready to leave. He was planning to come back for the American blondes after dinner. More people should be here at night it couldn\u0027t be that everyone came as couples. He refused to believe in such purity in the American night life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight as ChengXiao got up, four girls came in through the door. They looked to be in their twenties, the age of youth. They were dressed in alluring clothes and make up but they looked quite decent. Even the least attractive one was quite pretty, and most importantly, she was Asian with black hair. ChengXiao\u0027s eyes lit up upon noticing her. Yet, as her face came into view, his face loss all color of blood. His hands trembled uncontrollably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender suddenly said to an American, \"Here they are again. These arrogant prostitutes come here before it\u0027s even night time. If they aren\u0027t paying their fees to the owner, we would have driven them out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChengXiao turned around. He drank the whole glass in one go then asked the bartender. \"Prostitutes? They all are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bartender didn\u0027t notice his abnormality. \"Yeah, they are all prostitutes. They came from war riddled places like the Middle East and poor Asian countries. These cheap women should have stayed in their own countries instead of coming to America and become prostitutes…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head turned in an unusual manner before he could finish talking. It was like a force was twisting a doll\u0027s head. ChengXiao twisted the bartender\u0027s head and lifted him by the neck. \"Don\u0027t fucking spill your garbage… and lies. Your mouth stinks!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tone of his voice felt lower in temperature with each word. He grabbed the bartender and smashed him at the counter, shattering the glass and wood. ChengXiao then placed his hand at the American next to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Freddy. I know you are attacking me. The gap in my heart? Even though I understand what it means to use whatever measure necessary at your enemy…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe punched repeatedly at the American man. His strikes were so fast that normal people could only see a flurry. The man\u0027s bones were crushed and dropped to the floor like a pile of dead meat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChengXiao howled and turned to the Asian girl. She looked identical to his childhood sweetheart. As the thought of her falling into such a state… that she got humiliated and insulted by people, he could barely contain the rage to kill everyone in the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, by the time he completely turned around, he saw a man in black hat and striped shirt holding her hand and walked out the bar. ChengXiao rushed out without thinking. He did not notice the man\u0027s face was burned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"ChengXiao disappeared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng sighed by the dining table. He looked over at everyone here. Team China only had four people left at this dinner, Xuan, TengYi, LiuYu and him. The pervert was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(What must come will come. The last person who I know of his weakness is gone. And then it should be… Don\u0027t know when will it began. Can TengYi complete this task?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng suddenly asked, \"Xuan, does the food taste good?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? They don\u0027t, huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng nodded. He then said to TengYi, \"TengYi… keep this in mind. Protect yourself. Never give up hope no matter what happens. Freddy is physically weaker than you if he can\u0027t enter the dream world. You have bathed in dragon blood and unlocked the first genetic constraint. You can easily take down a MMA fighter in the real world. So, believe in your own strength.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTengYi was surprised. He wasn\u0027t good with his words so he nodded and continued eating. A strange atmosphere floated above the dining table. After eating, Zheng drew out Tiger\u0027s Soul and pointed it at Xuan, just ten centimeters away from his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-18-chapter-11-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-18-chapter-11-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-18-chapter-11-02","bookId":1512,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:20 AM"}
