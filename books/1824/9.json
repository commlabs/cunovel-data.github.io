{"id":87949,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"Aunt Jane, I can\u0027t-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is an emergency. Your uncle and I are tapped out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard her uncle say, \"Tell her to stop arguing and do what she\u0027s told. The decision\u0027s been made.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison could feel a slow burn coming on. She had reached the sidewalk in front of the auditorium and was now pacing back and forth. Students were passing her on their way into the building. She stopped pacing for a second and noticed a man in a heavy overcoat with the collar turned up standing at the top of the steps. He was watching her. Dan\u0027s warning to be aware of her surroundings made her take notice, and she walked away from the steps as she continued to listen to her aunt\u0027s argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your uncle\u0027s right. We\u0027ve made the decision. Just remember, family comes first, and Will needs you. Don\u0027t be ungrateful after all we\u0027ve done for you and your sister-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe interrupted. \"Aunt Jane, it\u0027s okay. I don\u0027t need to quit my classes. I\u0027ve already talked to Giovanni, and I\u0027m doing a shoot during break, which is coming up soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited while the information was relayed to her uncle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s wonderful,\" her aunt said with a huge sigh of relief. \"I\u0027m sure the lawyer will wait, knowing the check will be coming. Your uncle will talk to him.\"\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn their minds the problem had been solved, and Will would once again get a free pass. They really believed, with the right lawyer and enough money, they could get their son out of anything. And thus far they\u0027d been right. They had somehow convinced themselves that Will was a victim. All he needed was enough love and support, and everything would be fine. Allison tried to care about her cousin, but she couldn\u0027t understand his parents\u0027 irrational devotion. They had added so many colors to the truth they had actually painted a new reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison\u0027s statement about talking to Giovanni wasn\u0027t a total lie. She had spoken with him just last week, but she didn\u0027t have any work scheduled. She could call him tomorrow and grovel, she supposed, unless he really did have something for her. He had become not only her employer, but also what she imagined a father should be. She had gained his complete loyalty when she agreed to work exclusively for him. He called her his muse and often asserted that she was giving up the chance to be a top model by staying in Boston instead of moving to New York. She disagreed. She was neither tall enough nor thin enough, and she was already too old by the fashion world\u0027s standards. There was also the fact that she didn\u0027t have the extra drive it would take to succeed. Besides, her ambitions were taking her in an entirely different direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison ended the call and, putting her relatives\u0027 problems aside, hurried up the steps. Heavy snow had started to fall, and the chill in the air was biting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a seat on the aisle three rows from the stage. She unzipped her vest, removed her scarf, sat back, and then remembered to turn her phone to mute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan was standing near the podium talking with the moderator. It would be easy to be envious of her, Allison thought. Jordan seemed to have it all. Not only was she brilliant; she was also very beautiful, with long auburn hair, sparkling eyes, and an infectious laugh. The moderator looked enthralled. Jordan spotted Allison and waved to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a brief introduction, Jordan spoke for thirty minutes about her experience as a software developer and her current project creating programs to simplify computer learning. Allison hung on every word. Then came the questions. Some of the computer science majors were a bit condescending, no doubt trying to impress Jordan with their knowledge. Her answers were given so patiently and with such a sweet smile Allison wondered if any of the questioners realized they had just been taken down by an expert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the lecture was officially over, most of the audience began to file out, but a few diehards stayed behind to continue the discussion. After twenty minutes of back-and-forth, a couple of students asked more complex questions that piqued Allison\u0027s interest. She listened intently to Jordan\u0027s expert answers and was spurred by her own curiosity to raise her hand. Jordan turned and pointed in her direction. \"Yes? Your question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison straightened in her chair and raised her voice. \"I was wondering if you ever considered using Cobar to write your code for that particular program.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll eyes were on her now. A few people exchanged puzzled glances. Cobar was an obscure programming language unknown to most of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan stopped to think for a minute. \"That\u0027s a really interesting idea,\" she answered. \"Why would you think it would fit this application?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison explained her reasoning, and before long the two women were engaged in a lively dialogue. At first, the other audience members who had remained behind tried to keep up with the conversation by asking for clarification, but it soon became apparent that most of them were lost. As the questions became more detailed-with Jordan asking Allison most of them-the dwindling audience began to lose interest, and one by one they exited the auditorium, leaving just Jordan, Allison, and a small band of fewer than a dozen students. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-9.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
