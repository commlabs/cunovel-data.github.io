{"id":79609,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER FOUR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE CREATORof the Little People was dressed in his customary yellow suit and green Wellington boots. He eyed us though thick glasses and twirled a heart-shaped watch between the fingers of his left hand. He was small and pudgy, with pure white hair and a cruel, mocking smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello boys,\" he greeted Harkat and me. \"Andhello ! beautiful ladies.\" He winked rakishly at Debbie and Alice. Debbie smiled, but the ex-Chief Inspector was wary. Mr Tiny took a seat and removed a boot to empty dirt out of it. I saw the strange, six webbed toes I\u0027d glimpsed once before. \"I see you survived your run-in with Master Leonard,\" he drawled, putting the boot back on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No thanks to you,\" I sniffed angrily. \"You knew Steve was the Lord of the Vampaneze. You could have told us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And spoilt the surprise?\" Mr Tiny laughed. \"I wouldn\u0027t have missed that fatal confrontation in the Cavern of Retribution for anything. I haven\u0027t enjoyed myself so much in years. The tension was unbearable, even though I guessed the outcome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You weren\u0027t in the cavern,\" I challenged him. \"And you didn\u0027tguess the outcome - youknew how it would end!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Tiny yawned insolently. \"I might not have been there physically,\" he said, \"but I was there in spirit. As for knowing the final outcome - I didn\u0027t. I suspected Larten would fail, but I wasn\u0027t sure. Hecould have won.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyhow,\" he said, clapping sharply. \"That\u0027s in the past. We\u0027ve other fish to fry.\" Looking at Harkat, he spun his watch so that it caught the light shining in the window of the van and reflected it into Harkat\u0027s round green eyes. \"Been sleeping well, Master Mulds?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarkat stared straight back at his master and said blankly, \"You know only too damn - well that I haven\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Tiny tucked his watch away without taking his eyes off Harkat. \"Time to find out who you used to be,\" he murmured. Harkat stiffened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why now?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His nightmares have intensified. He must come with me and search for his true identity, or stay, go mad - and perish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why can\u0027t you just tell him?\" I prodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t work that way,\" Mr Tiny said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will I be gone long?\" Harkat asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yes,\" came the answer. \"For ever, if things don\u0027t go well. It\u0027s not a case of simply finding out who you were and returning. The road is long and dangerous, and even if you struggle along to the end, there\u0027s no guarantee you\u0027ll make it back. But it\u0027s a road you must tread - unless you\u0027d rather go loopy and die.\" Mr Tiny let out a fake sigh. \"Poor Harkat - trapped between the devil and the deep blue sea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re all heart,\" Harkat grumbled, then faced me with a look of disgust. \"Looks like this is where - we part company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could come with you?\" I began, but he cut me short with a wave of a rough grey hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget it,\" he said. \"You have to lead Debbie and - Alice to Vampire Mountain. Not just to guide them, but to - protect them - it\u0027s a hard trek.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could wait until you returned,\" Debbie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Harkat sighed. \"There\u0027s no telling how long - I\u0027ll be gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gazed helplessly at Harkat. He was my best friend, and I hated the thought of leaving him. But I loved Debbie and didn\u0027t want to abandon her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually,\" Mr Tiny purred, stroking the top of his heart-shaped watch, \"I think young Shanshould accompany you - assuming you value your life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" Harkat barked sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Tiny studied his fingernails and spoke with a deceptively light tone. \"If Darren accompanies you, your chances of survival are fair. Alone, it\u0027s practically certain you\u0027ll fail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes narrowed hatefully. Mr Tiny had set Mr Crepsley and me on the trail of the Vampaneze Lord, knowing it was a journey bound to end in death. Now he wished to launch me on another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darren\u0027s not coming,\" Harkat said as I opened my mouth to lay into Mr Tiny. \"He has problems of his own - with the vampaneze. This is my quest, not his.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, dear boy,\" Mr Tiny simpered. \"I fully understand, and if he chooses to go with the beautiful ladies, I won\u0027t say anything to stop him. But it would be terribly wrong of me not to let him know in advance the awful?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop!\" Harkat snapped. \"Darren goes with Debbie and - Alice. End of story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harkat,\" I muttered uncertainly, \"maybe we should?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he stopped me. \"Your loyalty lies with the vampires. It\u0027s time you returned to the fold. I\u0027ll be OK on my own.\" And he turned away and wouldn\u0027t say anything more about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe broke camp before midday. Debbie and Alice had come well equipped, with ropes, thick jumpers, climbing boots, strong torches, lighters and matches, guns, knives, you name it! As a half-vampire, I didn\u0027t require any special tools. All I packed in my rucksack was a good strong knife and a change of clothes. I was wearing jeans, a shirt and a light jumper. Although Truska had gone to a lot of trouble restoring my pirate costume, I didn\u0027t feel comfortable in it - it was a child\u0027s outfit. I\u0027d picked up more normal gear over the lastfew months. Truska didn\u0027t mind - she said she\u0027d give the costume to Shancus or Urcha when they were older.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t wear my shoes. The trek to Vampire Mountain was a solemn tradition among vampires. No shoes or climbing gear were allowed. Normally you weren\u0027t allowed to flit either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn recent years, because of the War of the Scars, that rule had been relaxed. But the others still stood. Debbie and Alice thought I was crazy! It\u0027s hard for humans to understand the world of the creatures of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne other thing I did take was my diary. I\u0027d thought the diary lost for ever - it had been left behind in the city, along with the rest of my personal belongings - and was astonished when Alice produced it with a flourish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027d you get it?\" I gasped, fingering the soft, crinkled cover of one of the several notepads that made up the diary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was part of the evidence my officers collected after you were arrested. I sneaked it out before I quit the force.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you read it?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but others did.\" She smiled. \"They dismissed it as the fictional work of a lunatic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked for Harkat before we left, but he was locked away in Mr Tall\u0027s van with Mr Tiny. Mr Tall came to the door when I knocked and said the Little Person was not receiving visitors. I called out \"Goodbye\" but there was no reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt lousy as we cleared the camp, having said farewell to Evra, Merla and my other friends. But Harkat had been firm about his wishes, and I knew it made more sense to go to Vampire Mountain and take my rightful place in the Hall of Princes again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDebbie was delighted to have me back, and held on tight to my hand, telling me how excited she was - and a bit scared - to be heading for Vampire Mountain. She pumped me for information - what did vampires wear, did they sleep in coffins, could they turn into bats - but I was too distracted to answer in any great detail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027d walked two or three kilometres when I drew to a sudden halt. I was thinking about the times Harkat had saved my life - when he\u0027d rescued me from the jaws of a savage bear, when he\u0027d jumped into a pit during my Trials of Initiation and killed a wild boar as it was about to gouge me to death, the way he\u0027d fought beside me, swinging his axe with speed and skill, when we\u0027d taken on the vampaneze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darren?\" Debbie asked, gazing into my eyes, worried. \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s got to go back,\" Alice answered for me. I stared at her and she smiled. \"You can\u0027t ignore the obligations of friendship. Harkat needs you more than we do. Go help him, and catch us up later if you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he told me to leave,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t matter,\" Alice insisted. \"Your place is with him, not us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Debbie objected. \"We can\u0027t find our way to the Mountain alone!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice pulled a map out of her rucksack. \"I\u0027m sure Darren can point us in the right direction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Debbie cried again, clutching me tight. \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ll never see you again if you leave!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must,\" I sighed. \"Alice is right - I have to help Harkat. I\u0027d rather stay with you, but I\u0027d feel like a traitor if I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were hard tears in Debbie\u0027s eyes, but she blinked them back and nodded tensely. \"OK. If that\u0027s the way you want it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the way it has to be,\" I said. \"You\u0027d do the same thing in my place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Possibly.\" She smiled weakly, then, hiding her feelings behind a businesslike facade, she grabbed the map off Alice, laid it on the ground and told me to ink in the route to Vampire Mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly outlined the easiest route, pointed out a couple of alternate paths in case the first was blocked, and told them how to find their way through the maze of tunnels which led up the inside of the Mountain to the Halls where the vampires lived. Then, without any long goodbyes, I kissed Debbie quickly and thrust the rucksack with my newly recovered diary into Alice\u0027s hands. I asked her to look after it for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wished both women well, then turned and raced back for camp. I tried not to dwell on all that could happen to them on their way to the Mountain, and offered up a quick prayer to the gods of the vampires as I ran, asking them to watch over the ex-Chief Inspector and the teacher I loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was on the edge of the camp when I spotted Mr Tiny and Harkat in an open field. In front of the pair stood a shimmering arched doorway, unconnected to anything else. The edges of the doorway glowed red. Mr Tiny also glowed, his suit, hair and skin pulsing a dark, vibrant, crimson shade. The space within the edges of the doorway was a dull grey colour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Tiny heard me coming, looked over his shoulder and smiled like a shark. \"Ah - Master Shan! I thought you might turn up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darren!\" Harkat snapped furiously. \"I told you not to come! I won\u0027t take you with - me. You\u0027ll have to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Tiny laid a hand on the Little Person\u0027s back and shoved him through the doorway. There was a grey flash, then Harkat disappeared. I could see the field through the grey veil of the doorway - but no sign of Harkat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s he gone?\" I shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To search for the truth.\" Mr Tiny smiled, edged aside and gestured towards the glowing doorway. \"Care to search with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped up to the doorway, gazing uneasily at the glowing red edges and the grey sheen between. \"Where does this lead?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another place,\" Mr Tiny answered obscurely, then laid a hand on my right shoulder and looked at me intently. \"If you follow Harkat, you might never return. Think seriously about this. If you go with Harkat and die, you won\u0027t be here to face Steve Leonard when the time comes, and your absence might have terrible repercussions for vampires everywhere. Is your short, grey-skinned friend worth such an enormous risk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t have to think twice about that. \"Yes,\" I answered simply, and stepped through into unnatural, otherworldly greyness. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lake-of-souls-the-saga-of-darren-shan-10/page-5.html","bookId":2446,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:19:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:19:33 PM"}
