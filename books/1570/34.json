The shovel was large and heavy but he handled it as if it were made out of paper. I wondered how strong he was and how strong I would one day be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI considered telling him about Steve but was afraid he\u0027d go after him. Steve had suffered enough. Besides, his threat was an idle one. He\u0027d forget about me and Mr. Crepsley in a few weeks, when something new grabbed his attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hoped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Crepsley looked up and frowned. \"Are you sure you are all right?\" he asked. \"You seem very uptight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So would you if you\u0027d spent the day in a coffin,\" I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed out loud. \"Master Shan, I have spent more time in coffins than many of the truly dead!\" He gave the grave one last hard whack, then broke the shovel into little pieces and tossed them away. \"Is the stiffness wearing off?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s better than it was,\" I said, twisting my arms and waist. \"I wouldn\u0027t like to fake my death too often, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he mused. \"Well, hopefully it will not be necessary again. It is a dangerous stunt. Many things can go wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him. \"You told me I\u0027d be safe,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I lied. The potion sometimes drives its patients too far toward death and they never recover. And I could not be sure they would not perform an autopsy on you. And...Do you want to hear all this?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said sickly. \"I don\u0027t.\" I took an angry swing at him. He ducked out of the way easily, laughing as he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You told me it was safe!\" I shouted. \"You lied!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had to,\" he said. \"There was no other way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if I\u0027d died?\" I snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"I would be down one assistant. No great loss. I am sure I could have found another.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You...you...Oh!\" I kicked the ground angrily. There were lots of things I could have called him but I didn\u0027t like using bad language in the presence of the dead. I\u0027d tell him what I thought about his trickery later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you ready to go?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me a minute,\" I said. I jumped up on one of the taller headstones and gazed around at the town. I couldn\u0027t see much from here but this would be my last glimpse of the place where I had been born and lived, so I took my time and treated every dark alley as a posh cul-de-sac, every crumbling house as a sheik\u0027s palace, every two-story building as a skyscraper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will grow used to leaving after a time,\" Mr. Crepsley said. He was standing on the stone behind me, perched on little more than thin air. His face was gloomy. \"Vampires are always saying good-bye. We never stop anywhere very long. We are forever picking up our roots and moving on to new pastures. It is our way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is the first time the hardest?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he said, nodding. \"But it never gets easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long before I get used to it?\" I wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe a few decades,\" he said. \"Maybe longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDecades. He said it as though he was talking of months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t we ever make friends?\" I asked. \"Can\u0027t we ever have homes or wives or families?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he sighed. \"Never.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it get lonely?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Terribly so,\" he admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded sadly. At least he was being truthful. As I\u0027ve said before, I\u0027d always rather the truth however unpleasant it might be than a lie. You know where you stand with the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" I said, hopping down. \"I\u0027m ready.\" I picked up my bag and dusted some graveyard dirt from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You may ride on my back if you wish,\" Mr. Crepsley offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you,\" I replied politely. \"Maybe later, but I\u0027d rather walk the stiffness out of my legs first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rubbed my belly and listened to it growl. \"I haven\u0027t eaten since Sunday,\" I told him. \"I\u0027m hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too,\" he said. Then he took my hand in his and grinned bloodthirstily. \"Let us go eat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath and tried not to think about what would be on the menu. I nodded nervously and squeezed his hand. We turned and faced away from the graves. Then, side by side, the vampire and his assistant, we began walking... into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTO BE CONTINUED in book 2. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cirque-du-freak-the-saga-of-darren-shan-1/page-34.html","bookId":1570,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:49:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:49:55 PM"}
