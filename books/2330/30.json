Well, fuck you, I thought, and walked down the street to where I could get a look at the back of the limo. ABD-1, the license plate read. I decided the limo belonged to Avery Blanchard Davis, and gave myself credit for having figured something out. It was about time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was 4:19 when I walked out of Gruliow\u0027s house and just past 4:30 when the front door opened again and Hard-Way Ray stepped out and looked first to his left and then to his right. He didn\u0027t see me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had walked to Seventh Avenue and picked up an iced coffee at a deli, then perched on the stoop of an apartment house across the street to drink it. Davis\u0027s chauffeur had finished his cigarette by then and disappeared behind the limo\u0027s tinted glass. No one passed, on foot or on wheels, except for one redheaded kid on a skateboard who zoomed around the corner from Bedford Street, raced on past me and around the bend, and disappeared forever. I finished my coffee and flipped the cup into an uncovered garbage can. Then the door opened across the street and Gruliow came out and looked for me and didn\u0027t see me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up, and the movement caught Gruliow\u0027s attention. He beckoned and I let a car pass, then walked on across the street. Meanwhile he\u0027d come down the steps to meet me on the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d like you to stay with it,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go back inside,\" he said, \"so I can tell you officially.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e21\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They each put up a thousand dollars,\" I told Elaine. \"The ones who\u0027d brought their checkbooks along wrote out checks, and the rest handed over markers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had to take their markers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ray Gruliow took their markers,\" I said. \"And their checks. He\u0027s the one they hired. They engaged him collectively as their legal counsel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are they going to do, sue the murderer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Gruliow hired me. He gave me a check drawn on his office account for nine thousand dollars, which represents the checks and markers he received from the others plus a thousand dollars of his own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re working for him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"I\u0027ve been hired by him,\" I said, \"to conduct an investigation in his client\u0027s interest, his client being the group as a whole. The point of this, according to him, is to get me under the umbrella of attorney-client privilege.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does that mean? You can refuse to answer questions in court?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think anybody\u0027s concerned about that. No, it means I\u0027m not bound to divulge the results of my investigation to the police, or to repeat anything said to me by my employer, Gruliow, or his clients.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does that really cover you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Gruliow seemed to think it does. In any case, if I should feel it was appropriate for me to withhold information from the police, I\u0027d do it irrespective of the legal ramifications. So it can\u0027t hurt to have whatever shield attorney-client privilege provides, but I\u0027m going to do the same thing with or without it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My hero,\" she said. \"He\u0027ll do anything for a client.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not exactly,\" I said, \"because I told them I reserved the option of bringing the cops in at any point. My main concern is stopping this guy before there are any more killings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s their concern, too, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d think so, wouldn\u0027t you? I don\u0027t know what was said while I was sitting on the stoop across the street, but my impression was that they\u0027re more interested in keeping the club of thirty-one off tabloid television than they are in keeping their own names out of the obituary column. If the story ever breaks, that\u0027s the end of the club. Don\u0027t forget, it was in existence before they were born, and they expect it to survive them all. They\u0027re not particularly eager to die for it, but they don\u0027t want to have to live without it, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guys,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, that\u0027s not the worst of it,\" I said. \"Two of them were wearing identical red-and-black striped ties, and nobody said a word about it. I don\u0027t even think they noticed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shocking,\" she said. \"Except I don\u0027t believe it. You\u0027re making it up, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, as a matter of fact. How\u0027d you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you wouldn\u0027t have noticed either, you bear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I might. I\u0027m a trained observer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Describe their ties.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whose ties?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everybody\u0027s ties.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Gerry Billings was wearing a bow tie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He always wears a bow tie. What color?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And don\u0027t make something up. Do you remember any of their ties?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some were striped,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. And some weren\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had more important things on my mind,\" I said, \"than ties.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" she said. \"I rest my case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I took Gruliow\u0027s check I talked to them about security. \"What you have to do,\" I said, \"is pay attention to things you\u0027re in the habit of overlooking, or taking for granted. Is someone following you on the street? Is the same car circling your block over and over, or staked out across the street from your house? Are you getting a rash of suspicious phone calls? Is there a lot of static on your telephone line, or a batch of clicks along with abrupt changes in volume?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Paranoia time,\" someone said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A certain degree of paranoia\u0027s part of life in our times,\" I said. \"You people have a right to be a little more paranoid than the norm. You\u0027ve just paid out a thousand dollars a man because someone\u0027s trying to kill you. You don\u0027t want to make it easy for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about hiring bodyguards?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My driver\u0027s armed,\" Avery Davis volunteered, \"and the car\u0027s bulletproof. That\u0027s not a response to this particular threat. A couple of friends of ours were carjacked- Ed and Rhea Feinbock?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I read about that,\" Bill Ludgate said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I heard about it firsthand, from Ed. The sons of bitches pistol-whipped him. And then I read about other instances, and I bought a limo and hired a pro to drive it. While I was at it, I picked a man with bodyguard experience.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will he leap into the line of fire?\" Bob Berk wanted to know. \"Will he take a bullet for you, Avery?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t think so, not for what I\u0027m paying him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"I don\u0027t want to talk anybody out of employing bodyguards, but I don\u0027t think the situation warrants it. I think it\u0027s more important for you to live defensively than that you hire someone to defend you. You\u0027re going to have to keep your guard up all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By checking to see if we\u0027re being followed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Among other things. Remember how Ian Heller died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jumped in front of a subway,\" someone said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jumped or fell,\" I said, \"and let\u0027s assume for the moment he was pushed. The cop on the case has spent enough time underground to be very cautious himself on subway platforms. He\u0027s wary of ambulatory psychotics, careful not to get between some potential maniac and the edge of the platform. But that kind of caution alone wouldn\u0027t have protected Ian Heller.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suppose it was someone Heller knew. Suppose it was a friend of his.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re saying it was one of us,\" Ken McGarry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not necessarily, although I can\u0027t rule it out. You didn\u0027t all automatically clear yourselves by writing out a thousand-dollar check. But let\u0027s say Heller was in the subway, waiting for a train, and someone approached him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone he knew?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone who knew him,\" I said. \"Someone who called him by name. \u0027You\u0027re Ian Heller, aren\u0027t you? You don\u0027t remember me, but we met at So-and-so\u0027s party.\u0027 He\u0027d know enough about Heller to find a pretext for conversation. Heller wouldn\u0027t worry about getting shoved in front of a train. If anything, he\u0027d feel more secure than he\u0027d felt a few minutes ago. He wasn\u0027t all alone with a group of potentially dangerous strangers. He had a friend with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGordon Walser said it was diabolical. Lowell Hunter said, \"You know, it reminds me of The Godfather. \u0027The attack when it comes will be from someone you trust, someone you would never doubt for a moment. That\u0027s who they\u0027ll use.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s how he must do it,\" I said. \"In a way, Ian Heller was a bad example. His death occurred during rush hour. The platform was crowded, and anybody could have positioned himself properly and given him a well-timed shove. But it could have happened at an off-hour in an empty station, just the way I described it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we\u0027ll stay away from subways,\" someone said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What you ought to do,\" I suggested, \"is think of the killer more as a confidence man than a wild-eyed assassin. Think of him stalking Alan Watson on his way home, then conveniently running into him after Watson stopped for pizza on Austin Street. \u0027Alan, how are you? You walking home? I\u0027m going the same way, I\u0027ll keep you company.\u0027 Even if Watson had never seen the guy before, he\u0027d have to assume he was a neighbor, someone he\u0027d met and forgotten. And they probably had a very pleasant conversation, right up to the time when the guy stuck a knife in Watson\u0027s chest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if I got through to them,\" I told Elaine. \"A couple of them wanted to know if they ought to arm themselves. I didn\u0027t know what to tell them. They probably couldn\u0027t get carry permits, certainly not in a hurry, so that would mean risking an illegal-weapons charge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s better than getting killed, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, and these men are respectable establishment types; if they wound up defending themselves with an illegal handgun, nobody\u0027d be in a rush to bring charges against them. But suppose some perfectly innocent person asked one of them for a match, or lost his balance and lurched into one of our armed heroes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bang bang.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told them to call me if anything out of the ordinary happens. They\u0027ll keep in touch with each other, too. It\u0027s funny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The way it\u0027s got them relating to one another. In one way they\u0027re closer. Remember, these are fellows who\u0027ve shared a very intimate association for over thirty years- but only one night a year. They\u0027re united by deep and longstanding bonds of brotherhood, but they don\u0027t really know each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now things have changed, and nothing brings you together like the need to defend yourselves against a common enemy. But at the same time, the enemy might be one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t Pogo have something to say about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027We have met the enemy and he is us.\u0027 The thing is we haven\u0027t met the enemy, not head-on. He may be one of us and he may not. So-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So they\u0027re closely bonded but a little uneasy about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that. For the first time ever they have to maintain contact with one another. And, also for the first time, they don\u0027t dare trust each other. It\u0027s like Cannibals and Christians.\" She looked bewildered. \"You know, Cannibals and Christians. It\u0027s a logic problem, you\u0027ve got six people trying to cross a river, three cannibals and three Christians, and the boat only holds three people and you can\u0027t have one Christian left alone with two cannibals or he\u0027ll get eaten.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-long-line-of-dead-men-matthew-scudder-12/page-30.html","bookId":2330,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:53:24 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:53:24 AM"}
