These men were going into Bithynia just to do Christ\u0027s work, and the door is shut against them by Christ\u0027s own Spirit. I, too, have experienced this in certain moments. I have sometimes found myself interrupted in what seemed to me a career of usefulness. Opposition came and forced me to go back, or sickness came and compelled me to retire into a desert apart. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard at such times to leave my work undone when I believed that work to be the service of the Spirit. But I came to remember that the Spirit has not only a service of work, but a service of waiting. I came to see that in the Kingdom of Christ there are not only times for action, but times in which to forbear acting. I came to learn that the desert place apart is often the most useful spot in the varied life of man--more rich in harvest than the seasons in which the corn and wine abounded. I have been taught to thank the blessed Spirit that many a darling Bithynia had to be left unvisited by me. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd so, Thou Divine Spirit, would I still be led by Thee. Still there come to me disappointed prospects of usefulness. Today the door seems to open into life and work for Thee; tomorrow it closes before me just as I am about to enter. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eTeach me to see another door in the very inaction of the hour. Help me to find in the very prohibition thus to serve Thee, a new opening into Thy service. Inspire me with the knowledge that a man may at times be called to do his duty by doing nothing, to work by keeping still, to serve by waiting. When I remember the power of the \"still small voice,\" I shall not murmur that sometimes the Spirit suffers me not to go. --George Matheson \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“ When I cannot understand my father’s leading, And it seems to be but hard and cruel fate, Still I hear that gentle whisper ever pleading, God is working, God is faithful, ONLY WAIT. \" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e九月二十四日 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e「到了每西亚的边界，他们想要往庇推尼去，耶稣的灵却不许。」（徒十六7）\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e这是一个多么奇怪的禁止！这些人想要往庇推尼去，目的是为作主的工，但是主自几反把工作的门关了起来。我自己也曾有这样的经历。有时候，我自以为成功的路径，反受到了许多拦阻。反对起来摧逼我回去，疾病进来强迫我退到荒野去。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e有时工作尚未做完圣灵要我把它放下，这实在是非常困难的事。但是神给我看见：工作是事奉神，等候也是事奉神。要我活动的是神，禁止我活动的是神。感谢神，我现在知道多少时候荒野原是最有益的地方。我感谢神，许多我所爱去的庇推尼，我都没有去。\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e圣灵阿，虽然我的前途常遭挫折，我仍然愿意拣选祢的引导。今天工作的门似乎开了，明天当我正要进去的时候又忽然关了，这都是祢的事情。 \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e求祢教导我在等候中看见前面的路径。求祢教导我在禁止中寻见事奉祢的新路。求祢教导我在不作工的时候尽忠━用安静来作工，用等候来事奉。－－马德胜\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/92/5415.html","bookId":475,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 6:49:03 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 6:49:03 AM"}
