This would be perhaps his hundredth dawn, and he knew well the sting the searing light would bring to his lavender eyes - eyes that had known only the darkness of the Underdark for more than four decades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drow did not turn away, though, when the upper rim of the flaming sun crested the horizon. He accepted the light as his purgatory, a pain necessary if he was to follow his chosen path, to become a creature of the surface world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray smoke wafted up before the drow\u0027s dark-skinned face. He knew what it meant without even looking down. His piwafwi, the magical drow-made cloak that had so many times in the Underdark shielded him from probing enemy eyes, had finally succumbed to the daylight. The magic in the cloak had begun fading weeks before, and the fabric itself was simply melting away. Wide holes appeared as patches of the garment dissolved, and the drow pulled his arms in tightly to salvage as much as he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wouldn\u0027t make any difference, he knew; the cloak was doomed to waste away in this world so different from where it had been created. The drow clung to it desperately, somehow viewing it as an analogy to his own fate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun climbed higher and tears rolled out of the drow\u0027s squinting lavender eyes. He could not see the smoke anymore, could see nothing beyond the blinding glare of that terrible ball of fire. Still he sat and watched, right through the dawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo survive, he had to adapt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed his toe painfully down against a jag in the stone and focused his attention away from his eyes, from the dizziness that threatened to overcome him. He thought of how thin his finely woven boots had become and knew that they, too, would soon dissipate into nothingness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen his scimitars, perhaps? Would those magnificent drow weapons, which had sustained him through so many trials, be no more? What fate awaited Guenhwyvar, his magical panther companion? Unconsciously the drow dropped a hand into his pouch to feel the marvelous figurine, so perfect in every detail, which he used to summon the cat. Its solidity reassured him in that moment of doubt, but if it, too, had been crafted by the dark elves, imbued with the magic so particular to their domain, would Guenhwyvar soon be lost?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a pitiful creature I will become,\" the drow lamented in his native tongue. He wondered, not for the first time and certainly not for the last, about the wisdom of his decision to leave the Underdark, to forsake the world of his evil people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head pounded; sweat rolled into his eyes, heightening the sting. The sun continued its ascent and the drow could not endure. He rose and turned toward the small cave he had taken as his home, and he again put a hand absently on the panther figurine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis piwafwi hung in tatters about him, serving as meager protection from the mountain winds\u0027 chill bite. There was no wind in the Underdark except for slight currents rising off pools of magma, and no chill except for the icy touch of an undead monster. This surface world, which the drow had known for several months, showed him many differences, many variables - too many, he often believed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt Do\u0027Urden would not surrender. The Underdark was the world of his kin, of his family, and in that darkness he would find no rest. Following the demands of his principles, he had struck out against Lloth, the Spider Queen, the evil deity his people revered above life itself. The dark elves, Drizzt\u0027s family, would not forgive his blasphemy, and the Underdark had no holes deep enough to escape their long reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if Drizzt believed that the sun would burn him away, as it burned away his boots and his precious piwafwi, even if he became no more than insubstantial, gray smoke blowing away in the chill mountain breeze, he would retain his principles and dignity, those elements that made his life worthwhile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrizzt pulled off his cloak\u0027s remains and tossed them down a deep chasm. The chilly wind nipped against his sweat-beaded brow, but the drow walked straight and proud, his jaw firm and his lavender eyes wide open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the fate he preferred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong the side of a different mountain, not so far away, another creature watched the rising sun. Ulgulu, too, had left his birthplace, the filthy, smoking rifts that marked the plane of Gehenna, but this monster had not come of his own accord. It was Ulgulu\u0027s fate, his penance, to grow in this world until he attained sufficient strength to return to his home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUlgulu\u0027s lot was murder, feeding on the life force of the weak mortals around him. He was close now to attaining his maturity: huge and strong and terrible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery kill made him stronger. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-elf-trilogy-sojourn-the-dark-elf-trilogy-3/page-1.html","bookId":2106,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:50:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:50:15 PM"}
