{"id":24379,"no":19,"title":"XVII. THE WAY OF THE CREATING ONE.","content":"Wouldst thou go into isolation, my brother? Wouldst thou seek the way unto thyself? Tarry yet a little and hearken unto me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He who seeketh may easily get lost himself. All isolation is wrong”: so say the herd. And long didst thou belong to the herd.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The voice of the herd will still echo in thee. And when thou sayest, “I have no longer a conscience in common with you,” then will it be a plaint and a pain.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lo, that pain itself did the same conscience produce; and the last gleam of that conscience still gloweth on thine affliction.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But thou wouldst go the way of thine affliction, which is the way unto thyself? Then show me thine authority and thy strength to do so!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Art thou a new strength and a new authority? A first motion? A self-rolling wheel? Canst thou also compel stars to revolve around thee?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Alas! there is so much lusting for loftiness! There are so many convulsions of the ambitions! Show me that thou art not a lusting and ambitious one!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Alas! there are so many great thoughts that do nothing more than the bellows: they inflate, and make emptier than ever.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Free, dost thou call thyself? Thy ruling thought would I hear of, and not that thou hast escaped from a yoke.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Art thou one ENTITLED to escape from a yoke? Many a one hath cast away his final worth when he hath cast away his servitude.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Free from what? What doth that matter to Zarathustra! Clearly, however, shall thine eye show unto me: free FOR WHAT?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Canst thou give unto thyself thy bad and thy good, and set up thy will as a law over thee? Canst thou be judge for thyself, and avenger of thy law?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Terrible is aloneness with the judge and avenger of one’s own law. Thus is a star projected into desert space, and into the icy breath of aloneness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To-day sufferest thou still from the multitude, thou individual; to-day hast thou still thy courage unabated, and thy hopes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But one day will the solitude weary thee; one day will thy pride yield, and thy courage quail. Thou wilt one day cry: “I am alone!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One day wilt thou see no longer thy loftiness, and see too closely thy lowliness; thy sublimity itself will frighten thee as a phantom. Thou wilt one day cry: “All is false!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There are feelings which seek to slay the lonesome one; if they do not succeed, then must they themselves die! But art thou capable of it—to be a murderer?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hast thou ever known, my brother, the word “disdain”? And the anguish of thy justice in being just to those that disdain thee?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thou forcest many to think differently about thee; that, charge they heavily to thine account. Thou camest nigh unto them, and yet wentest past: for that they never forgive thee.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thou goest beyond them: but the higher thou risest, the smaller doth the eye of envy see thee. Most of all, however, is the flying one hated.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “How could ye be just unto me!”—must thou say—“I choose your injustice as my allotted portion.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Injustice and filth cast they at the lonesome one: but, my brother, if thou wouldst be a star, thou must shine for them none the less on that account!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And be on thy guard against the good and just! They would fain crucify those who devise their own virtue—they hate the lonesome ones.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Be on thy guard, also, against holy simplicity! All is unholy to it that is not simple; fain, likewise, would it play with the fire—of the fagot and stake.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And be on thy guard, also, against the assaults of thy love! Too readily doth the recluse reach his hand to any one who meeteth him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To many a one mayest thou not give thy hand, but only thy paw; and I wish thy paw also to have claws.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the worst enemy thou canst meet, wilt thou thyself always be; thou waylayest thyself in caverns and forests.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thou lonesome one, thou goest the way to thyself! And past thyself and thy seven devils leadeth thy way!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A heretic wilt thou be to thyself, and a wizard and a sooth-sayer, and a fool, and a doubter, and a reprobate, and a villain.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ready must thou be to burn thyself in thine own flame; how couldst thou become new if thou have not first become ashes!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thou lonesome one, thou goest the way of the creating one: a God wilt thou create for thyself out of thy seven devils!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thou lonesome one, thou goest the way of the loving one: thou lovest thyself, and on that account despisest thou thyself, as only the loving ones despise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To create, desireth the loving one, because he despiseth! What knoweth he of love who hath not been obliged to despise just what he loved!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With thy love, go into thine isolation, my brother, and with thy creating; and late only will justice limp after thee.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With my tears, go into thine isolation, my brother. I love him who seeketh to create beyond himself, and thus succumbeth.—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thus spake Zarathustra.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2158/61031.html","bookId":445,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 2:08:22 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 2:08:22 PM"}
