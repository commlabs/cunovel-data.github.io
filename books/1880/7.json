I\u0027m never sitting on their couch again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know what to tell him. I have no advice about this situation. \"It sounds like you better get crackin\u0027. You have, what…seven months before it gets here? I\u0027d stock up for the winter while I could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s another thing,\" he grumbles. \"Emma always has preterm labor and gets put on pelvic rest, so it\u0027s going to thwart me months before it even gets here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn. My little brother has me feeling sorry for him. \"Does Mum know yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. We told her last night. She\u0027s thrilled beyond words. She wasn\u0027t expecting to get another grandchild until you found Laurelyn and knocked her up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil I knock Laurelyn up. There was a time when hearing something like that would\u0027ve caused me to lose it, but not today. I\u0027m no longer afraid of what life would be like with a family. I\u0027m way more afraid of what it would be like without one—but particularly without Laurelyn. I know she wants babies and I plan on giving them to her—as many as she wants, any time she\u0027s ready. I very much look forward to putting them inside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll be okay. I\u0027m sure you and Emma will make it work just fine with another kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know it\u0027ll be okay. I\u0027m just panicking because this one wasn\u0027t planned. I feel like I\u0027ve lost control and I don\u0027t like it. God, you must think I\u0027m a total dickhead for calling my own kid a cockblocker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you I wouldn\u0027t judge—and I won\u0027t—because I don\u0027t know how I\u0027d feel if it were me in your shoes. And we both know you\u0027ll love the little cockblocker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish I were freaking out about Laurelyn being pregnant. At least that would mean I had her with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jack, you\u0027re going to find Laurelyn and then it\u0027ll be you in these anxiety shoes because you don\u0027t want to give up that special time with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope I get the chance to panic over it. I really do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI park the Sunset in the garage and find Mrs. Porcelli in the kitchen. \"Mr. McLachlan, it\u0027s good to see you back. I trust your visit with your family went well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish I\u0027d gone to Sydney for a casual visit, but that\u0027s not what sent me there. I went for entirely different reasons I didn\u0027t wish to discuss, so I lie. \"Yes, everyone is well and I had a nice visit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that\u0027s good. I can get you some lunch if you\u0027re hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, but that won\u0027t be necessary. I stopped at a little café a couple of hours ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I\u0027m walking out, Mrs. Porcelli calls my name. \"Mr. McLachlan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn and see a look of uncertainty in my housekeeper\u0027s eyes—as if she\u0027s searching for the right words to say to me. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s wringing her hands like she\u0027s nervous. My curiosity is piqued. \"I didn\u0027t know if I should say anything, but I decided I thought you had the right to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wait for her further explanation but she doesn\u0027t give me one. Whatever this is about, she isn\u0027t wanting to tell me. \"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was cleaning your bedroom and found something of Laurelyn\u0027s under the bed. I placed them on your nightstand because I didn\u0027t know what to do with them. Throwing them in the trash didn\u0027t feel right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh! A pair of Laurelyn\u0027s undies must\u0027ve fallen under the bed during one of our naughties. I\u0027m sure that\u0027s what has this little gray-haired lady blushing crimson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for letting me know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile as I walk the hall toward my bedroom. Those will be a nice little memento to have. Hmm…I wonder which pair it\u0027ll be? I find myself hoping that it\u0027s the white lace ones. I took those off her the day we made love the first time—instead of fucking—the day she told me she loved me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can see from the doorway that it\u0027s not the white lace ones; these are colorful. And folded into a tiny rectangle. I can\u0027t recall her ever wearing knickers like those, so I cross the room for a better inspection. It isn\u0027t undies at all. It\u0027s the decorative cloth pouch that houses Laurelyn\u0027s birth control pills. I slide the foil package out and confirm what I suspect. This is the pack she would\u0027ve been taking when she left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit on the bed, holding it in my hand. Does this mean she\u0027s going to be pregnant? It only took Em missing two days—not half a pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI go to the living room and grab my laptop before I dash back to the bedroom. I don\u0027t even know what to search. My fingers are trembling as I type what happens if you stop birth control midpack and hit enter. I choose the first result since it looks like a medical site. I scan the article reading a lot of things I don\u0027t understand, but then I come upon a heading called \"Increased Chance of Pregnancy.\" That I can understand, so I read because I\u0027m anxious to see what it says: There is a sudden increase in the risk of pregnancy when you stop the pill midmonth. The hormone levels change quickly by stopping the pill in the middle of the cycle, and this can increase your chances of conceiving. There may be some women who think they are protected for the whole month even if they stop early, but this is not true. You are only covered and protected while taking the pill on a regular, everyday basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuck! Does Laurelyn know this? Does she understand what missing these pills could mean? I have no way of knowing, and I can\u0027t ask her because she\u0027s not here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJim\u0027s been in the States looking for her for five days. He\u0027s phoned daily with updates but that\u0027s not enough now that I know she could be pregnant. I\u0027m dying here; I need him to find her already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take my phone from my pocket and dial. \"Mr. McLachlan…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t have the patience to hear anything except that he knows where she is. \"Did you find her yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI already know he hasn\u0027t. He would\u0027ve notified me immediately if he had; he has strict instructions to call the moment he has her whereabouts. \"No, I\u0027m sorry, Mr. McLachlan. There is no housing in Nashville registered under Addison Donavon, and the one I found this morning wasn\u0027t Laurelyn\u0027s friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re certain? She could be lying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The girl was still in high school and her mother wasn\u0027t happy about me being at their house asking about her daughter. There\u0027s been no new activity on any of Addison\u0027s social networking since she posted the day she left Australia. It\u0027s like she\u0027s dropped off the face of the earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne roadblock after another. We found out a few days ago that Laurelyn had dropped her service with her cellular provider, so our best lead was no lead at all. We don\u0027t know why she did it, but I have a sneaking suspicion that Blake Phillips is the reason behind it. I keep imagining him chasing after Laurelyn now that she\u0027s returned to Nashville, and the thought makes me crazy. I\u0027m back to that place where I want to choke the life out of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, what\u0027s your plan, Jim?\" I really need him to tell me he has a new strategy since finding Addison has proven fruitless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand you wanted him to be a last resort, but I recommend going to see Blake Phillips. It seems like a waste to run all over California looking for Addison when I have him so close.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m going to be sick if she\u0027s with him. Maybe I wanted him to be a last resort because I\u0027m paralyzed with fear every time I think about her being with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to see his reaction when Jim questions him about her. I need to read his face and response. \"I want you to video your meeting and send it to me immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJim doesn\u0027t hesitate. \"Absolutely, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow. I\u0027m driving home in a daze because I have a dad and he wants to ruin the man who threatened me. He said Blake Phillips wouldn\u0027t be able to find a job bagging groceries in this town when he\u0027s finished with him. The thought makes me happy, until I remember that he has three little kids depending on him. As much as I\u0027d like to see Blake crawl on his belly like the snake that he is, I can\u0027t live with the guilt of being the reason behind any misfortune for those children. It\u0027s not their fault their dad is a total skeezer. Which is why I asked Jake to do nothing where Blake is concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI park in my usual spot outside the apartment and sit staring at the door. I don\u0027t want to go inside. Being alone for the past couple of weeks hasn\u0027t been good for me. It\u0027s given me too much time to think about how much I miss Jack Henry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m startled out of my trance when I hear Addison\u0027s ringtone. \"Waddup,\" I cheerfully answer. I hope she can\u0027t tell how phony I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, girl. What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAddison\u0027s called to check on me every day—sometimes twice. She\u0027s been very attentive for…well, for Addison. I\u0027ve never seen her so concerned. I think her feelings for Zac have given her empathy—something I\u0027m not certain she was capable of in the past. \"Umm, I just got home from my mom\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d that go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t had enough time to process Jake Beckett, so it wasn\u0027t something I was ready to discuss, especially over the phone. And Addison is going to have a come-apart when she finds out. \"It was fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about your meeting with your record pro-doucher?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t help but laugh every time I hear Addie call Blake a pro-doucher. The name is so fitting. \"It went great. He was very cooperative—until he followed me out to my car and basically held me down while he threatened to ruin my career if I didn\u0027t come back to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear Addison huff. \"Did that fucker hurt you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nah! You know I\u0027m a tough bird. He scared me a little, but it\u0027s more likely that I\u0027m the one who hurt him. I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll be needing a vasectomy any time soon. I can say with a fair amount of certainty that my knee probably busted his balls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAddison cackles. \"I\u0027m really glad to hear you racked \u0027em good for him, but what does that mean for your career?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh deeply before I admit where I stand, as if it\u0027ll make it sound better. \"It means I\u0027ve lost it all—everything I\u0027ve worked so hard for—and I\u0027ll have to start over. All because I refused to have an affair with a married man.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beauty-from-surrender-beauty-2/page-7.html","bookId":1880,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:40 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:40 PM"}
