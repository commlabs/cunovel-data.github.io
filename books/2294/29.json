So why not leave? What keeps you here?” My roommate Mei-Ling was a diminutive ninth grader and she’d managed to escape. “Your blood kin aren’t even on the island with you. I don’t get it. Why do you even stay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A man must do as a man must do,” he said mysteriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That didn’t stop Carden.” I’d said it dismissively, intending the words only as a sting to myself, but I saw instantly how they stung Ronan instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are in over your head with that…him. I’d think that you, Annelise, more than anyone would strive for better than what he offers you. I tell you, a man does as he must, but Carden McCloud is no man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis anger, so quick and sharp, startled me. “And you are?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached out, resting his hand in the dirt at my hip, leaning closer. “I am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy breath hitched. I stilled, waiting to see what would happen next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his other hand, slid it around my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was happening? Was this a lesson? Had I offended him—did he think I was accusing him of being afraid to touch a girl, and now he had something to prove?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand was warm and gentle gliding over my skin, and my scalp tingled as his fingers laced through the hair at the back of my neck. He leaned closer still, until I could no longer see his features clearly. Only impressions of Ronan filled my view. The dark stubble. His full mouth. A fringe of black lashes on lids half-closed. Those features had once rocked my world. Once, in a Florida parking lot, they’d been enough to convince me to get into a car with a stranger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now? Now Ronan was no longer a stranger. He’d become so familiar to me. Somehow, Ronan had become all I had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow I missed Carden and the comfort he’d given me. I longed for connection. I missed my friends. All of them, they’d been so dear to me, and yet here I was, alone, aching, steeped in desolation and uncertainty. Carden had vanished. My friends were lost to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone was gone, but Ronan was here. Right here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWould it be so bad, so wrong, to seek just a little bit of comfort with him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned in to him, testing. He didn’t move. Was this solace that he was offering? Was it more? I leaned closer, and he still didn’t move away. My heart began to pound. All my fear and desolation and abandonment…it all catalyzed, becoming this need I felt now. Ronan was going to kiss me, and even if he was using his hypnotic touch, I’d take it. I’d take him. I just wanted to feel him, because somehow I knew. He wasn’t using his powers. This was just a touch—the touch of a guy on my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen suddenly…cold air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my eyes—when had I closed them?—and saw he was staring at me, his gaze so heavy and dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t,” he said. His jaw was tight, and it was like he had to grit out the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared after him, even though I couldn’t see anything in the darkness. Breathily, I asked the universe, “What the hell was that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI collapsed onto my back, grinding my fingers into my hair as I stared up at the sky. My heart was still skittering in my chest, my pulse as shallow as the air in my lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoly crap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I no longer reminded him of his sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI plopped onto the sand, panting for breath, clutching a hand at my side. I hoped the pain was just a stitch from my run and not the beginnings of the blood fever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, fine…so maybe it wasn’t as dire as all that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheck that—emotionally, it was pretty freaking dire, but physically? I was feeling some discomfort, but nothing crippling, not yet. Just…a needful sort of thirst. I thought back to last term. I couldn’t go through that ordeal again, through the pain of separation and the early stages of breaking a bond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarden. He was the opposite of stupid Ronan. I didn’t get stupid Ronan at all—lurking, popping up at unusual times, almost kissing me. When Carden had wanted to kiss me, he’d kissed me. He was so easy, so predictable…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil he was no longer easy and predictable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it me? Was I just lame with guys? My vampire had been gone for too long now. Either something had happened to him—which I honestly thought I’d have felt—or he’d simply…bailed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he couldn’t just dump me, right? Logically, I knew: We had a bond. So whether he really wanted to be with me or not, physically he had to come back at some point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was the crux of it. I wanted someone who wanted to be with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone who liked me. Maybe loved me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of the difference between my parents. When my mom had been alive, presumably she’d wanted to be with me because it gave her joy. My memories of her were vague, but they were happy—we’d both been happy—and it wasn’t such a leap to deduce that she’d wanted to spend time with me. As opposed to my father, who’d kept me around merely because he was obligated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas that what I’d become to Carden? An obligation? All those words he’d said. Dove shmove. All of it meaningless crap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stupid,” I muttered, stretching into the ache. My train of thought was stupid. This situation was stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt stupid. I’d been too smitten to sense what’d been going on in Carden’s head our last night together. While I was experiencing the most amazingly special night of my life, he’d already checked out. He fed me over and over that night because he’d known all along that he’d be leaving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure, eventually he’d come back. He’d saunter back one of these days, grinning all Carden-like, feeding me again, just enough to sustain our bond. And then he’d probably turn around and saunter right back out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll that intimacy I thought we’d shared for all those weeks…did none of it count? Had it been my imagination?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey, at least the guy had done me a solid and overfed me. Because of his foresight, I’d had minimal physical symptoms since he left. Though this pang in my side made me wonder just how long I had until the blood fever set in. One month? One year? A decade?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow long would he be gone anyway? I couldn’t last forever—minimal physical symptoms wasn’t the same as no physical symptoms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shaded my eyes, staring out to sea. We didn’t get much sunlight on this rock, but what we did get irritated vampire eyes, and I’d purposely taken my run smack-dab in the middle of a Saturday afternoon. Lately, 12:01 had become a favorite sight on my digital watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough why I’d chosen to run in the shadow of the damned Needle, the chimney rock formation that Carden could scale and leap from like he was some kind of superhero, was beyond my understanding. Or maybe it wasn’t—maybe this particular workout spot had been an entirely intentional choice. Because, let’s be honest: I wanted to think about Carden. Duh. I wanted him to appear, as he had so many times, coming from out of the blue to nestle next to me in the sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing with Ronan had upset me, and I just wanted everything back the way it’d been before. But if Ronan was going to be all weird and Carden all gone, then that left me with nobody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaves slapped and churned against the base of the Needle. Had I really thought Carden’s head might bob into view, that he might spring from the water, clambering up the side as I’d seen him do before? I decided I was like that rock—alone in the middle of a bleak sea, pummeled by waves…until stupid Carden had climbed me and then leapt free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jeez.” I had to laugh at myself—I really hated my own drama sometimes. “Pathetic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stretched on an exhale, grabbing my toes, pulling hard, folding myself over my aching belly. I inched my fingertips lower on the soles of my feet, wrenching my torso lower, daring my hamstrings to quiver and burn. Daring the pain to wipe out everything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll snap in half,” a male voice said from behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sprang up on a startled yelp. Josh. “I’ll snap you in half if you scare me like that again.” I glanced around, looking behind him, but he was alone. “Where’d you come from anyway?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cupped his hand over his eyes. “I had a Trainee thing. At the keep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure you did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was looking for you earlier,” he added. The sun wasn’t that bright, but he kept his hand shielded over his eyes, like he was in pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You all right?” I remembered the rogue vampire I’d fought—that Carden had fought for me—and the eerie pale eyes, hidden behind sunglasses, that’d betrayed his ancient years. The older the vamps got, the more sensitive to light they became. It made sense that Trainees would be no different. “Shouldn’t you wear, like, a hat or something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nah, I’m good.” He plopped next to me on the sand. “It’s just your radiant beauty, it blinds me, yeah?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and picked at my sweaty shirt. “The only thing I’m radiating is sweat.” I was lonely and uncertain, but Josh and his easy, Aussie good humor always made me smile. It didn’t hurt that he was pretty cute, too, in a scruffy sun-kissed beach-boy way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clutched a hand to his heart. “She denies my compliment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait…was this real flirting or playful friend flirting? If my tense interactions with Ronan were any indication, I had no clue how to tell the difference between the two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Easy, sailor.” I really looked then, reconsidering him. Not as a friend, or as someone I’d gotten to know, but as a guy. Honestly, by that point, I was just that angry at both Carden and Ronan. If they were going to blow me off, then I’d feel free to look at other guys, dammit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him, and though I saw the appeal, I didn’t feel the appeal. No butterflies or any of that other good stuff. Sorry, mate, I thought. Maybe in another life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, a boy can try,” he said, still doing the flirty thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And a girl could get the wrong idea.” Feeling a mite uncomfortable, I erected the barest of shields between us. Carden had warned me not to trust Josh—not to trust any of them. Though, clearly, I should’ve taken the advice and not trusted Carden. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-keep-the-watchers-4/page-29.html","bookId":2294,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:59 PM"}
