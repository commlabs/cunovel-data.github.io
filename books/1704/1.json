It felt grotesque and unnecessary, but she didn’t object. It was the procedure. She knew that. One of the other Vessels had described it to her at lunch a month before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mask?” she had asked in surprise, almost chuckling at the strange image. “What’s the mask for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, it’s not really a mask,” the young woman seated on her left corrected herself, and took another bite of the crisp salad. “It’s a blindfold, actually.” She was whispering. They were not supposed to discuss this among themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Blindfold?” she had asked in astonishment, then laughed apologetically. “I don’t seem to be able to converse, do I? I keep repeating what you say. But: blindfold? Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They don’t want you to see the Product when it comes out of you. When you birth it.” The girl pointed to her bulging belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve produced already, right?” she asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl nodded. “Twice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s it like?” Even asking it, she knew it was a somewhat foolish question. They had had classes, seen diagrams, been given instructions. Still, none of that was the same as hearing it from someone who had already gone through the process. And now that they were already disobeying the restriction about discussing it—well, why not ask?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Easier the second time. Didn’t hurt as much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she didn’t respond, the girl looked at her quizzically. “Hasn’t anyone told you it hurts?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They said ‘discomfort.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other girl gave a sarcastic snort. “Discomfort, then. If that’s what they want to call it. Not as much discomfort the second time. And it doesn’t take as long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Vessels? VESSELS!” The voice of the matron, through the speaker, was stern. “Monitor your conversations, please! You know the rules!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl and her companion obediently fell silent then, realizing they had been heard through the microphones embedded in the walls of the dining room. Some of the other girls giggled. They were probably also guilty. There was so little else to talk about. The process—their job, their mission—was the thing they had in common. But the conversation shifted after the stern warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had taken another spoonful of soup. Food in the Birthmothers’ Dormitory was always plentiful and delicious. The Vessels were all being meticulously nourished. Of course, growing up in the community, she had always been adequately fed. Food had been delivered to her family’s dwelling each day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when she had been selected Birthmother at twelve, the course of her life had changed. It had been gradual. The academic courses—math, science, law—at school became less demanding for her group. Fewer tests, less reading required. The teachers paid little attention to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCourses in nutrition and health had been added to her curriculum, and more time was spent on exercise in the outdoor air. Special vitamins had been added to her diet. Her body had been examined, tested, and prepared for her time here. After that year had passed, and part of another, she was deemed ready. She was instructed to leave her family dwelling and move to the Birthmothers’ Dormitory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelocating from one place to another within the community was not difficult. She owned nothing. Her clothing was distributed and laundered by the central clothing supply. Her schoolbooks were requisitioned by the school and would be used for another student the following year. The bicycle she had ridden to school throughout her earlier years was taken to be refurbished and given to a different, younger child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a celebratory dinner her last evening in the dwelling. Her brother, older by six years, had already gone on to his own training in the Department of Law and Justice. They saw him only at public meetings; he had become a stranger. So the last dinner was just the three of them, she and the parental unit who had raised her. They reminisced a bit; they recalled some funny incidents from her early childhood (a time she had thrown her shoes into the bushes and come home from the Childcare Center barefoot). There was laughter, and she thanked them for the years of her upbringing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Were you embarrassed when I was selected for Birthmother?” she asked them. She had, herself, secretly hoped for something more prestigious. At her brother’s selection, when she had been just six, they had all been very proud. Law and Justice was reserved for those of especially keen intelligence. But she had not been a top student.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” her father said. “We trust the committee’s judgment. They knew what you would do best.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And Birthmother is very important,” Mother added. “Without Birthmothers, none of us would be here!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen they wished her well in the future. Their lives were changing too; parents no longer, they would move now into the place where Childless Adults lived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day, she walked alone to the dormitory attached to the Birthing Unit and moved into the small bedroom she was assigned. From its window she could see the school she had attended, and the recreation field beyond. In the distance, there was a glimpse of the river that bordered the community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, several weeks later, after she was settled in and beginning to make friends among the other girls, she was called in for insemination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot knowing what to expect, she had been nervous. But when the procedure was complete, she felt relieved; it had been quick and painless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It that all?” she had asked in surprise, rising from the table when the technician gestured that she should.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s all. Come back next week to be tested and certified.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had laughed nervously. She wished they had explained everything more clearly in the instruction folder they had given her when she was selected. “What does ‘certified’ mean?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe worker, putting away the insemination equipment, seemed a little rushed. There were probably others waiting. “Once they’re sure it implanted,” he explained impatiently, “then you’re a certified Vessel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anything else?” he asked her as he turned to leave. “No? You’re free to go, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat all seemed such a short time ago. Now here she was, nine months later, with the blindfold strapped around her eyes. The discomfort had started some hours before, intermittently; now it was nonstop. She breathed deeply as they had instructed. It was difficult, blinded like this; her skin was hot inside the mask. She tried to relax. To breathe in and out. To ignore the discom—No, she thought. It is pain. It really is pain. Gathering her strength for the job, she groaned slightly, arched her back, and gave herself up to the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer name was Claire. She was fourteen years old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey clustered around her. She could hear them, when her mind was able to focus through the surging intermittent pain. They were talking urgently to each other. Something was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain and again they checked her with their instruments, metallic and cold. A cuff on her arm was inflated, and someone pressed a metal disk there, at her elbow. Then a different device against her stretched and shaking belly. She gasped as another convulsive pain ripped through her. Her hands were tied on either side of the bed. She was unable to move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it supposed to be like this? She tried to ask but her voice was too weak—mumbly and scared—and no one heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Help me,” she whimpered. But their attention, she sensed, was not on her, not really. They were worried about the Product. Their hands and tools were on her taut middle. It had been hours, now, since all this began, the first twinge, then the rhythmic, hardening pain, and later, the buckling on of the mask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Put her out. We’ll have to go in for it.” It was a commanding voice, clearly someone in charge. “Quickly.” There was a startling urgency to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Breathe deeply,” they ordered her, shoving something rubbery up under the mask, holding it to her mouth and nose. She did. She had no choice. She would have suffocated otherwise. She inhaled something with an unpleasantly sweet scent, and immediately the pain subsided, her thoughts subsided, her being drifted away. Her last sensation was the awareness, pain-free, of something cutting into her belly. Carving her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe emerged to a new, different pain, no longer the throbbing agony but now a broad, deep ache. She felt freed, and realized that her wrists were unshackled. She was still on the bed, covered with a warm blanket. Metal rails had been lifted with a clanking sound, so she was protected on either side. The room was empty now. No attendants or technicians, no equipment. Only Claire, alone. She turned tentatively, assessing the emptiness of the room with her eyes, and then tried to lift her head but was forced back by the pain the attempt caused. She couldn’t look down at her own body but carefully moved her hands to rest there on what had been her own taut, swollen belly. It was flat now, bandaged, and very sore. The Product was what they had carved out of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she missed it. She was suffused with a desperate feeling of loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve been decertified.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree weeks had passed. She had recuperated in the Birthing Unit for the first week, tended and checked—pampered a bit, actually, she realized. But there was an awkwardness to everything. There with her were other young women, recovering, so there was pleasant conversation, a few jokes about being slender again. Their bodies, hers as well, were massaged each morning, and their gentle exercise was supervised by the staff. Her recuperation was slower, though, than the others’, for she had been left with a wound and they had not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the first week they were moved to an interim place, where they amused themselves with talk and games before returning two weeks later to the large, familiar group of Vessels. Back they went, to the Dormitory, greeting old friends—many of them larger in size now, their bellies growing as they waited—and taking their places again in the group. They all looked alike, in their shapeless, smocklike dresses, with their identical haircuts; but personalities distinguished them. Nadia was funny, making a joke of everything; Miriam very solemn and shy; Suzanne was organized and efficient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Vessels returned following Production, there was surprisingly little talk of the Task. “How did it go?” someone would ask, and the reply would be a nonchalant shrug, and “All right. Fairly easy.” Or a wry “Not too bad,” with a face indicating that it had not been pleasant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good to have you back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks. How were things here while I was gone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The same. Two new Vessels, just arrived. And Nancy’s gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did she get?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Farm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. She wanted that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was casual talk, inconsequential. Nancy had delivered her third Product not long before. After the third, the Vessels were reassigned. Farm. Clothing Factory. Food Delivery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire remembered that Nancy had hoped for Farm. She liked the outdoors, and a particular friend of hers had been assigned Farm some months before; she hoped to spend the next part of her working life in the company of someone she enjoyed. Claire felt happy for her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/son-the-giver-quartet-4/page-1.html","bookId":1704,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:04 AM"}
