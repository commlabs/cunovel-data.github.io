Nash and Abby were waiting for their various athletic practices to begin, and I was trying to stall until I\u0027d be in the clear to catch up with Brandon and take him to Penny for Your Thoughts. I glanced out one of the windows and spotted a woman with long gray hair and bundled up in a tan parka roaming our campus sidewalk as if she was looking for someone in particular.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pressed my face closer to the glass and recognized it was Dr. Meadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is she doing here?\" Ivy asked, also spotting the psychic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"I better find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would you want to do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI headed down the bleachers and raced ahead before my friends could follow me. I opened the gymnasium doors and caught up to the psychic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t show up at my store. I was concerned something happened to you,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been trying to convince him to see you. It\u0027s taking some time. But I think he will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is great,\" she said. \"But it has to be soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We discovered it\u0027s in his blood,\" I said softly. \"The lycan lineage goes generations back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which one is he?\" she asked. \"No, wait\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;don\u0027t tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then my friends, their beaux, and Nash opened the gymnasium doors. Dr. Meadows pointed to Nash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI half laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must see him at night,\" she said urgently, looking at Nash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s not a full moon again for weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, but this way I can document him before and after. I\u0027ll bring my equipment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Equipment?\" It sounded painful and at the very least intrusive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was desperate to find a cure for Brandon\u0027s condition; however, at what cost I wasn\u0027t sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must have documentation,\" Dr. Meadows said, stumbling on her words. \"It will be okay, I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of documentation?\" I said. \"He needs to sign something?\" I pried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing invasive. Just something I can replay. To make sure what he is experiencing is real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can guarantee you it\u0027s real,\" I said hurriedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy friends were staring at us. Dr. Meadows stared back as if she was examining Nash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she turned her attention to me. \"I need proof in order to find out how to deal with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want my true love to be filmed, hooked up to electrodes or possibly other torture devices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was hoping for a potion,\" I said. \"Or some charm he could wear around his neck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you are hoping for a cure, this is the only way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left Dr. Meadows and returned to my friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is she doing here at school?\" they asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was looking for a werewolf,\" I said truthfully. \"That woman is so crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash continued to watch Dr. Meadows until she got into her car and drove off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I met Brandon after school, I admitted to him that Dr. Meadows had shown up at school and that she wanted to document him. I didn\u0027t want to trick him into doing something he wasn\u0027t prepared for or willing to participate in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does she want to do?\" he asked, anxiously waiting by his Jeep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;she wants to see you soon. Since the full moon won\u0027t be for a few more weeks, she wants a record of you during both times. It could be as simple as asking you questions, or as much as...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure. Ivy and Abby caught up to us and I didn\u0027t want them to find out what Dr. Meadows was saying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She might want to take pictures or film me?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hung my head low. \"I\u0027m not sure what her plans are. All I know is that\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;uh, I don\u0027t know anything.\" And I was as unsure as Brandon was about whether he should go and meet with her. But today I wanted him to meet Mr. Worthington. Maybe Pine Tree Village might have more answers for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hopped into Brandon\u0027s Jeep and headed out his private drive and out of Riverside. We were stopped at the traffic light by the school when I noticed the car next to us was Nash\u0027s. I ducked down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" Brandon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Nash. He\u0027s in the car next to us. I don\u0027t want him to see me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you weren\u0027t seeing him anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what\u0027s the big deal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light changed and Nash tore off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat up. Brandon pulled into the lot of a nearby park.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to take you back,\" he said, turning the steering wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to go back. I want you to meet Mr. Worthington.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can find him on my own,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry. I just reacted without thinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Brandon was hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said. \"Everything has been happening so fast, that\u0027s all.\" It was so unfair. I ran the risk of losing my lifelong friends for a guy I\u0027d only known a short time. I wasn\u0027t sure what to do. I just knew I wanted all of them in my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t blame you, Celeste. I don\u0027t want to put you in a position you aren\u0027t ready to be in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon pushing me away only made my need to be with him even greater. Overcome with sadness, I turned away from him and stared out the window. A couple strolled hand in hand in the park. The girl snuggled up to her boyfriend as he gazed back adoringly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must hate me,\" I said. \"I invited you to a party where you didn\u0027t have a good time. You saved me from a wolf pack that left your hand maimed. I make you feel like an outsider in your own car. And the worst thing of all\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;because of that moonlit kiss\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;you\u0027ve turned into a - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon took my chin and drew me to him. \"It\u0027s okay, Celeste. I think you feel you have the world\u0027s problems on your shoulders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brushed my hair away from my face. \"You don\u0027t have to worry so much about what is right for Ivy, Nash, or me. Just what is right for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon was the first guy I\u0027d ever met who understood me. If I turned away from him now, I knew I\u0027d regret it for the rest of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, take me with you to see Mr. Worthington.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon parked the Jeep at Pine Tree Village Retirement Community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we entered the building we heard a commotion coming from one of the hallways and nurses were running to someone\u0027s aid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly there was the sound of an ambulance pulling up outside. Paramedics wheeled in a gurney to the assisted living floor. I dashed down the hallway, my own heart almost stopping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe paramedics parked the gurney next to Mr. Worthington\u0027s door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears welled up in my eyes. I turned to Brandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe color had washed out of his face. He\u0027d been so close to finding a relative he\u0027d never known and an answer to his condition that perhaps no one else could reveal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held on to my shoulder and I melted into his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then Mr. Worthington stepped out of his room. I almost fainted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re alive!\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope so,\" he answered. \"This place isn\u0027t my idea of heaven.\" He told us that Mr. Lucas, his ninety-three-year-old next-door neighbor, had fallen and broken his hip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was surely unhappy to hear that Mr. Lucas was hurt\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;but grateful to know Mr. Worthington was all right. I gave the elderly man a hug so hard, I was afraid I might break him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have someone I\u0027d like you to meet,\" I said, and we walked into his room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a boyfriend?\" he said, trying to make me blush. \"I knew there was something different about you... I told you that before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I was blushing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Brandon Maddox,\" I said to Mr. Worthington, pleased to introduce the two. \"His mother is Claire Worthington. This is your great-grandson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Worthington\u0027s face went white, as if he\u0027d just seen a werewolf. I was afraid he was going to have a heart attack right there and then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon extended his wounded hand to shake. Mr. Worthington eyed the scar and gently shook Brandon\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t seen you since you were a little baby,\" Mr. Worthington said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so glad to meet you\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I mean see you... again.\" Brandon smiled. \"My father said my mother\u0027s family moved away from Legend\u0027s Run.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We all did,\" said Mr. Worthington. \"But I moved back a short time ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Worthington and Brandon sat together. I beamed with delight as my two friends began to converse. Brandon didn\u0027t look like the lonely guy in our high school lunchroom or a lone wolf in the woods anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mother was a gorgeous girl,\" Mr. Worthington began. \"We were all thrilled when she got married and settled down. I only met your father a few times, but I remember him as being a brilliant man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Brandon said. \"He\u0027s a scientist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After you were born, she seemed to get restless. Maybe she couldn\u0027t handle the good things in life. And then she left, and we never heard from her again. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I always said it was in her blood. Something wild, not normal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think it might be the trait of your great-grandfather?\" I asked, hinting toward Brandon\u0027s nocturnal condition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I always blamed him for the Worthington wild streak. But we all have to take responsibility for our own actions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree with you,\" Brandon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t tell him what I told you yesterday?\" Mr. Worthington asked, almost embarrassed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sort of...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, no one believes an old man,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do,\" Brandon said. \"I believe you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Worthington\u0027s face lit up. \"You are the spitting image of my son, Harry. He believed in ghost stories, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was your great-grandfather ever cured?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, and that\u0027s why I was always convinced it ran in our blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate your taking the time to talk to me,\" Brandon said politely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all I have is time. Besides, it is so nice to finally have family in Legend\u0027s Run again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon extended his hand again. Mr. Worthington took it and hugged Brandon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like us to meet again,\" Brandon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like that, too,\" Mr. Worthington said. \"You know where to find me. I\u0027m here twenty-four hours a day.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-in-a-full-moon-full-moon-1/page-24.html","bookId":2148,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:03 PM"}
