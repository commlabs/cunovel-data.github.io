So hard at moments, as if she had lost all feeling. Then, suddenly warm and lit with wry amusement. Some part of him believed he was responsible for those glimpses of the private woman. Those ephemeral sightings made him want to see more of her, all of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward growled. He was used to having what he wanted. A modest man, he rarely wanted much and never anything beyond his means. The attraction he felt toward Corinne defied reason. They had nothing in common. What was the lure?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was damaged. The bruised and haunted look that wracked her features after he’d kissed her bespoke deep scarring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone had abused her terribly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFury coiled tight within him. Her past was no deterrent. Instead, it made him want her more. The desire to protect her was as powerful as the desire to mate with her. He wanted rights to her. More precisely, he wanted the right to find those responsible and mete out the justice they deserved for damaging such perfection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDangerous thoughts, dangerous feelings. They had no place in his regimented and orderly life, just as Corinne had no place there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA scream rent the night, one so filled with terror it stopped him midstride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to face the manse again, seeing nothing amiss from the front, but certain the sound had emanated from there. He was frowning at the elegant, columned façade when more screams disturbed the peaceful eventide. He set off at a run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe liveried footmen and groomsmen standing at the front drive left their stations and sprinted up the stairs before him. The moment the door opened, thick, black smoke roiled out. The four servants paused on the threshold, gaping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fetch buckets from the stables!” Edward ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir.” The two groomsmen ran back down the stairs and around the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shouldered his way in front of the remaining horrified footmen. “You two, come with me. We must make certain everyone vacates the house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether, they plunged into the wall of smoke. Intolerable heat assailed them, the flames fed by the newly opened door. Struggling to see through watering eyes, Edward drew in a choked breath and stumbled as scorching, soot-filled air burned his throat and singed his lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was suffocating by the time they reached the ballroom, a journey hampered by the need to feel along the wall to find their way. They split up when they reached their destination, groping their way through the many planters and columns in search of anyone yet to flee. Black smoke rolled in through the doorway behind them in ever-expanding plumes. It tumbled across the soaring ceiling and began to lower in a malevolent cloud. Edward’s heart raced madly, his hands swiping impatiently at the tears that stung his heat-sensitized cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurely Corinne would be safe. She’d left when he did. She was most likely home now, cursing him to Hades.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank God. He would be insane if she was here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. James! Mr. James!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward altered course, moving in the direction of the hoarse, unrecognizable voice calling out to him. A moment later, Comte Desjardins lurched into view from the depths of the cloying, burning smoke. His thin frame was wracked by violent coughing and he lunged at Edward, catching him by the shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Corinne,” the comte gasped, his reddened eyes glistening with near-hysteria. “Is she with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chill swept down Edward’s spine, in spite of the intense heat. “No, she left.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you certain? S-she was . . . to ride with me—” Desjardins coughed so forcibly that black spittle coated his lips. “. . . retiring room . . .” he wheezed. “. . . have not seen her . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dear God.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward grabbed the comte’s arm and dragged him out to the terrace, where the rest of the guests gathered. Then, he ran around the side of the manse, searching for windows with light, fighting a rising panic that threatened to paralyze him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA woman in white stood outside an open window from which tendrils of smoke wafted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go to the others,” he ordered. “On the rear lawn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated, her masked face gazing up at the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now!” he barked, in a tone no sane person refused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding reluctantly, the masked woman lifted her skirts and moved toward the rear of the house. Edward heard a distant scream at the same moment a masculine leg appeared over the sill. Assured of the safety of the woman’s paramour, he darted for the side gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo Corinne. Where in hell was she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward sprinted around the front of the manse and burst through the gate on the other side, narrowly skirting the stairs that led down to the delivery entrance. He was halfway along the length of the manse when he spotted Desjardins gesturing frantically before a window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is she in there?” Edward rasped through his burned throat, skidding to a halt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied the window through gritty eyes. Shadows danced sinuously against the glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmoke. Too much of it. He could not see into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I saw movement,” the comte croaked. “Perhaps—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe window exploded outward in a shower of broken glass, forcing them to duck beneath crossed forearms. A chair crashed to the ground with a splintering thud and smoke poured out the newly created orifice. A second later, flames that had been hugging the ceiling of the room lunged for the night air, licking outward along the manse walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Corinne!” Edward roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only reply was the crackle of fire eating everything in its path. After the initial burst of oxygen-starved flames, the blaze retreated back into the room, spurring him into action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward spun around and caught up the damaged chair. With a mighty heave, he thrust the cracked rear legs into the flower bed and supported the padded damask back against the manse wall. He shrugged out of his coat and wrapped it around his forearm, then climbed atop the wobbly seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Corinne!” he yelled, his damaged lungs seizing in protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning his head away to protect his face, Edward used his shielded arm to knock away the jagged glass that rimmed the broken sash frame. One thick piece was too firmly anchored and it sliced through his coat, shirtsleeves, and into the flesh beneath. He hissed, but refused to turn away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Corinne!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer precious face appeared, streaked with soot and trailed with tears. Corinne’s pale hair clung to her reddened skin in sweat-soaked tendrils and her nose ran copiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had never seen anything so lovely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Christ,” he gasped, near dizzy with relief. “Come out of there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“James,” she whispered, her shoulders coming into view as she pushed weakly to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdmiration for her strength filled him. He knew how much it must have taxed her to break the glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, love. Come to me.” He held his arms out to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swayed haphazardly and toppled out the window in a dead faint, her voluminous skirts catching in the protruding shards of the broken pane and tearing with a hideous rending noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward caught her and tumbled off the collapsing chair, twisting his body to absorb the entirety of the impact on his back. The breath was knocked from his beleaguered lungs. His spectacles were knocked from his head and, if he was not mistaken, presently crushed beneath him, but Corinne was in his arms, alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor now. She required the care of a physician immediately. Every breath she took rattled in her lungs and bubbled back out in black ooze upon her bloodless lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoughing through his charred throat, Edward accepted the comte’s minimal assistance to regain his footing with Corinne held securely in his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gathered the tattered remnants of her gown and strode quickly toward the front of the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon raced toward the rear of the manse. He had checked every window as he passed it, searching for the source of the scream he’d heard just moments ago. He could not reach her through the door, but perhaps he could find her still. He had to try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clanging of bells carried news of the fire through the city. The night air smelled of char and heat, and sobbing told the tale of woe that ended an event meant for revelry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached the rear lawn and saw a handful of servants running to and fro with sloshing buckets of water from the stables. The stunned and terrified guests huddled in various-sized groups, paralyzed and useless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Halt!” Simon roared, his voice carrying through the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe servants paused, gasping, their buckets more than half-empty from the jostling required to cover the distance from the mew to the manse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon gained the terrace, then leaped atop the wide marble edge of the fountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They cannot battle this blaze alone,” he yelled, gesturing to the servants. “Every able-bodied man must assist if we are to end this! There are others trapped inside in need of rescue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one moved at first. Simon searched the huddled mass and spotted a young man of seemingly fine physical condition. “You,” he ordered, pointing with his finger, “come here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a brief hesitation before the man came forward. He was disheveled, his shirtsleeves hastily tucked into his doeskin breeches, his waistcoat and coat unbuttoned. From the cut and quality of his garments, Simon was certain he was a member of the peerage. But Simon did not care. Rank had no bearing in his mind when lives were at stake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrabbing his elbow, Simon lined him up by the terrace doors. He looked about and more men approached under the weight of his condemning stare. Some were sluggish and reluctant, but as the line formed from the door to the fountain, the level of enthusiasm displayed increased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimon grabbed a bucket from a servant, plunged it into the fountain, and passed it to the first man in line. It moved down, man-to-man, the participants gradually moving forward until the procession stretched from the interior gallery door where the fire raged to the terrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf their own accord, the men changed positions—the lead man retreating to the cool air of the outdoors with an empty bucket, while the second man stepped up and discharged his ration of water before retreating to collect more and pass it along the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the water was flowing steadily into the house, Simon risked a glance toward the lawn and saw Lysette standing with two other women, watching him from behind the crimson mask. Relief filled him at the sight of her safe and unharmed, her white gown glimmering like a pearl in the moonlight. Then his relief was replaced by fear. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/don-t-tempt-me-georgian-4/page-17.html","bookId":2661,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:55:39 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:55:39 AM"}
