{"id":21320,"no":69,"title":"BOOK V ALMOST UNDER Chapter 1","content":"Reuben did not go back to Cheat Land for several weeks. Those five minutes had been too much for him. He would never again risk putting himself in the power of things he did not understand. Besides, he felt vaguely that after what had happened Alice would not want to see him. She had humiliated herself, or rather he had humiliated her—for she had put out in one swift dark minute all the powers of her nature to bind him, and she had failed. He remembered her voice when she whispered, \"But not too late,\" and her eyes afterwards, smouldering in shadow, and her little hands held out to him.... There had been nothing definite, obvious, or masterful, yet in those few words and actions her whole self had pleaded on its knees—and he had turned away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But sometimes what kept him from her more than the thought of her humiliation was the thought of his own. For sometimes it seemed almost as if she had humbled him more than he had humbled her. He could not tell whether this sick feeling of shame which occasionally swamped him was due to the fact that he had so nearly surrendered to her or to the fact that he had not quite done so. Sometimes he thought it was the latter. The whole thing was ridiculous and perplexing, a lesson to him not to adventure into subtleties but to keep in communion with the broad plain things of earth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\n\u003cbr\u003e Early in May he found a visit to Cheat Land forced upon him. Jury wanted to buy a cow of his, but one of the sudden chills to which he was liable kept him indoors. Reuben was anxious to sell the animal, and, there being one or two weak points about her, would trust nobody but himself with the negotiations. However, the visit would be quite safe, for he was not likely to see Alice alone, indeed it was probable that he might not see her at all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On reaching the farm he heard several voices in the kitchen, and found the invalid in an arm-chair by the fire, talking to an oldish man and a rather plump pretty girl of about twenty. Jury was an intellectual, incompetent-looking fellow, who seemed elderly, but at the same time gave one the impression that this was due to his health. His grey hair straggled over temples where the skin was stretched tight and yellow as parchment, his cheeks were hollow, his eyes astonishingly like his daughter\u0027s. He was one of the arguments against the marriage.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Alice had let Reuben in. She looked a little tired, but otherwise quite cheerful, and she welcomed him simply and naturally.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This is Miss Lardner,\" she said, introducing him to the girl, \"and Mr. Lardner of Starvecrow.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I heard as how Starvecrow had been bought at last,\" said Reuben; \"not a bad farm, Muster, if you\u0027re fur green crops mostly.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Potatoes,\" said Lardner, \"potatoes—if farmers \u0027ud only grow potatoes and not think so much of grain and rootses, we shudn\u0027t hear of so many of \u0027em going bust.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The conversation became agricultural, but in spite of the interest such a topic always had for him, Reuben could not help watching the two girls. Miss Lardner, whom Alice called Rose, was a fine creature, so different from the other as to make the contrast almost laughable. She was tall and strapping—in later life she might[Pg 245] become over stout, but at present her figure was splendid, superbly moulded and erect. She looked like a young goddess as she sat there, one leg crossed over the other, showing her white stocking almost to the knee. There was something arrogant in her attitude, as if she was aware of the splendour of her body, and gloried in it. Her face too was beautiful—though less classically so—rather broad, with high flat cheek-bones, and a wide full-lipped mouth which would have given it almost a Creole look, if it had not been for her short delicate nose and her fair ruddiness. Her hair seemed to hesitate between gold and brown—her eyes between boldness and languor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Reuben found himself glancing at her continually, and though she seldom met his eyes, he knew that she was aware of his scrutiny. He sometimes felt that Alice was aware of it too.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As the conversation wore on, and became more general, Lardner said something about going over to Snailham and taking Rose home on the way.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, no, Uncle—I don\u0027t want to go. Alice has asked me to stay to supper.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But you can\u0027t go home alone, and I can\u0027t wait wud you, surelye.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll take Miss Lardner home,\" said Reuben.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Directly he had said the words, he looked over at Rose to see how she would receive them. Her eyelashes lay black and curly against her cheek, then they lifted slowly, and her eyes looked out from under the half-raised lids with a kind of demure roguishness. At the same time her lower lip seemed to quiver and plump out, while the corners of her mouth rose and curled. He suddenly felt a desire to plant a kiss fairly on that wet red mouth, which from away across the room seemed to pout towards him.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59441.html","bookId":524,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 1:00:29 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 1:00:29 PM"}
