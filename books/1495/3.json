And who were they acting for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHu Yue’er had stood up and, hand on her waist, gazed at Liu Changjie. “Let me ask you, if there really was a husband and wife who met a person like you, what would happen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question seemed to stump Liu Changjie. He stared blankly for a while before finally responding, “I’m not a good person, but I really wouldn’t do something so unethical.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t say you,” said Hu Yue’er. “I said a person like you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie laughed bitterly. “Well then, I have no idea. I never thought about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The plan was thought up by you, wasn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie’s expression suddenly became very serious. “It was all to convince Dragon Fifth that I’m a bastard. We can’t let him have any suspicions, so we have to be cautious at all times. He’s too powerful, and has spies everywhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But just now …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just now one of his spies was here. The driver is definitely one of his men.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I could tellt.” He offered further explanation: “If that fellow was a real driver, as soon as he caught sight of two boxes of pure white silver, he would have been tempted beyond control. But, it seems that he is used to such things, and was completely unfazed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHu Yue’er thought for a moment, and then laughed. “I’ve heard you had quite the enjoyable time recently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a bitter laugh, Liu Changjie said, “I got my nose broken, you think that was enjoyable?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As long as you can have the company of women every day, getting beaten up is worth it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie sighed. “Unfortunately, none of those women could measure up to you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop trying to butter me up,” laughed Hu Yue’er. “You know you can’t pull a fast one on me. Until the matter is settled, you can forget about laying your hands on me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not even one hand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Starting today, I sleep on the bed, you sleep on the floor. And if you even think about trying to secretly climb into the bed during the night, I’ll go tell Dragon Fifth all the details of your past.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re simply not human. You’re a demon!” \u0026nbsp;\u003ca href\u003d\"#footnote_1\"\u003e[1]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re just as bad, you womanizer.” \u0026nbsp;\u003ca href\u003d\"#footnote_2\"\u003e[2]\u003c/a\u003e She laughed and gave him a wink. “Actually, you’re just a street, and I’m the moonlight. Moonlight can shine on millions of streets, so I guess I’m just born to mess with you.” \u0026nbsp;\u003ca href\u003d\"#footnote_3\"\u003e[3]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. “I always thought it was strange that you were selected to be my assistant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tilted her head. “Because I’m the daughter of ‘Power of Hu’ Patriarch Hu. And because I’m capable, clever, I understand everything, I know everything…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because,” interrupted Liu Changjie, “you’re not just a crafty girl, you’re also sexy!” \u0026nbsp;\u003ca href\u003d\"#footnote_4\"\u003e[4]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was actually quite proper to call her crafty, considering her father was known as one of the craftiest people in Jianghu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust hearing the name “Power of Hu” would make most people tremble with consternation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I also think it’s strange,” she laughed coldly. “Why does my father always say that only you can take on Dragon Fifth? And why do I need to help you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because,” laughed Liu Changjie, “my martial arts are very powerful, I’m intelligent and capable, and I never brag or show off. But, almost no one in Jianghu has ever seen me. Furthermore, I have very few weaknesses, and lots of strengths. Clearly the old man wants me to be his son-in-law.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHu Yue’er glared at him. “Maybe it’s because you know how to shoot your mouth, and you’re also full of crap.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the words were out of her mouth, she couldn’t help but laugh loudly. But only a moment later her face was like stone. “Have you already met with Dragon Fifth?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Twice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why didn’t you capture him? Why let such a good opportunity slip past?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I was as stupid as you, and actually tried to do that, you’d be looking at a dead Liu Changjie right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed coldy. “Don’t you have really good martial arts? Don’t you count as one of the greatest masters under heaven? My father and his friends are constantly singing your praises. Patriarch Wang even treats you like his own son. What reason do you have to be afraid of other people?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not afraid of other people,” he said solemnly. “I’m afraid of Dragon Fifth!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked. “Are his martial arts really as frightening as the legends say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe more frightening. I can only say that even counting the grandmasters of the Seven Great Sword Schools, no one exists in Jianghu who could withstand his 200 stances.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t respond. Instead he said, “Not to mention that he has the assistance of someone who is extremely frightening.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lan Tianmeng?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That lion is already old,” he laughed, “and he’s been kept in a cage for too long. He can still bite, but his teeth aren’t as sharp as they used to be, and his spirit has been worn down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHu Yue’er’s eyes turned up in thought. “It’s said that Dragon Fifth has a lion, a tiger, and a peacock working for him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The lion is old, the black tiger has gone into retirement, and the peacock is beautiful but doesn’t bite.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you’re not talking about them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, who then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a middle-aged man who wears a green robe and white stockings. He seems to follow rules like a flunky, but his martial arts are deep. Profoundly deep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How could you tell?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When the lion made his move against me, the power of his palm was shocking. It was so powerful that everything in the room was shaking. But the middle-aged man just stood calmly to the side. His clothes weren’t even moving.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continued to think. “When he poured wine for me, I looked at his hand. I don’t think I’ve ever seen such a steady hand before. The wine pot he was holding was very heavy, and he seemed to be just randomly pouring, but he poured each cup perfectly, not spilling even a single drop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHu Yue’er listened carefully and then sat for a while in contemplation. “Were you able to tell what kind of weapon he uses from looking at his hand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I couldn’t. His hand didn’t have even a single mark on it to indicate that he practices martial arts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn’t matter what kind of weapon a person uses, their hands would definitely develop calluses. Which in turn is not something easily concealed from a perceptive person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Could it be that he uses the other hand?” she muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Possibly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Among the left-handed masters in the martial arts word, who is the best?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie laughed. “That’s a question for you. Aren’t you the living record book of the masters of the martial arts world?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt really was one of Hu Yue’er’s best skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe not only had a highly retentive memory, she also was extremely knowledgeable. This was probably due to the fact that her father was one of the most intelligent and well-known persons in Jianghu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegarding the history and stories of Jianghu, there was very little she didn’t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As far as famous left-handed kung fu masters go, the most amazing is definitely Qin Huhua.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Flower Protecting blade?” said Liu Changjie, surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHu Yue’er nodded. “It’s said that the first time he killed was when he was nine years old. It was the notorious Central Plains bandit, Tiger Peng.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I’ve heard the story.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was already famous by the time he was thirteen years old. By seventeen, he’d already defeated everyone in the Central Plains, and was called the Central Plains Number One Blade. When he was thirty-one years of age, he took over leadership of the Kongtong Sect, and became the youngest grandmaster in the history of the Seven Great Sword Schools. By that time, it was said that he had defeated over 650 masters of the martial arts world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There can’t be many people in Jianghu who have created more of a sensation than him,” exclaimed Liu Changjie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He became famous when he was young, and showed off his talents to the extreme. His skills were incredible, people couldn’t help but admire him.” Her eyes shone as she continued, “If only I’d been born a dozen or so years sooner, I definitely would have figured out a way to marry him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thankfully, you weren’t born a dozen or so years sooner, otherwise I would have to find him and challenge him to a fight to the death!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHu Yue’er rolled her eyes. “Unfortunately, the person you mentioned is definitely not him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How could someone as proud as him become somebody else’s lackey? In any case, he’s been missing for years, his whereabouts are completely unknown. Some people say that he traveled across the sea and became an immortal. Others say he died. But regardless of whether he’s living or dead, he definitely wouldn’t be pouring someone else’s wine for them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie let out a breath. “I really hope it isn’t him. I definitely don’t want to have that kind of opponent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice suddenly stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the same moment that his voice stopped, his body was pressed down onto Hu Yue’er.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was impossible to see his movement; who would ever think that he had such ability?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Hu Yue’er would never have thought it possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBaring her teeth and struggling against him, she said, “You pervert, I’m telling you…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice suddenly stopped, as Liu Changjie’s mouth covered hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could only emit sound from her nose. An experienced man knew the type of sound a woman would make in this situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a sound that, if a man heard it, all the bones in his body would become weak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was pushing him back, struggling, clearly wanting to hit him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut her hands were being held down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face was burning red, and her whole body was as hot as if it were on fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat other reaction would one expect from a healthy, mature woman being held down by a man she has feelings for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, at that exact moment, a banging sound rang out, and the door crashed open as someone kicked their way in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA person charged in, carrying a horse-cutter sword in hand. Surprisingly, it was the young carriage driver. \u0026nbsp;\u003ca href\u003d\"#footnote_5\"\u003e[5]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie was still pressed down on Hu Yue’er’s body, although his lips had left hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver stood inside the bedroom door, staring at them icily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis posture was stable, and he gripped his sword skillfully. Anyone could see that his sword skill was anything but weak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his callous eyes could be seen a mocking look. “I drove in a big circle outside,” he laughed. “And after all that time you still haven’t gotten her in bed? Seems like you really aren’t very good at handling women.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie replied, “I’ve still got plenty of time left. I’m not a little boy like you, what’s the hurry?” It seemed as if he suddenly realized that he didn’t need to explain himself, and his face became very serious. “Why did you come back?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver’s face was also serious. “To kill you!” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie seemed shocked. “Why do you want to kill me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver laughed coldly. “I’ve been working for him for eighteen years, and I’ve been destitute the entire time. I can only afford the dirtiest brothels and most disgusting whores. I finally have a chance to hit it big. You have a problem with that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie knew who he worked for, but he deliberately asked, “Don’t tell me you’re also one of Dragon Fifth’s men?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you were the least bit perceptive,” he responded stonily, “you would know what kind of person Peng Gang is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean ‘Whirlwind Blade’ Peng Gang?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never imagined you would know anything, let alone me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Five-tiger Gate-breaking Sword School’s highest ranking disciple relegated to driving others in a carriage! Isn’t that just too insulting?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeng Gang gripped his sword so hard that the veins in his hand began to pop out. His forehead pulsed as he gritted his teeth and said, “I will never again allow others to treat me like bird shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, you plan to kill me, take the silver and the woman, and flee to some distant place?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeng Gang’s eyes fell on Hu Yue’er’s dainty, gasping mouth. His eyes seemed to shine with fire. “Any man would want to have a good time with a young widow like her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as she heard the words “young widow,” Hu Yue’er called out, “You … what did you do with the man of the house?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeng Gang laughed maliciously. “For the kind of man who is so willing to sell his wife, dying eight times wouldn’t be enough. Don’t tell me you miss him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he even finished speaking, Hu Yue’er started weeping. It looked completely realistic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie let out a breath, apparently unwilling to move away from her body. “This woman isn’t a goddess,” he muttered. “Penniless, willing to sell herself for a little silver, she’s really not worth it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you had any skill at all,” laughed Peng Gang, “you wouldn’t have been beaten half to death like a dog and hung from the eaves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you think you can beat me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know what’s going on. You got beaten up, then suddenly show up with all that silver!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie sighed. “You really are just an ignorant kid who doesn’t know a damned thing. I really couldn’t bear to kill you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then you might as well let me kill you!” shouted Peng Gang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis sword chopped forward, the first stance containing five movements. The Five-tiger Gate-breaking Sword was one of the martial world’s most sinister and feared sword techniques, and “Whirlwind Blade” Peng Gang’s speed was anything but slow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie didn’t counterattack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed like he did make any move at all to avoid the blow, and yet Peng Gang’s sword somehow couldn’t touch him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHu Yue’er appeared to be so frightened that she couldn’t even cry, and had rolled into a ball in the corner of the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeng Gang’s move was very quick, and Liu Changjie was forced to retreat backwards toward the corner of the room. Suddenly the sword chopped up from below, seeming to come from three different directions, slicing rapidly toward the left side of Liu Changjie’s neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was “Heaven and Earth Inverted,” one of the Five-tiger Gate-breaking Sword’s killing moves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie could not retreat any further backwards. In an instant, his body had slid directly up the wall, all the way to the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dinging sound rang out, and sparks flew in all directions. Peng Gang had mistakenly assumed the move would result in a fatality. He had used all his strength, and could not pull back the sword, which embedded itself deeply into the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wrenched the sword free, but at that exact moment a hand crashed through the wall from outside and grabbed the blade of the sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wall was made from bricks, but the hand moved through it as though it were soft clay. The fingers twisted gently, and sword, crafted from fine steel, snapped into two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeng Gang’s face lost its color, his body stiffened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a worldly-wise person, but this type of martial arts he’d simply never heard of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cold voice rang out from the other side of the wall. “You were with Dragon Fifth for eighteen years, and you earned about seventy or eighty silver per month. But this man suddenly gets tens of thousands, and you think you know what’s going on. Is that right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeng Gang’s face was ashen as he nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe person outside obviously couldn’t see him nod, so Liu Changjie called out, “He says yes!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But, Mr. Liu was beaten up by Grandpa Lan and then made friends with Meng Fei. Anyone who calls Meng Fei a friend is an enemy of ours. How do you know where the silver came from?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeng Gang hesitated, and then finally responded, “I know that Meng Fei doesn’t have those kind of resources. Also, that day I saw the young master in Meng Fei’s village.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never imagined that you were so intelligent,” responded the voice insipidly, “or that you paid such close attention to details.” Only someone who paid attention to detail would notice things that were invisible to others. “Unfortunately, you have done something extremely stupid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe source of the voice was outside, but it sounded as though it was directly next to Peng Gang’s ear. It continued, “Even though you’re perfectly aware that Liu Changjie is one of us, you still want to kill him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeng Gang lowered his head. Sweat dripped down like rain. “I made a mistake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know what your mistake was?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I … I violated the family regulations!” As the words left his mouth, it seemed as though all the energy in his body had been depleted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know what happens to people who violate the family regulations?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeng Gang’s face was twisted with fear. It seemed like two invisible hands were gripping his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly turned, apparently making an effort to flee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clearly thought that the person outside couldn’t see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was as if the hand itself had eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hand flicked, and the half-blade flew forward in a flash, embedding itself in Peng Gang’s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that exact instant, four muscular men flew into the room. One of them carried a large burlap sack, into which he began stuffing Peng Gang’s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother carried two boxes of silver, which he deposited onto the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third carried an iron tool, which he immediately used to repair the door frame so recently destroyed by Peng Gang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fourth carried a batch of masonry clay. He immediately set to work patching the hole in the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guarantee that you won’t be bothered again in the next seven days,” said the voice outside the wall. “But you had best remember, you aren’t really one of us. You have no connection to the Dragon family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice faded off into the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hole in the wall was patched, the door frame was repaired, the burlap sack was wrapped up. Not even a drop of blood could be seen on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the entire time, the four large men hadn’t even glanced at Liu Changjie. And by the time the voice disappeared, so had they.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was quite again, as if nothing had happened at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese people were precise and efficient, beyond the imagination of most. But at this point, what was not beyond imagination was the fate of anyone who violated the regulations of Dragon Fifth’s family!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart 3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie didn’t move, didn’t even open his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither did Hu Yue’er move, nor open her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only sound that could be heard was that of rustling tree leaves, hens clucking, and dogs barking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was suddenly very hot inside the room. Liu Changjie slowly unclasped the front of his garment and then lay down on top of Hu Yue’er.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprisingly, she didn’t kick him away, but instead just stared at him with her large eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seems she finally understood how frightening Dragon Fifth truly was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re gone,” said Liu Changjie. “All gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“These seven days, they really won’t come back?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That man doesn’t seem like the kind of person who speaks idly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know who he is?” asked Hu Yue’er. “Did you recognize the hand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hand was a right hand, and on it was no vestige to indicate the person had martial arts training. However, anyone could see that if the owner of that hand wanted to kill someone, very few people in the world could offer any resistance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope I didn’t mistake what I saw.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You hope it’s the green-robed man?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because if it is him, it means that sometimes he’s not with Dragon Fifth. When I make my move, I really hope he’s not there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When are you going to make your move?” asked Hu Yue’er.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll wait until he completely trusts me,” replied Liu Changjie. “I’ll wait until he presents an opportunity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You believe that day will come?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It will,” replied Liu Changjie resolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHu Yue’er sighed. “I’m afraid a lot of people will have died by the time that day comes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re feeling bad about Stone?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stone was an honest person,” she said sadly. “This was supposed to be his last assignment. When it was over, he was going to return to his hometown and start farming. He even bought some land already.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStone was the man who had been playing the role of her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie listened quietly. “He shouldn’t have bought a house and land,” he said emotionlessly. “People like us are bound to meet death at some point along the road.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but he died so unfairly.” She closed her eyes. “His kung fu is just as good as that bastard Peng Gang’s. But when Peng Gang attacked, he couldn’t defend himself, otherwise he would have revealed our secret. Only … only by dying could he keep the secret safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He did what he had to do,” said Liu Changjie calmly. “That was his duty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHu Yue’er’s eyes opened. “Are you saying he was supposed to die?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you human or not!” she cried. “Do you have any heart in you at all? You … you ….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she spoke she seemed to get more and more mad, and then suddenly she kicked Liu Changjie off the bed and onto the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie laughed. “If you think Stone was an honest person, then you’re wrong. And if you think he died at the hands of that bastard, then you’re even more wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laid on the ground, looking just as comfortable as he had been on the bed. “Maybe he just let Peng Gang land a couple blows to make him think he was dead. If he really let himself get killed by that runt bastard in just one blow, then he shouldn’t be called Stone, he should be called Tofu.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHu Yue’er seemed suspicious. “You really think he’s alive?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know how important this assignment is? Do you know how much time we spent planning it? If Stone was as honest as you imagine, how could he participate?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHu Yue’er laughed. “I don’t know about other people, I just know that you are definitely not an honest person.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHu Yue’er bit down on her lip. “You know, even if you heard someone outside earlier, you didn’t need to do what you did. You were just taking advantage of the situation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie laughed. “You’re half right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean you had other intentions?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while, he said, “I just wanted you to understand that if I really wanted to force myself on you, there’s really nothing you could do about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHu Yue’er rolled her eyes. “Don’t tell me … you don’t want to?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t tell me you want me to try again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to blush, and began gnawing on her lip again. “You wouldn’t dare!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie laughed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, he flew onto the bed, pressing down onto Hu Yue’er.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gasped. “You really are a pervert!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But this time you intentionally seduced me. I know that you…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he could finish, he suddenly flew out of the bed, slammed into the wall, and fell onto the floor, clutching his stomach. His face was pale white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHu Yue’er looked at him. “Yes, I was seducing you on purpose. Because I wanted you to understand that if I’m not willing, there’s really nothing you could do about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie twisted his waist. It looked like he was hurt so bad that he couldn’t even speak. Sweat dripped down his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegret suddenly flashed in Hu Yue’er’s eyes. “But,” she said softly, “it’s like you already said before. Until this assignment is finished, I … I …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said nothing more, and she didn’t need to. Even an idiot should be able to understand what she was getting at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet it seemed that Liu Changjie didn’t understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slowly reclined, lying down on the floor. Whereas before his face had been friendly and happy, now it was filled with sorrow and misery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing. He just lay there silently for a very long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHu Yue’er’s heart was soft. With a calm face, she said, “I know I kicked you, but you don’t have to lie on the floor like a child and refuse to get up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept his silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you really mad at me?” she asked. “Or are you just thinking?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed softly. “I was just thinking that you’re father will definitely find a great man for you. Someone who doesn’t do what we do, someone who isn’t constantly courting death. We …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHu Yue’er’s expression suddenly changed. “What is that supposed to mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie laughed emptily. “It doesn’t mean anything. I just hope that you can grow old together happily, and eventually forget about me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHu Yue’er’s face was white as a ghost. “Why are you talking like this? Didn’t you understand what I was talking about just now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understood,” he said with a sigh. “It’s just, I don’t think I can wait until that day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The day I accepted this assignment,” he said dully, “I also accepted that I would die. Even if I have the chance to kill Dragon Fifth, I … I will never have a chance to see you again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes stared at nothing, and a mournful expression filled his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHu Yue’er looked at him, and from the expression on her face, it seemed that there must be needles stabbing through her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie couldn’t help but laugh again. “Regardless of anything else, if I’m able to exchange my life for Dragon Fifth’s, it will be worth it. I’m a nobody, really. No family. No …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHu Yue’er didn’t let him finish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe threw herself onto him, her soft, tender lips covering his….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind blew harder outside.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moon was out, and the moonlight shown in through the window onto Hu Yue’er’s face. Her face was slightly flushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie glanced at her furtively, his eyes filled with joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHu Yue’er gazed at the moon. Suddenly, she spoke. “I know you tricked me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I tricked you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again, she bit down on her lip. “You deliberately said all that stuff to soften me up. You … you just took the opportunity to bully me. I obviously know you’re not a good person, and yet somehow I let myself be fooled by you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she spoke, tears rolled out out. It was at this time in a girl’s life when she was the weakest, and the most likely to weep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie let her cry, waiting for her calm down before sighing and saying, “Now I know why you’re sad. You’re sad because my death is not certain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHu Yue’er didn’t want to defend herself, but couldn’t help it. “You know full well that’s not what I meant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you knew I was going to die, wouldn’t you feel a little better?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you’re not going to die,” she replied immediately. “You already said that you would wait until you are sure you can succeed before making your move. If you know you can succeed, who could possibly stop you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I’m not going to die, and the assignment will be completed, and you’ll marry me in the end, then why are you so upset?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHu Yue’er seemed stumped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe suddenly realized that Liu Changjie’s laugh was repulsive—but not completely repulsively. It was a little bit cute as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him and sighed softly. “I know that you’re feeling pretty pleased with yourself right now. Because you know that I’m going to be much more obedient from now on, since we have no choice but to get married. But if you’re not obedient, then I’ll make you sleep on the ground instead of with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lips were next to his ears. “Now do you understand?” she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand. But,” he laughed, “there’s another thing I’m not clear about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed bitterly. “At this point I’m not sure if it’s me who fooled you, or you who fooled me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless of who fooled who, this kind of trickery would be welcomed by most people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe days passed happily. The only sad thing was how quickly the days went by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven days seemed to pass like the blink of an eye, and suddenly they had arrived at the last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the last night, and you would think it would be the sweetest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHu Yue’er was dressed up nicely, sitting in the living room. Normally, they would be laying in bed at this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie was looking at her. It seemed that he had been studying her for quite some while. Finally, he said, “Okay, what did I do to offend you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sick?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then what’s wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just don’t want to become a widow before I’m even married, that’s all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There is no one who wants you to be a widow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes there is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You.” Her face was blank as she continued coldly, “These seven days, any time I want to talk about serious issues, you just talk nonsense. If things continue on like this, I will definitely be a widow very soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie sighed. “Serious issues don’t need to be discussed with your mouth. You solve them with your hands.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And what are you planning to do to solve them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you’re acting like this tonight because you want to have a discussion?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If we don’t discuss it tonight, I’m afraid we won’t ever have another chance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie let out a sigh. “Alright.

In order to get that chance, you need to earn his trust. And to earn his trust, you have to do this important thing for him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have a better plan?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t.” She sighed. “These past few years, we know that a lot of crimes have been perpetrated by Dragon Fifth, but we haven’t been able to find a scrap of evidence.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even if you got your hands on some evidence, you might not be able to get your hands on him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, we needed to call in the cavalry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And your cavalry is me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Therefore, if you want to get your hands on him, you first need to get your hands on evidence of his crimes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Therefore, I definitely have to help him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you confident you can do it?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A little,” he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In one hour, you can kill the seven guards outside, then lift the 1,000 pound iron gate, open the three secret doors, and flee to a place where Madam Lovesickness can’t find you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I said that I’m a little bit confident, not that I’m completely confident.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know what kind of people those seven guards are?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you know about their martial arts?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t know anything, and you say you’re only a little bit confident.

Calling a person a fox in this way implies that they are crafty, thus I translated it as crafty. Also, I’m sure most people are familiar with fox spirits in Chinese mythology. In this case, he’s not calling her a literal fox spirit, he’s just saying that she is pretty, because fox spirits tend to be super hot. Another reason why this whole passage is funny, is because she makes a big deal about her father’s nickname “Power of Hu.” In Chinese it’s “hu li.” The word for fox is also “hu li” so it’s a cute play on words.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"footnote\" id\u003d\"footnote_5\"\u003e[5] \u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pudao\" rel\u003d\"noopener noreferrer\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"footnote\" id\u003d\"footnote_5\"\u003eHere is the type of sword\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"footnote\" id\u003d\"footnote_5\"\u003e that the driver is wielding.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"footnote\" id\u003d\"footnote_6\"\u003e[6] Qing Gong is the martial arts ability to make your body light, move very quickly, and also fly\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"footnote\" id\u003d\"footnote_7\"\u003e[7] The name of the poison in Chinese is 见血封喉.

Here is an excerpt from an article about it: Tongzigong, or Virgin Kung Fu, is one of the most spectacular forms of Shaolin kung fu, and yet it has no direct fighting applications. It is a fundamental building block of Shaolin practice, and yet it is too extreme for most practitioners to even begin to attempt. It is one of Shaolin\u0027s deepest meditation techniques, and yet it is the centerpiece act in almost every Shaolin theatrical show that toured the globe over the last two decades. To achieve its highest levels, tongzigong must be practiced rigorously before the body is fully matured. Once the bones are set, mastery of this discipline is unattainable. The body must be molded as it grows. Tongzi means child, boy or virgin. Gong means work. It\u0027s actually the same character as kung in kung fu (功夫), which literally means skill, art, labor or effort. To the untrained eye, tongzigong is a spectacle of contortionism, a real show-stopper on stage. But for Shaolin practitioners, tongzigong is far more than just a circus act. Within tongzigong lies an internal cultivation that is key to the very essence of all Shaolin kung fu.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"footnote\" id\u003d\"footnote_9\"\u003e[9] What I translated as “Thirteen Heroes Skill” is 十三太保横练, or literally Thirteen High Officials Cross-training?
