Nice way to close the conversation with a healthy dose of freak-us-out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon nodded at the other Luxen, and we headed out, Blake closing the door behind him. Only then did I realize the room was soundproof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well,” Blake said, smiling. “That wasn’t too bad, was it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes. “I have the feeling we just made a deal with the devil, and he’s going to come back and want our firstborn child or something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon waggled his brows. “You want kids? Because you know, practice makes—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up.” I shook my head and started walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hurried through the club, around the still-packed dance floor. I think all of us were ready to get out of there. As we neared the exit, I looked around Daemon and Blake, my eyes drifting over the dance floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of me wondered how many, if any, were hybrids. We were rare, but like I sensed at first, there was something different about this place. Something really different about the kid called Luc, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePro Wrestler greeted us at the door. He stepped aside, massive arms folded across his chest. “Remember,” he said. “You were never here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 16\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe got home late from Martinsburg, and I went straight to bed. Daemon followed, but all we did was curl up and sleep. Both of us were exhausted from everything, and it was nice with him there, a steady presence that relaxed and soothed my frazzled nerves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was a zombie on Thursday, and Blake’s disgustingly chipper attitude in bio made me want to hurl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should be happier,” he whispered as I hastily scribbled down notes. No doubt I’d failed the exam yesterday. “After Sunday, everything will be over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything will be over. My pen stopped. A muscle in my neck tensed. “It won’t be easy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, it will be. You just need faith.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost laughed. Faith in who? Blake? Or the mafia kid? I didn’t trust either of them. “After Sunday, you’ll be gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like the last decade,” he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter class, I packed up my stuff, smiled at something Lesa said, and then waited for Dawson. I didn’t like to leave him alone with Blake. Not when Dawson was eyeballing the dude like he wanted to pummel information out of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake brushed past us, grinning as he switched his books to his other hand. He swaggered on down the hall, waving at a group of kids that called out his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t like him,” Dawson grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get in line.” We headed down the hall. “But we need him until Sunday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawson stared ahead. “Still don’t like him.” And then he asked, “He had a thing for you, didn’t he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cheeks burned. “What makes you think that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small smile appeared. “My brother’s hate for him knows no bounds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, he did kill Adam,” I said in a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I know, but it’s personal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. “How is it more personal than that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is.” Dawson pushed open the door, and we were attacked by the giggle squad on the landing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKimmy was captain. “Wow. Why aren’t I surprised?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found myself moving in front of Dawson. “And why do I have no clue what you’re talking about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind me, Dawson shifted his weight from one foot to the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, it’s pretty obvious.” She leaned against the rail, her backpack resting on the top. Around her, the girls tittered. “One brother isn’t enough for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could react, Dawson stepped around me and spat, “You’re sad and revolting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKimmy’s smile froze, and maybe the old Dawson would’ve never said anything like that, because she and all her friends looked like someone just walked over their graves. Somewhere, in the back of my mind, I wanted to laugh, but I was so angry—so repulsed by the suggestion I’d be seeing two twin brothers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI honestly don’t know what happened next. A pulse of energy left me, and the pretty pink backpack shook and then tipped over the railing. The weight jerked Kimmy. Her heeled shoes came off the floor, and in a flash I saw what was going to happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was going to go right over the railing, headfirst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA scream started in my throat and came out of Kimmy. Her friends’ horrified looks were permanently etched in my memory, and my heartbeat skyrocketed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawson shot forward, catching one of her flailing arms. He had her on her feet before her scream had faded from my ears. “I got you,” he said, surprisingly gentle. Kimmy gulped in air, clutching Dawson’s hand. “It’s okay. You’re okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe carefully pried her fingers off his and stepped back. Her friends immediately surrounded her. Then he turned to me, his eyes clouded. Cupping my elbow, he quickly steered me down the stairwell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as we were out of hearing distance, he stopped and faced me. “What was that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy breath caught and I looked away, confused and full of shame. Everything had happened so fast, and I’d been so furious. But it had been me—a part of me that had acted without thought or knowledge. A part of me that had known the weight of her bag would’ve toppled her right over the edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt lunch, I didn’t tell Daemon about what happened with Kimmy in the stairwell, convincing myself that since Carissa and Lesa were with us, it was so not the conversation to have. It was nothing more than an excuse, but I felt as revolting as Kimmy’s words. Later that day, when we were at Daemon’s house, going over plans for Sunday with the crew, I told myself it still wasn’t the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEspecially when Dee was demanding to go and Daemon was having none of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need you and Ash to hang back, along with Matthew, just in case something goes wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee folded her arms. “What, you don’t think I can handle myself with you guys? That I might trip and stab Blake to death?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brother shot her a bland look. “Well, now that you say it…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled her eyes. “Is Katy going in with you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy shoulders slumped. Here we go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon’s body tensed. “I don’t want—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” I cut him off with a deadly look. “Only because I got most of us into this mess, and Blake won’t do any of this without Daemon and me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh smirked from the settee. Other than staring at Daemon like she wanted to rekindle their romance, she wasn’t doing or saying much. “How valiant of you, Katy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored her. “But we do need people on the outside in case something goes wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Andrew asked. “You don’t trust Blake? Go figure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon sat back, running both his hands through his hair. “Anyway, we’ll be in and out. Then everything…everything will be over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brother blinked slowly, and I knew he was thinking about Beth. Maybe even picturing her, and I wondered how long it had been since he last saw her. So I asked and surprisingly, he answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. Time there was different. Weeks? Months?” He stood, shoulders rolling. “I don’t think I was at that Mount place. The place was always warm and dry whenever I was taken outside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaken outside, like a pet or something. Wrong on so many levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawson let out a ragged breath. “I need to walk or move.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around quickly. The sun had set a while ago. Not like he needed it, though. He was already out the door before anyone could say a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll go.” It was Dee this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrew stood. “I’ll follow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess I’m out of here.” This from Ash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew sighed. “One of these days, we will get through everything without any drama.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon laughed tiredly. “Good luck with that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn about five minutes, everyone except Daemon was cleared out of the house. Perfect time to ’fess up to almost breaking Kimmy’s neck, except there was a glint in Daemon’s jade-colored eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth dried. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon stood and stretched, flashing a slice of taut skin. “It’s quiet.” He offered his hand and I took it in mine. “It’s never quiet around here. Not anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did have a point. I let him tug me to my feet. “It’s not going to last long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope.” He pulled me to him and a second later, I was in his arms and we were zooming up the stairs. He placed me on my feet in his bedroom. “Admit it. You like my method of travel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling a little dizzy, I laughed. “One of these days I’m going to be faster than you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Keep dreaming.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tool,” I threw back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon’s lips curved up on one side. “Trouble.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” I widened my eyes. “Harsh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We should make use of this quiet time.” He advanced toward me, like a predator with its prey in its sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?” Suddenly feeling way too hot, I backed up until I hit his bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really.” He kicked off his shoes. “I say we have about thirty minutes before someone interrupts us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze dropped as he pulled off his shirt and tossed it. I sucked in a sharp breath. “Probably not that long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips formed a wicked smile. “True. So let’s say we have twenty minutes, give or take five.” He stopped in front of me, his eyes hooded. “Not nearly enough time for what I’d like to do, but we can work around that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeat swept through my veins, and I felt dizzy again. “We can?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mmm-hmm.” He placed his hands on my shoulders and pressed down until I was sitting on the very edge of the bed. Running his hands to my cheeks, he knelt between my boneless legs so that we were eye level with each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon’s lashes lowered, fanning his cheeks. “I’ve missed you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrapped my fingers around his wrists. “You’ve seen me every day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not enough,” he murmured and pressed his lips where my pulse pounded along my neck. “And we’re always with someone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, wasn’t that the truth. Last time we were alone for any considerable amount of time, we’d both slept. So these moments were precious, brief, and stolen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled as he trailed a line of kisses up my chin, stopping short of my lips. “We probably shouldn’t spend it talking, then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh-huh.” He kissed a corner of my lips. “Talking is such a time waster.” And then he kissed the other corner. “And when we talk, we usually end up arguing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. “Not always.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon pulled back, brows raised. “Kitten…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay.” I scooted back and he followed, climbing over me, his arms huge and powerful. God, I was in way over my head with him sometimes. “You might be right, but you’re wasting time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m always right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth to disagree, but his lips took control of mine, and his kiss reached deep down inside me, melted muscle and bone. His tongue swept over mine, and at that moment, he could have been right all he wanted as long as he kept kissing me like that. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/opal-lux-3/page-22.html","bookId":1663,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:38 PM"}
