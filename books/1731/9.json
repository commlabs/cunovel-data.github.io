Gower was considered by his contemporaries, though not by moderns, to have been almost Chaucer\u0027s equal, and though it might be thought they would have borne each other the ill will of competitors, they did not. They dedicated books to each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of Gower\u0027s principal works is Confessio Amantis (Confession of a Lover), first published in 1383. In this work, a number of romances are told in English couplets. The tales are by no means original with Gower. What he does is retell stories from ancient and medieval sources, choosing the most popular ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the eighth book of Confessio Amantis Gower tells a tale, taken from a Greek source, of which a version is presented in this play. A prose version of the same story, \"The Pattern of Painful Adventures,\" was published in 1576 by Laurence Twine. Some scenes in Pericles are drawn from Twine, but Gower is the major influence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is only in this play and in The Two Noble Kinsmen (see page I-54) that Shakespeare so openly announces his source.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... Antiochus the great\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGower lays the scene of the play:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis Antioch, then; Antiochus the great\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilt up this city for his chiefest seat,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fairest in all Syria-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act I, Introduction, lines 17-19\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis alone tells us that the time in which the tale is supposed to take place is in the Hellenistic period; that is, in the couple of centuries that followed the death of Alexander the Great. In this period, Greek-language monarchies were established in Egypt and western Asia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe largest of these was established south and east of Asia Minor in 321 b.c. by Seleucus I, who had been one of Alexander\u0027s generals. The realm is, in his honor, usually called the Seleucid Empire in the histories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeleucus had made his first capital in ancient Babylon, but quickly abandoned it as too alien and un-Greek. In its place, he constructed Seleucia on the Tigris, about twenty miles north of Babylon. It became a thoroughly Greek city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the Empire covered vast tracts of what are now the nations of Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan, the portion most under the influence of Greek culture and therefore most valued by the Greek-speaking and Greek-cultured descendants of Seleucus was the westernmost part, commonly called Syria by the Greeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Syria Seleucus founded a city which served as his western capital and named it Antiocheia, after his father, Antiochus. In English, we know it as Antioch. It was located fifteen miles from the sea, near the northeastern corner of the Mediterranean, and is now located in southwestern Turkey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout a century and three quarters after the founding of the Seleucid Empire, almost all the eastern provinces had fallen away and come under the rule of native princes. What was left of the Greek kingdom was concentrated in the westernmost provinces and what had been the Seleucid Empire came more and more to be called simply Syria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the vicissitudes of the Empire, however, Antioch continued to grow and became a great metropolis. In the days of the Roman Empire, when Rome had finally absorbed the last remnant of the Seleucid realm, Antioch was the third largest city of the Empire. Only Rome itself and Alexandria in Egypt were larger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question is, now, which monarch is referred to by Gower as \"Antiochus the great\"? It is no use to try to decide by the actual events of the play, since these are all fictitious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were thirteen monarchs of the Seleucid kingdom named Antiochus, but one of them, the third of the name, did call himself Antiochus the Great. This Antiochus III ruled from 223 to 187 b.c. In the first part of his reign, he brought back into the Seleucid fold (very temporarily) some of the large eastern provinces that were breaking away, marching through the east almost like another Alexander in doing so. It was this which gave him the idea of calling himself \"the Great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce that was accomplished, he attempted to annex Egypt, which was governed by a boy king at the time, and also Asia Minor. Had he succeeded, he would have united almost all of Alexander\u0027s Empire under his rule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately for himself, Antiochus HI fell afoul of the rising power of Rome. Challenging that Western nation, he invaded Greece, but was defeated there in 191 b.c. The Romans followed him into Asia Minor and defeated him again in 190 B.C. Antiochus ended his reign in defeat and failure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering that in Pericles Antiochus the Great is pictured as ruling in magnificence and glory (at least at the beginning), we might arbitrarily place the fictitious events of this play about 200 b.c. This is twenty years after the suggested time of A Comedy of Errors and so Pericles becomes the eighth and last of Shakespeare\u0027s Greek plays.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... her to incest...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGower goes on to explain that \"Antiochus the great\" was left a widower with a beautiful daughter:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith whom the father liking took,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd her to incest did provoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act I, Introduction, lines 25-26\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncest is treated here as a horrible and unspeakable crime, and so it is considered in most societies; though, it must be admitted, not in all. The Egyptian Pharaohs routinely married their sisters, feeling perhaps that only their sisters had blood aristocratic enough to make a marriage suitable. (Or perhaps it was a relic of matrilineal descent; of the times when the nature of fatherhood was not understood and when property could only be inherited through the mother. By marrying his sister, the Pharaoh could make sure that the sister\u0027s son, who later was to inherit the throne, would also be his own.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the death of Alexander the Great, one of his generals, Ptolemy, seized Egypt and established the \"Ptolemaic kingdom.\" For nearly three centuries Egypt was ruled by his descendants, all of whom were named Ptolemy. The Ptolemies carefully adhered to Egyptian customs in order to remain popular with their subjects. Ptolemy II took for his second wife, for instance, his full sister, Arsinoe. As a result, first she, and then he, received the surname Philadelphus (\"sibling lover\"). He did not have children by her. Cleopatra, the last of the Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt (see page I-318), was married in turn to two of her brothers, though each marriage was purely formal, for both were children at the time of the marriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, in the Persian dominions in the days before Alexander\u0027s conquest, nicest was not abhorred and father-daughter unions were allowed. Antiochus the Great ruled over most of the core of the old Persian Empire. It is not on record that he followed Persian custom in this respect, but that old custom may have been in the mind of the anonymous Greek writer who first invented the tale which worked its way down the centuries and came to rest in Shakespeare\u0027s Pericles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... Prince of Tyre. ..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo keep his luscious daughter from the princely suitors that sought her hand, Antiochus forced all to attempt to solve a riddle. Failure to solve the riddle was punished with death and numerous suitors had already suffered that penalty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe play itself begins before the palace at Antioch, where a young suitor has come to present himself for the hand of the princess. Antiochus says:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYoung Prince of Tyre, you have at large received\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe danger of the task you undertake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act I, scene i, lines 1-2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyre is a city on the Mediterranean coast, about 220 miles south of Antioch. It is much the more ancient of the two cities, for it was a flourishing town in the thirteenth century b.c. when the ancient Egyptian Empire was at its height.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyre was an important port of the Canaanites, who were called Phoenicians by the Greeks. Its ships ventured far through the Mediterranean, founding what eventually became the still greater city of Carthage on the north African shore. Tyrian ships even ventured outside the Mediterranean, reaching Britain on the north and, as one tale has it, circumnavigating the African continent to the south.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyre\u0027s stronghold was on a rocky island off the shore and this, combined with her navy, kept her secure against the land-based empires of Asia. She maintained her independence not only against David\u0027s Israelite Empire but against the much more dangerous Assyrian and Chaldean empires. Nebuchadrezzar subjected it to a thirteen-year siege from 587 to 574 b.c. and managed only a partial victory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe real end of Tyre\u0027s independence came in 332 b.c., when one much greater than Nebuchadrezzar banged against its gates. This was Alexander the Great himself. He had been sweeping through Asia Minor with scarcely any resistance and was now heading toward Egypt, when Tyre unexpectedly refused to yield. Even Alexander required seven full months to take Tyre, and when he completed the job, he was vengeful enough to have ten thousand of its citizens executed and another thirty thousand sold into slavery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Tyre recovered to some extent, it remained only a shadow of its former self, first under the Ptolemies of Egypt, then under the Seleucid Empire, and finally under the Roman Empire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was in 198 b.c., just about the suggested time of the events of this play, that Antiochus the Great wrested the southern part of Syria from Egypt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyre vanished from the view of western Europe after the breakup of the Roman Empire, but reappeared in the time of the Crusades. The Crusaders captured it in 1124 and for over a century it remained one of the chief cities of the Christian \"Kingdom of Jerusalem.\" When the Crusaders were finally driven out of the East, Tyre was destroyed. A small village, still bearing the old name, exists on its site now, in southern Lebanon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe original Greek version of the story of Pericles is lost, but a Latin prose romance based on that Greek version exists. It begins with the incest and riddle of Antiochus, and the young man who comes to win the princess is \"Apollonius of Tyre.\" The \"of Tyre\" merely means he was born there, or lives there. To make him Prince of Tyre is an anachronism, for Tyre did not have independent rulers in Hellenistic times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShakespeare did not use the name Apollonius. He was influenced, apparently, by a character in Arcadia, a romance written in 1580 by Sir Philip Sidney, which had as one of its heroes a character named Pyrocles. Pyrocles\u0027 nobility was something like that which Shakespeare had in mind for his own hero, and, perhaps for that reason, he used the name, converting it to the more common Greek form of Pericles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only important historical Pericles was the leader of democratic Athens from 460 to 429 b.c. Under him, Athens was at the height of its power and culture and his rule may be taken as coinciding with the Golden Age of Greece. It must be emphasized, though, that the Pericles of Shakespeare\u0027s play has nothing whatever to do with Pericles of Golden Age Athens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... this fair Hesperides\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePericles declares himself aware of the danger of wooing Antiochus\u0027 daughter, and she is brought out before him-a vision of loveliness. Antiochus says:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore thee stands this fair Hesperides,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith golden fruit, but dangerous to be touched;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor deathlike dragons here affright thee hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act I, scene i, lines 28-30\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a reference to the eleventh of the twelve labors which Hercules was supposed to undergo in the Greek myths. The Hesperides are so named from a Greek word meaning \"west.\" They were the three daughters of Hesperus, the Evening Star (which always appears in the west after sunset), according to one version of the myth. Another version has them the daughters of the Titan Atlas, who gave his name to the Atlantic Ocean and who was associated with what was, to the Greeks, the Far West.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the far western section of the north African coast there was supposed to be a garden containing a tree bearing golden apples (oranges, I wonder?), which was guarded by an ever watchful dragon. Hercules achieved this task, as he did all others, but Antiochus seems to doubt that Pericles can do the equivalent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... to Tharsus\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAntiochus presents the riddle Pericles must solve. It is a silly riddle and quite transparent. Pericles sees the answer at once and is horrified. He carefully hints at the truth and Antiochus is, in his turn, horrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePericles sees that to have solved the riddle is as dangerous as to have missed it and leaves hurriedly for Tyre. Antiochus sends a servant after the young prince to poison him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven at Tyre, Pericles is uneasy. He is not far enough from Antioch and he feels that Antiochus will come against him with an army and bring misery on the whole city. (And well he might, for in actual history, Tyre became part of Antiochus\u0027 dominions in 198 b.c.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePericles tells his loyal lord, Helicanus, the story and says he intends to go into exile:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyre, I now look from thee then, and to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTharsus Intend my travel...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act I, scene ii, lines 115-16\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo city named Tharsus is to be found in the gazetteers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe name is very similar to Tarsus, an important city on the southern coast of Asia Minor, best known to us as the place where Antony and Cleopatra first met (see page I-343) a century and a half after the time of Pericles, and where St. Paul was born a few decades later still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTarsus, however, is only about 170 miles west of Antioch and was as firmly in the Seleucid grip as was Tyre itself. It is interesting to wonder if perhaps Tharsus is a distortion of Thasos, a small island in the northern Aegean Sea. There are places in the play where Thasos would fit well.- However, it is most likely that Tharsus is a completely fictitious place, no more to be located on the map than the Bohemia of The Winter\u0027s Tale (see page I-156).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... the Trojan horse ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePericles leaves Tyre just in time to escape Antiochus\u0027 poisoning emissary, but he finds matters in Tharsus not well. Its governor, Cleon, and his wife, Dionyza, bewail the fact that the prosperous city has been reduced by a two-year famine to a point of near cannibalism. Even as they are wailing, a fleet of ships appears on the horizon. At first they suspect it is an enemy come to take advantage of their weakness, but it is the noble Pericles. He enters with his attendants and says:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... these our ships you happily [i.e., perhaps] may think\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre like the Trojan horse [which] was stuffed within\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith bloody veins expecting overthrow,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre stored with corn to make your needy bread,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act I, scene iv, lines 91-94\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Trojan horse was the final stratagem of the Greeks, who after ten years\u0027 siege of Troy (see page I-89) had abandoned hope of conquest by direct attack. The climactic scene of the war is not described in Homer\u0027s Iliad or in Shakespeare\u0027s Troilus and Cressida. It is, however, described in Vergil\u0027s Aeneid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Greeks built a giant hollow horse, filled it with their best warriors, then pretended to abandon the siege and sail away. The Trojans were easily convinced that the horse was an offering to Minerva (Athena) and that it was a good luck token which, if accepted, would forever protect the city against conquest. It was accordingly taken into the city and that night the Greek warriors emerged and opened the gates to the remainder of the army (which had secretly returned). Then began the bloody task of sacking the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePericles\u0027 ships, however, were not filled with warriors, but with food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... our country of Greece...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGower emerges at the beginning of the Second Act to explain that Pericles is treated with great honor at Tharsus but that word comes to him from Tyre that Antiochus is indeed anxious to have him killed and that even Tharsus will not be safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePericles therefore takes to the sea again and this time is wrecked. He is washed on shore all alone, all his companions and goods gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Second Act opens, then, on the shore of the Pentapolis, which apparently is where Pericles has been washed up. He approaches some fishermen, asking their help for pity, pointing out that he has never had to beg before. The First Fisherman replies sardonically:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, friend, cannot you beg?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0027s them in our country of Greece\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egets more with begging than we can do with working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Act II, scene i, lines 67-69\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pentapolis (\"five cities\") is a district on the north African shore about 550 miles west of Alexandria and 950 miles southwest of Antioch. The chief of the five cities was Cyrene, and the region is still called Cy-renaica today. It is the northeasternmost section of the modern nation of Libya and was much in the news in 1941 and 1942, when the British and Germans were fighting back and forth across it in the Desert War.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObviously, the Pentapolis is not in Greece in the modern sense, where that is specifically the land occupying the southernmost portion of the Balkan peninsula. Yet Shakespeare, or whoever wrote this scene, was (perhaps unknowingly) not really incorrect in the wider sense of Greece as including any area where Greek language and culture was dominant (see page I-172).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knight of Sparta. ..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ruler of Pentapolis is Simonides, and his daughter, Thaisa, is having a birthday the next day.

It suffered also from barbarian invasions in the third century b.c. Nevertheless, Macedon managed to maintain control over the entire Balkan peninsula, including Greece proper.

An early version of this temple was completed about 420 b.c. and was impressive enough to be considered one of the Seven Wonders of the World.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn October 356 b.c. the temple was destroyed by fire and it proved to be a case of deliberate arson. When the culprit was captured, he was asked why he had done this deed. He replied that he did it in order that his name might live forever in history. He was executed and to defeat his desire it was ordered that his name be erased from all records and never be spoken. (However, the man had his wish after all, for a name purporting to be his survives somehow. It is Herostratus.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a century and a half before the time of Pericles, but the temple was rebuilt, of course. Indeed, it is most famous to moderns because it plays a distant role in the New Testament, some two centuries after the time of Pericles and four centuries after Herostratus\u0027 crime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSt. Paul, in Ephesus on a missionary voyage, denounced idolatry and roused the hostility of the silversmiths of the city, who did a roaring business in the manufacture of little religious objects for tourists who came to visit the temple of Diana. Not foreseeing the time when their successors would do equally well, if not better, with small crucifixes and statues of the Virgin Mary, the silversmiths were horrified at St. Paul\u0027s denunciation of idolatry. There were riots in the city and the crowd was \"full of wrath and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians\" (Acts of the Apostles 19:28).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be sure, Shakespeare knew Diana as the virgin goddess of the moon and the hunt (see page I-14), as she was in classical Greek mythology. The Diana of the Ephesians was another goddess altogether, a representation of fecundity, a fertility goddess with her chest covered by breasts, representing, perhaps, the nourishing earth. Diana\u0027s temple in Ephesus was surely not an appropriate life for a quiet existence, free from the sexual lusts of the world, but in the play it is taken as such.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... dove of Paphos. ..\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fourth act once again opens with Gower, who covers this time a passage of fourteen years, during which Marina grows to young womanhood in Tharsus.

As he was dying, he cried out to cranes passing overhead, urging them to tell the world of the crime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Corinthian populace was stunned and horrified at the death of the popular poet and the thieves were uneasy at the stir they had created. During the course of a play which they were watching along with the rest of the Corinthians, the Furies (spirits who avenge crimes) were presented in such horrid fashion that the thieves were terrified. And when, just at this moment, cranes happened to fly overhead, the distraught thieves cried, \"The cranes of Ibycus! The cranes of Ibycus!\" and gave themselves away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother possible source for the superstition rests in a verse in the Bible which says: \"Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter\" (Ecclesiastes 10:20). This can be interpreted as a warning that Icings and powerful men have spies and sycophants in plenty who are always ready to earn gratitude by accusing others of treasons.

It set him to thinking of the importance of numbers in the universe and he and his disciples evolved many odd beliefs based on numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pythagoreans later developed the notion of the individual planets being set in spheres (see page I-25) at distances relative to each other such that they could emit harmonious notes. Perhaps at first this \"music of the spheres\" was considered metaphorically only, but eventually it was taken literally and came to mean a celestial sound that was far more beautiful than could be imagined on earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePericles was finally being rewarded for having endured so much misfortune so patiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... goddess argentine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the sound of the music, Pericles falls asleep and in his sleep the goddess Diana appears to him.

The Latin word for silver is argentum, so that Diana as the silver goddess of the moon is the \"goddess argentine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nation of Argentina was so named because the earliest explorers found the natives wearing silver ornaments. The river which they were exploring became the Rio de la Plata (Spanish for \"Silver River\"). The nation that grew up about that river as a nucleus became the Latinized version of the same idea, Argentina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result, the term \"goddess argentine\" would nowadays be rather ambiguous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Ephesus Pericles discovers his wife Thaisa and so, after fourteen years, the family is reunited.
