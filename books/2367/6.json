{"id":69074,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\u003cp\u003eOliver\u0027s days were full, and he loved every minute of what he was doing. There were political appointments to be made, legislation to be put forward, appropriations to be approved, meetings and speeches and press interviews. The State Journal in Frankfort, the Herald-Leader in Lexington, and the Louisville Courier-Journal gave him glowing reports. He was earning the reputation of being a governor who got things done. Oliver was swept up in the social life of the superwealthy, and he knew that a large part of that was because he was married to the daughter of Senator Todd Davis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver enjoyed living in Frankfort. It was a lovely, historic city nestled in a scenic river valley among the rolling hills of Kentucky\u0027s fabled bluegrass region. He wondered what it would be like to live in Washington, D.C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe busy days merged into weeks, and the weeks merged into months. Oliver began the last year of his term.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver had made Peter Tager his press secretary. He was the perfect choice. Tager was always forth-right with the press, and because of the decent, old-fashioned values he stood for and liked to talk about, he gave the party substance and dignity. Peter Tager and his black eye patch became almost as well recognized as Oliver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTodd Davis made it a point to fly down to Frankfort to see Oliver at least once a month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said to Peter Tager, \"When you\u0027ve got a Thoroughbred running, you have to keep an eye on him to make sure he doesn\u0027t lose his timing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a chilly evening in October, Oliver and Senator Davis were seated in Oliver\u0027s study. The two men and Jan had gone out to dinner at Gabriel\u0027s and had returned to the Executive Mansion. Jan had left the men to talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jan seems very happy, Oliver. I\u0027m pleased.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I try to make her happy, Todd.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSenator Davis looked at Oliver and wondered how often he used the apartment. \"She loves you a lot, son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I love her.\" Oliver sounded very sincere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSenator Davis smiled. \"I\u0027m glad to hear that. She\u0027s already redecorating the White House.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver\u0027s heart skipped a beat. \"I beg your pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, didn\u0027t I tell you? It\u0027s begun. Your name\u0027s becoming a byword in Washington. We\u0027re going to begin our campaign the first of the year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver was almost afraid to ask the next question. \"Do you honestly think I have a chance, Todd?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The word \u0027chance\u0027 implies a gamble, and I don\u0027t gamble, son. I won\u0027t get involved in anything unless I know it\u0027s a sure thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver took a deep breath. \"You can be the most important man in the world.\" \"I want you to know how very much I appreciate everything you\u0027ve done for me, Todd.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTodd patted Oliver\u0027s arm. \"It\u0027s a man\u0027s duty to help his son-in-law, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe emphasis on \"son-in-law\" was not lost on Oliver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe senator said casually, \"By the way, Oliver, I was very disappointed that your legislature passed that tobacco tax bill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That money will take care of the shortfall in our fiscal budget, and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But of course you\u0027re going to veto it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver stared at him. \"Veto it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe senator gave him a small smile. \"Oliver, I want you to know that I\u0027m not thinking about myself. But I have a lot of friends who invested their hard-earned money in tobacco plantations, and I wouldn\u0027t want to see them get hurt by oppressive new taxes, would you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you, Oliver?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Oliver finally said. \"I guess it wouldn\u0027t be fair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate that. I really do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver said, \"I had heard that you\u0027d sold your tobacco plantations, Todd.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTodd Davis looked at him, surprised. \"Why would I want to do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, the tobacco companies are taking a beating in the courts. Sales are way down, and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re talking about the United States, son. There\u0027s a great big world out there. Wait until our advertising campaigns start rolling in China and Africa and India.\" He looked at his watch and rose. \"I have to head back to Washington. I have a committee meeting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have a good flight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSenator Davis smiled. \"Now I will, son. Now I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver was upset. \"What the hell am I going to do, Peter? The tobacco tax is by far the most popular measure the legislature has passed this year. What excuse do I have for vetoing it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter Tager took several sheets of paper from his pocket. \"All the answers are right here, Oliver. I\u0027ve discussed it with the senator. You won\u0027t have any problem. I\u0027ve set up a press conference for four o\u0027clock.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver studied the papers. Finally, he nodded. \"This is good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s what I do. Is there anything else you need me for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Thank you. I\u0027ll see you at four.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeter Tager started to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTager turned. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me something. Do you think I really have a chance of becoming president?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does the senator say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He says I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTager walked back to the desk. \"I\u0027ve known Senator Davis for many years, Oliver. In all that time, he hasn\u0027t been wrong once. Not once. The man has incredible instincts. If Todd Davis says you\u0027re going to be the next President of the United States, you can bet the farm on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a knock at the door. \"Come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened, and an attractive young secretary walked in, carrying some faxes. She was in her early twenties, bright and eager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, excuse me, Governor. I didn\u0027t know you were in a - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all right, Miriam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTager smiled. \"Hi, Miriam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Mr. Tager.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver said, \"I don\u0027t know what I\u0027d do without Miriam. She does everything for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiriam blushed. \"If there\u0027s nothing else - \" She put the faxes on Oliver\u0027s desk and turned and hurried out of the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a pretty woman,\" Tager said. He looked over at Oliver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oliver, you are being careful, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I am. That\u0027s why I had you get that little apartment for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean big-time careful. The stakes have gone up. The next time you get horny, just stop and think about whether a Miriam or Alice or Karen is worth the Oval Office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know what you\u0027re saying, Peter, and I appreciate it. But you don\u0027t have to worry about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" Tager looked at his watch. \"I have to go. I\u0027m taking Betsy and the kids out to lunch.\" He smiled. \"Did I tell you what Rebecca did this morning? She\u0027s my five-year-old. There was a tape of a kid\u0027s show she wanted to watch at eight o\u0027clock this morning. Betsy said, \u0027Darling, I\u0027ll run it for you after lunch.\u0027 Rebecca looked at her and said, \u0027Mama, I want lunch now.\u0027 Pretty smart, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver had to smile at the pride in Tager\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt ten o\u0027clock that evening, Oliver walked into the den where Jan was reading and said, \"Honey, I have to leave. I have a conference to go to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJan looked up. \"At this time of night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. \"I\u0027m afraid so. There\u0027s a budget committee meeting in the morning, and they want to brief me before the meeting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re working too hard. Try to come home early, will you, Oliver?\" She hesitated a moment. \"You\u0027ve been out a lot lately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wondered whether that was intended as a warning. He walked over to her, leaned down, and kissed her. \"Don\u0027t worry, honey. I\u0027ll be home as early as I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDownstairs Oliver said to his chauffeur, \"I won\u0027t need you tonight. I\u0027m taking the small car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Governor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re late, darling.\" Miriam was naked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned and walked over to her. \"Sorry about that. I\u0027m glad you didn\u0027t start without me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"Hold me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her in his arms and held her close, her warm body pressed against his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get undressed. Hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfterward, he said, \"How would you like to move to Washington, D.C.?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiriam sat up in bed. \"Are you serious?\" \"Very. I may be going there. I want you to be with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If your wife ever found out about us...\" \"She won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why Washington?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t tell you that now. All I can say is that it\u0027s going to be very exciting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go anywhere you want me to go, as long as you love me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I love you.\" The words slipped out easily, as they had so many times in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make love to me again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a second. I have something for you.\" He got up and walked over to the jacket he had flung over a chair. He took a small bottle out of his pocket and poured the contents into a glass. It was a clear liquid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Miriam asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll like it. I promise.\" He lifted the glass and drank half of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiriam took a sip, then swallowed the rest of it. She smiled. \"It\u0027s not bad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s going to make you feel real sexy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already feel real sexy. Come back to bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were making love again when she gasped and said, \"I - I\u0027m not feeling well.\" She began to pant. \"I can\u0027t breathe.\" Her eyes were closing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miriam!\" There was no response. She fell back on the bed. \"Miriam!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lay there, unconscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSon of a bitch! Why are you doing this to me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got up and began to pace. He had given the liquid to a dozen women, and only once had it harmed anyone. He had to be careful. Unless he handled this right, it was going to be the end of everything. All his dreams, everything he had worked for. He could not let that happen. He stood at the side of the bed, looking down at her. He felt her pulse. She was still breathing, thank God. But he could not let her be discovered in this apartment. It would be traced back to him. He had to leave her somewhere where she would be found and be given medical help. He could trust her not to reveal his name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took him almost half an hour to get her dressed and to remove all traces of her from his apartment. He opened the door a crack to make sure that the hallway was empty, then picked her up, put her over his shoulder, and carried her downstairs and put her in the car. It was almost midnight, and the streets were deserted. It was beginning to rain. He drove to Juniper Hill Park, and when he was sure that no one was in sight, he lifted Miriam out of the car and gently laid her down on a park bench. He hated to leave her there, but he had no choice. None. His whole future was at stake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a public phone booth a few feet away. He hurried over to it and dialed 911.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJan was waiting up for Oliver when he returned home. \"It\u0027s after midnight,\" she said. \"What took you - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, darling. We got into a long, boring discussion on the budget, and - well, everyone had a different opinion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look pale,\" Jan said. \"You must be exhausted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am a little tired,\" he admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled suggestively. \"Let\u0027s go to bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her on the forehead. \"I\u0027ve really got to get some sleep, Jan. That meeting knocked me out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story was on the front page of the State Journal the following morning:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGOVERNOR\u0027S SECRETARY FOUND UNCONSCIOUS IN PARK.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt two o\u0027clock this morning, police found the unconscious woman, Miriam Friedland, lying on the bench in the rain and immediately called for an ambulance. She was taken to Memorial Hospital, where her condition is said to be critical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Oliver was reading the story, Peter came hurrying into his office, carrying a copy of the newspaper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you seen this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It\u0027s - it\u0027s terrible. The press has been calling all morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you suppose happened?\" Tager asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver shook his head. \"I don\u0027t know. I just talked to the hospital. She\u0027s in a coma. They\u0027re trying to learn what caused it. The hospital is going to let me know as soon as they find out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTager looked at Oliver. \"I hope she\u0027s going to be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeslie Chambers missed seeing the newspaper stories. She was in Brazil, buying a television station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe telephone call from the hospital came the following day. \"Governor, we\u0027ve just finished the laboratory tests. She\u0027s ingested a substance called methylenedioxymethamphetamine, commonly known as Ecstasy. She took it in liquid form, which is even more lethal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s her condition?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s critical. She\u0027s in a coma. She could wake up or - \" He hesitated. \"It could go the other way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please keep me informed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. You must be very concerned, Governor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver Russell was in a conference when a secretary buzzed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me, Governor. There\u0027s a telephone call for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you no interruptions, Heather.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Senator Davis on line three.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver turned to the men in the room. \"We\u0027ll finish this later, gentlemen. If you\u0027ll excuse me...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched them leave the room, and when the door closed behind them, he picked up the telephone. \"Todd?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oliver, what\u0027s this about a secretary of yours found drugged on a park bench?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Oliver said. \"It\u0027s a terrible thing, Todd. I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How terrible?\" Senator Davis demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know damn well what I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Todd, you don\u0027t think I - I swear I don\u0027t know anything about what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope not.\" The senator\u0027s voice was grim. \"You know how fast gossip gets around in Washington, Oliver. It\u0027s the smallest town in America. We don\u0027t want anything negative linked to you. We\u0027re getting ready to make our move. I\u0027d be very, very upset if you did anything stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I promise you, I\u0027m clean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just make sure you keep it that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I will. I - \" The line went dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver sat there thinking. I\u0027ll have to be more careful. I can\u0027t let anything stop me now. He glanced at his watch, then reached for the remote control that turned on the television set. The news was on. On the screen was a picture of a besieged street, with snipers shooting at random from buildings. The sound of mortar fire could be heard in the background.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn attractive young female reporter, dressed in battle fatigues and holding a microphone, was saying, \"The new treaty is supposed to take effect at midnight tonight, but regardless of whether it holds, it can never bring back the peaceful villages in this war-torn country or restore the lives of the innocents who have been swept up in the ruthless reign of terror.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scene shifted to a close-up of Dana Evans, a passionate, lovely young woman in a flak jacket and combat boots. \"The people here are hungry and tired. They ask for only one thing - peace. Will it come? Only time will tell. This is Dana Evans reporting from Sarajevo for WTE, Washington Tribune Enterprises.\" The scene dissolved into a commercial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana Evans was a foreign correspondent for the Washington Tribune Enterprises Broadcasting System.
