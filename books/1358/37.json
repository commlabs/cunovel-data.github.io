{"id":26586,"no":37,"title":"Chapter 37.","content":"Two days after, Mrs. Methven arrived at Kinloch Houran by the afternoon coach, alone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She had interpreted very literally the telegram which had brought such a tremor yet such a movement of joy to her heart. Her son wanted her. Perhaps he might be ill, certainly it must be for something serious and painful that she was called; yet he wanted her! She had been very quiet and patient, waiting if perhaps his heart might be touched and he might recall the tie of nature and his own promises, feeling with a sad pride that she wanted nothing of him but his love, and that without that the fine houses and the new wealth were nothing to her. She was pleased even to stand aloof, to be conscious of having in no way profited by Walter’s advancement. She had gained nothing by it, she wished to gain nothing by it. If Walter were well, then there was no need for more. She had enough for herself without troubling him. So long as all was well! But this is at the best a forlorn line of argument, and it cannot be doubted that Mrs. Methven’s bosom throbbed with a great pang of disappointment when she sat and smiled to conceal it, and answered questions about Walter, yet could not say that she had seen him or any of his “places in Scotland,” or knew much more than her questioners did. When his message arrived her heart leapt in her breast. There were no explanations, no reason given, but that imperative call, such as mothers love to have addressed to them: “Come;” all considerations of her own comfort set aside in the necessity for her which had arisen at last. Another might have resented so complete an indifference to what might happen to suit herself. But there are connections and relationships in which this is the highest compliment. He knew that it did not matter to her what her own convenience was, as long as he wanted her. She got up from her chair at once, and proceeded to put her things together to get ready for the journey. With a smiling countenance she prepared herself for the night train. She would not even take a maid. “He says, alone. He must have some reason for it, I suppose,” she said to Miss Merivale. “I am the reason,” said Cousin Sophy: “He doesn’t want me. You can tell him, with my love, that to travel all night is not at all in my way, and he need have had no fear on that subject.” But Mrs. Methven would not agree to this, and departed hurriedly without any maid. She was surprised a little, yet would not allow herself to be displeased, that no one came to meet her: but it was somewhat forlorn to be set down on the side of the loch in the wintry afternoon, with the cold, gleaming water before her, and no apparent way of getting to the end of her journey.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh yes, mem, you might drive round the head of the loch: but it’s a long way,” the landlady of the little inn said, smoothing down her apron at the door, “and far simpler just crossing the water, as everybody does in these parts.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Methven was a little nervous about crossing the water. She was tired and disappointed, and a chill had crept to her heart. While she stood hesitating a young lady came up, whose boat waited for her on the beach, a man in a red shirt standing at the bow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It is a lady for Auchnasheen, Miss Oona,” said the landlady, “and no boat. Duncan is away, and for the moment I have not a person to send: and his lordship will maybe be out on the hill, or he will have forgotten, or maybe he wasna sure when to expect you, mem?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, he did not know when to expect me. I hope there is no illness,” said Mrs. Methven, with a thrill of apprehension.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At this the young lady came forward with a shy yet frank grace.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “If you will let me take you across,” she said, “my boat is ready. I am Oona Forrester. Lord Erradeen is quite well I think, and I heard that he expected—his mother.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes,” said Mrs. Methven. She gave the young stranger a penetrating look. Her own aspect was perhaps a little severe, for her heart had been starved and repressed, and she wore it very warm and low down in her bosom, never upon her sleeve. There rose over Oona’s countenance a soft and delicate flush under the eyes of Walter’s mother. She had nothing in the world to blush for, and probably that was why the colour rose. They were of infinite interest to each other, two souls meeting, as it were, in the dark, quite unknown to each other and yet—who could tell?—to be very near perhaps in times to come. The look they interchanged was a mutual question. Then Mrs. Methven felt herself bound to take up her invariable defence of her son.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He did not, most likely, think that I could arrive so soon. I was wrong not to let him know. If I accept your kindness will it be an inconvenience to you?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This question was drowned in Oona’s immediate response and in the louder protest of Mrs. Macfarlane. “Bless me, mem, you canna know the loch! for there is nobody but would put themselves about to help a traveller: and above all Miss Oona, that just has no other thought. Colin, put in the lady’s box intill the boat, and Hamish, he will give ye a hand.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thus it was settled without farther delay. It seemed to the elder lady like a dream when she found herself afloat upon this unknown water, the mountains standing round, with their heads all clear and pale in the wonderful atmosphere from which the last rays of the sunset had but lately faded, while down below in this twilight scene the colour had begun to go out of the autumn trees and red walls of the ruined castle, at which she looked with a curiosity full of excitement. “That is——?” she said pointing with a strange sensation of eagerness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That is Kinloch Houran,” said Oona, to whose sympathetic mind, she could not tell how, there came a tender, pitying comprehension of the feelings of the mother, thus thrust alone and without any guide into the other life of her son.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It is very strange to me—to see the place where Walter——You know perhaps that neither my son nor I were ever here until he——”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh yes,” Oona said hastily, interrupting the embarrassed speech; and she added, “My mother and I have been here always, and everybody on the loch knows everybody else. We were aware——”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then she paused too; but her companion took no notice, her mind being fully occupied. “I feel,” she said, “like a woman in a dream.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was very still on the loch, scarcely a breath stirring (which was very fortunate, for Mrs. Methven, unaccustomed, had a little tremor for the dark water even though so smooth). The autumnal trees alone, not quite put out by the falling darkness, seemed to lend a little light as they hung, reflected, over the loch—a redder cluster here and there looking like a fairy lamp below the water. A thousand suggestions were in the air, and previsions of she knew not what, a hidden life surrounding her on every side. Her brain was giddy, her heart full. By-and-by she turned to her young companion, who was so sympathetically silent, and whose soft voice when she spoke, with the little cadence of an accent unfamiliar yet sweet, had a half-caressing sound which touched the solitary woman. “You say your mother and you,” she said. “Are you too an only child?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh no! there are eight of us: but I am the youngest, the only one left. All the boys are away. We live on the isle. I hope you will come and see us. My mother will be glad——”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And she is not afraid to trust you—by yourself? It must be a happy thing for a woman to have a daughter,” Mrs. Methven said, with a sigh. “The boys, as you say, go away.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Nobody here is afraid of the loch,” said Oona. “Accidents happen—oh, very rarely. Mamma is a little nervous about yachting, for the winds come down from the hills in gusts; but Hamish is the steadiest oar, and there is no fear. Do you see now the lights at Auchnasheen? There is some one waiting, at the landing-place. It will be Lord Erradeen, or some one from the house. Hamish, mind the current. You know how it sweeps the boat up the loch?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It will just be the wash of that confounded steam-boat,” Hamish said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The voices bounded in the air without conveying any sense to her mind. Was that Walter, the vague line of darker shadow upon the shade? Was it his house she was going to, his life that she was entering once more? All doubts were put to an end speedily by Walter’s voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Is it Hamish?” he cried out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh, Lord Erradeen, it is me,” cried Oona, in her soft Scotch. “And I am bringing you your mother.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The boat grated on the bank as she spoke, and this disguised the tremor in her voice, which Mrs. Methven, quite incapable of distinguishing anything else, was yet fully sensible of. She stepped out tremulously into her son’s arms.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Mother,” he cried, “what must you think of me for not coming to meet you? I never thought you could be here so soon.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I should have come by telegraph if I could,” she said, with an agitated laugh: so tired, so tremulous, so happy, the strangest combination of feelings overwhelming her. But still she was aware of a something, a tremor, a tingle in Oona’s voice. The boat receded over the water almost without a pause, Hamish under impulsion of a whispered word, having pushed off again as soon as the traveller and her box were landed. Walter paused to call out his thanks over the water, and then he drew his mother’s arm within his, and led her up the bank.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Where is Jane?” he said. “Have you no one with you? Have you travelled all night, and alone, mother, for me?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “For whom should I do it, but for you? And did you think I would lose a minute after your message, Walter? But you are well, there is nothing wrong with your health?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Nothing wrong with my health,” he said, with a half-laugh. “No, that is safe enough. I have not deserved that you should come to me, mother——”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “There is no such word as deserving between mother and son,” she said tremulously, “so long as you want me, Walter.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Take care of those steps,” was all he said. “We are close now to the house. I hope you will find your rooms comfortable. I fear they have not been occupied for some time. But what shall you do without a maid? Perhaps the housekeeper——”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You said to come alone, Walter.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh yes. I was afraid of Cousin Sophy; but you could not think I wanted to impair your comfort, mother? Here we are at the door, and here is Symington, very glad to receive his lady.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But you must not let him call me so.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Why not? You are our lady to all of us. You are the lady of the house, and I bid you welcome to it, mother,” he said, pausing to kiss her. She had a thousand things to forgive, but in that moment they were as though they had not been.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And there was not much more said until she had settled down into possession of the library, which answered instead of a drawing-room: had dined, and been brought back to the glowing peat fire which gave an aromatic breath of warmth and character to a Highland house. When all the business of the arrival had thus been gone through, there came a moment when it was apparent that subjects of more importance must be entered upon. There was a pause, and an interval of complete silence which seemed much longer than it really was. Walter stood before the fire for some time, while she sat close by, her hands clasped in her lap, ready to attend. Then he began to move about uneasily, feeling the compulsion of the moment, yet unprepared with anything to say. At length it was she who began.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You sent for me, Walter?” she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Yes, mother.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Was there nothing more to tell her? He threw into disorder the books on the table, and then he came back again, and once more faced her, standing with his back to the fire.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “My dear,” she said hesitating, “it is with no reproach I speak, but only——There was some reason for sending for me?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He gave once more a nervous laugh.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You have good reason to be angry if you will; but I’ll tell you the truth, mother. I made use of you to get rid of Underwood. He followed me here, and I told him you were coming, and that he could not stay against the will of the mistress of the house. Then I was bound to ask you——”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The poor lady drew back a little, and instinctively put her hand to her heart, in which there was a hot thrill of sensation, as if an arrow had gone in. And then, in the pang of it, she laughed too, and cried—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You were bound, to be sure, to fulfil your threat. And this is why—this is why, Walter——”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She could not say more without being hysterical, and departing from every rule she had made for herself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Meanwhile, Walter stood before her, feeling in his own heart the twang of that arrow which had gone through hers, and the pity of it and wonder of it, with a poignant realisation of all; and yet found nothing to say.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After a while Mrs. Methven regained her composure, and spoke with a smile that was almost more pathetic than tears.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “After all, it was a very good reason. I am glad you used me to get rid of that man.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I always told you, mother,” he said, “that you had a most absurd prejudice against that man. There is no particular harm in the man. I had got tired of him. He is well enough in his own way, but he was out of place here.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, Walter, we need not discuss Captain Underwood. But don’t you see it is natural that I should exaggerate his importance by way of giving myself the better reason for having come?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The touch of bitterness and sarcasm that was in her words made Walter start from his place again, and once more turn over the books on the table. She was not a perfect woman to dismiss all feeling from what she said, and her heart was wrung.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After a while he returned to her again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Mother, I acknowledge you have a good right to be displeased. But that is not all. I am glad, anyhow—heartily glad to have you here.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She looked up at him with her eyes full, and quivering lips. Everything went by impulse in the young man’s mind, and this look—in which for once in his life he read the truth, the eagerness to forgive, the willingness to forget, the possibility, even in the moment of her deepest pain, of giving her happiness—went to his heart. After all it is a wonderful thing to have a human creature thus altogether dependent upon your words, your smile, ready to encounter all things for you, without hesitation, without a grudge. And why should she? What had he ever done for her? And she was no fool. These thoughts had already passed through his mind with a realisation of the wonder of it all, which seldom strikes the young at sight of the devotion of the old. All these things flashed back upon him at the sight of the dumb anguish yet forgiveness in her eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Mother,” he cried, “there’s enough of this between you and me. I want you not for Underwood, but for everything. Why should you care for a cad like me? but you do——”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Care for you? Oh, my boy!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I know; there you sit that have travelled night and day because I held up my finger: and would give me your life if you could, and bear everything, and never change and never tire. Why, in the name of God, why?” he cried with an outburst. “What have I ever done that you should do this for me? You are worth a score of such as I am, and yet you make yourself a slave—”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh, Walter, my dear! how vain are all these words. I am your mother,” she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Presently he drew a chair close to her and sat down beside her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “All these things have been put before me,” he said, “to drive me to despair. I have tried to say that it was this vile lordship, and the burden of the family, that has made me bad, mother. But you know better than that,” he said, looking up at her with a stormy gleam in his face that could not be called a smile, “and so do I.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Walter, God forbid that I should ever have thought you bad. You have been led astray.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “To do—what I wanted to do,” he said with another smile, “that is what is called leading astray between a man and those who stand between him and the devil; but I have talked with one who thinks of no such punctilios. Mother, vice deserves damnation; isn’t that your creed?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Walter!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh, I know; but listen to me. If that were so, would a woman like you stand by the wretch still?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “My dearest boy! you are talking wildly. There are no circumstances, none! in which I should not stand by you.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That is what I thought,” he said, “you and—But they say that you don’t know, you women, how bad a man can be: and that if you knew—And then as for God——”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “God knows everything, Walter.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Ay: and knows that never in my life did I care for or appeal to Him, till in despair. If you think of it, these are not things a man can do, mother: take refuge with women who would loathe him if they knew; or with God, who does know that only in desperation, only when nothing else is left to him, he calls out that name like a spell. Yes, that is all; like an incantation, to get rid of the fiend.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The veins were swollen on Walter’s forehead; great drops of moisture hung upon it; on the other hand his lips were parched and dry, his eyes gleaming with a hot treacherous lustre. Mrs. Methven, as she looked at him, grew sick with terror. She began to think that his brain was giving way.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What am I to say to you?” she cried; “who has been speaking so? It cannot be a friend, Walter. That is not the way to bring back a soul.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He laughed, and the sound alarmed her still more.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “There was no friendship intended,” he said, “nor reformation either. It was intended—to make me a slave.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “To whom, oh! to whom?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had relieved his mind by talking thus; but it was by putting his burden upon her. She was agitated beyond measure by these partial confidences. She took his hands in hers, and pleaded with him—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Oh, Walter, my darling, what has happened to you? Tell me what you mean.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I am not mad, mother, if that is what you think.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I don’t think so, Walter. I don’t know what to think. Tell me. Oh, my boy, have pity upon me; tell me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You will do me more good, mother, if you will tell me—how I am to get this burden off, and be a free man.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “The burden of—what? Sin? Oh, my son!” she cried, rising to her feet, with tears of joy streaming from her eyes. She put her hands upon his head and bade God bless him. God bless him! “There is no doubt about that; no difficulty about that,” she said; “for everything else in the world there may be uncertainty, but for this none. God is more ready to forgive than we are to ask. If you wish it sincerely with all your heart, it is done. He is never far from any of us. He is here, Walter—here, ready to pardon!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He took her hands which she had put upon him, and looked at her, shaking his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Mother, you are going too fast,” he said. “I want deliverance, it is true; but I don’t know if it is that I mean.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That is at the bottom of all, Walter.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He put her softly into her chair, and calmed her agitation; then he began to walk up and down the room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That is religion,” he said. “I suppose it is at the bottom of all. What was it you used to teach me, mother, about a new heart? Can a man enter a second time—and be born? That seems all so visionary when one is living one’s life. You think of hundreds of expedients first. To thrust it away from you, and forget all about it; but that does not answer; to defy it and go the other way out of misery and spite. Then to try compromises; marriage, for instance, with a wife perhaps, one thinks——”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “My dear,” said Mrs. Methven, with a sad sinking of disappointment in her heart after her previous exultation, yet determined that her sympathy should not fail, “if you had a good wife no one would be so happy as I—a good girl who would help you to live a good life.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Here he came up to her again, and, leaning against the table, burst into a laugh. But there was no mirth in it. A sense of the ludicrous is not always mirthful.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “A girl,” he said, “mother, who would bring another fortune to the family: who would deluge us with money, and fill out the lines of the estates, and make peace—peace between me and—And not a bad girl either,” he added with a softening tone, “far too good for me. An honest, upright little soul, only not—the best; only not the one who—would hate me if she knew——”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Walter,” said Mrs. Methven, trembling, “I don’t understand you. Your words seem very wild to me. I am all confused with them, and my brain seems to be going. What is it you mean? Oh, if you would tell me all you mean and not only a part which I cannot understand!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There never happens in any house a conversation of a vital kind, which is not interrupted at a critical moment by the entrance of the servants, those legitimate intruders who can never be staved off. It was Symington now who came in with tea, which, with a woman’s natural desire to prevent any suspicion of agitation in the family, she accepted. When he had gone the whole atmosphere was changed. Walter had seated himself by the fire with the newspapers which had just come in, and all the emotion and attendrissement were over. He said to her, looking up from his reading—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “By-the-bye, mother, Julia Herbert is here with some cousins; they will be sure to call on you. But I don’t want to have any more to do with them than we can help. You will manage that?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Julia Herbert,” she said. The countenance which had melted into so much softness, froze again and grew severe. “Here! why should she be here? Indeed, I hope I shall be able to manage that, as you say.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But oh, what ignoble offices for a woman who would have given her life for him as he knew! To frighten away Underwood, to “manage” Julia. Patience! so long as it was for her boy.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1473/44203.html","bookId":1358,"creation":"Aug 4, 2019 1:20:25 AM","modification":"Aug 4, 2019 1:20:25 AM"}
