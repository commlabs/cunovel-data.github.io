{"id":27836,"no":27,"title":"Chapter 27 Clayton","content":"Clayton knew by her expression that he had her attention but wasn\u0027t sure she understood the implications. \"He has a photograph of you,\" he went on, \"and when he first got to town, he flashed it around Decker\u0027s Pool Hall. Tony was there that night and he saw it. Actually, he called me right away because he thought the guy\u0027s story sounded weird, but I didn\u0027t think much of it. Last weekend, though, Tony came by to tell me that he recognized Thibault when he was playing the piano at church.\" Beth could only stare at him. \"I don\u0027t know if Drake gave it to him, or if he took it from Drake. But I figure that\u0027s the only thing that makes sense. Both Drake and Thibault were in the marines, and according to Tony, the picture was an older one, taken a few years ago.\" He hesitated. \"I know that what I told you about the way I behaved might make it seem like I\u0027m trying to run him off, but I\u0027m not going to talk to him. I do think that you should, however, and I\u0027m not saying this because I\u0027m your ex-husband. I\u0027m saying this as a deputy sheriff.\" Beth wanted to walk away but couldn\u0027t seem to find the will to move. Think about it. He had a picture of you, and based only on that, he walked across the country to find you. I don\u0027t know why, but I can make a pretty good guess. He was obsessed with you even though you\u0027d never met, like someone who gets obsessed with movie stars. And what did he do? He hunted you down, but seeing you from afar—or simply meeting you—wasn\u0027t enough. Instead, he had to become part of your life. That\u0027s what dangerous stalkers do, Beth.\" His tone was calm and professional, which only intensified the dread she\u0027d begun to feel. \"By your expression, I know that all of this is news to you. You\u0027re wondering if I\u0027m telling the truth or if I\u0027m lying, and my track record isn\u0027t perfect. But, please, for Ben\u0027s sake—for your own sake—ask him about it. I can be there if you want me to be there, or I could even send another deputy if you\u0027d prefer that. Or you can call someone else—your friend Melody. I just want you to understand how serious this is. How… creepy and weird this is. This is scary stuff, and I can\u0027t impress on you enough how important it is that you take it seriously, too.\" His mouth was set in a straight line as he set the file on a child\u0027s desk beside him. \"This is some general information on Logan Thibault. I didn\u0027t have time to dig too deep, and I can get in big trouble for even letting you see this, but since I don\u0027t know what else he hasn\u0027t told you…\" He trailed off before looking up at her again. \"Think about what I told you. And be careful, okay?\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2101/59651.html","bookId":521,"creation":"Aug 4, 2019 2:23:27 AM","modification":"Aug 4, 2019 2:23:27 AM"}
