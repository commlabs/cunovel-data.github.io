They were both less than six feet tall, their skin was rough and gravelly, and they wore glazed white earnings.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eUpon further inspection, these earrings weren’t some precious stone at all, but rather teeth.

To see a fresh face here is quite exciting.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming’s expression was indifferent. He calmly took out his Phoenix Blood Spear. In such a desert, killing and robbing someone likely wasn’t uncommon at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Ho, you seem quite brave.” Another martial artist looked at Lin Ming’s spear with disdain. “You’re just a small hairless little boy, and yet you’re so confident in your own strength?

Trying to obtain some harvests really isn’t easy, hahaha.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThere were hundreds of thousands or even millions of transmission points in the Asura Road; it was impossible to count them all. Some transmission points were even random. They would be in one location for a few months before swapping over to somewhere new.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, there were some experienced bandits that had some unique abilities or methods to search for transmission points. They would camp around these transmission points and especially wait for ‘newbies’ to enter the Asura Road.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe strength of newcomers was normally weaker than most. However, since they would have just entered the Asura Road to adventure, they would often carry a great deal of supplies with them. This was an extremely good effort to reward ratio. After killing one of these newbies, the profits from such an endeavor were extremely high.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOf course, if these robbers were to run into some cruel and ruthless people they would simply avoid them. After all, those people had just entered the Asura Road so how would they know that the people camping around the area were robbers? Unless they were perverted murderers, why would they randomly start killing?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThus, squatting over a location to wait for newcomers was an extremely safe hunting method. These people were widely known as ‘vultures’.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs vultures, they had to learn an ability that could quickly and accurately ascertain the cultivation of others. Otherwise, they could easily kick the wall with some mistake.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn the Asura Road, quickly discerning the cultivation of others wasn’t easy at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Asura Road was filled with countless different races. Although every race had to follow one of the three great cultivation systems of essence gathering, body transformation, or soul forging, each race used different cultivation methods to do so. And, these robbers had accumulated a great deal of experience about these various cultivation methods.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNow, they could immediately see that Lin Ming’s cultivation was lower than both of theirs.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThey suppressed him in cultivation and this was also two against one.

Hahaha!” A man laughed, “What do you think?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Essence gathering system, Divine Transformation realm human, and also a little defenseless boy. Your talent is quite good but you shouldn’t be over a hundred years old.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Eh? Your mortal body is tempered quite nicely.

Lin Ming was startled as he heard all of this. These two people were quite skilled in seeing through his cultivation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThey weren’t humans but they could actually discern his cultivation realm and even see his dual body and energy cultivation path. As for Lin Ming, he didn’t know anything about these two people’s cultivation systems at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt was obvious that these two people cultivated something Lin Ming had never seen before. It was some cultivation method that didn’t belong to the humans, saints, or demons, but still had to be one of the 33 different Heavenly Daos.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming could just barely sense their aura to roughly judge their approximate strength and then translate that into human cultivation levels.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“…Alright, but if he cannot be raised well then it will be a bit of a waste. Those runes are extremely rare. If we sell them we can trade them for a great deal of good things…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It should be possible. We only need to raise him for three to five years before we can use him. He should make a good slave puppet. If he becomes stronger and we can use him to hunt greater prey then the price will be worth it. If there’s danger, he can also protect the rear…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs they two men spoke, Lin Ming was bewildered. What were they speaking about? They wanted to turn him into a slave puppet?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, one of these two vultures began to shine. His entire body lit up with a gray light as runes shone around him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Runes?” Lin Ming immediately went on complete alert.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn the outside world, when Lin Ming fought with his enemies, he had seen countless runes and things similar to runes.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhether they were Law fragments, seals, or even patterns and lines, all of them were similar to these god runes.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eTowards these runes, Lin Ming never cared too much.

These were definitely the god runes that Empyrean Divine Dream had spoken about!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThese god runes only existed in the Asura Road and corresponded to the special Heavenly Dao rules here.

However, these runes were different. They were an independent strength that didn’t belong to the martial artist but originated from the power of the Heavenly Dao Laws.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn a sense, a martial artist used themselves as a medium to directly borrow extra power from the Heavenly Dao.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLike this, god runes could be used to greatly increase a martial artist’s combat strength.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Surprised? It seems this is your first time seeing god runes. Hehe, no wonder, you’re nothing but a newbie! Let me tell you something: the Asura Road is not for little children like you to wander around in!

These god runes can strengthen a martial artist to a certain degree, but they won’t be too heaven-defying. Otherwise, a child who couldn’t wrestle a chicken would be able to exterminate a Holy Lord if they had enough god runes with them. After all, these runes have the support of the Heavenly Dao rules and are nearly impossible to dodge.
