Huge crowd. Of course the article HAD to mention the fact that some people doubted that Juan Diego had ever existed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what did that matter to the faithful like me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly after I had devoured all the articles on the Pope\u0027s travels did I realize there was a note lying on the desk from one of the guards, saying that Michael Curry had come by in the afternoon and asked if I might call him. No one was answering the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d come back so late last night that I had not seen Mona and Quinn, and they had not yet risen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flat was ominously quiet. Apparently it was too early for Julien and Stella as well. Or maybe my last speech had routed Julien for a while. But I didn\u0027t think so. He was, if anything, probably more energized and waiting for a moment in which to strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was about to pick up the phone and call the number which Michael had given to the guard when I realized that Michael had just come to the carriageway below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went down to meet him. The evening was all aglow and full of the scent of the kitchens of the Quarter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI motioned for the guards to let Michael come on back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was in a frantic state. He was wearing the same three-piece white suit as yesterday, shirt now open and tie gone, and he was all rumpled and smudged with dirt and his hair was mussed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter, man?\" I asked, as I reached to take his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. He was choking on the words he wanted to say. His thoughts were scrambled. On some unconscious level he blocked me from reading him, while appealing to me at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI led him into the courtyard. He was sweating badly. The garden was just too hot. I had to take him in where the artificial winds blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" I said. \"Let\u0027s go upstairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMona appeared in the doorway just as we reached the back parlor, pretty blue silk dress, heels strapped at the ankles, just her hair tousled from bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uncle Michael, what\u0027s wrong!\" She was instantly distraught.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, baby,\" Michael said weakly. \"You\u0027re sure looking fine.\" He collapsed on the velvet sofa and he put his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it, Uncle Michael?\" she said, obviously shy of touching him, settling uncertainly on the edge of a nearby chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Rowan,\" he said. \"She\u0027s gone out of her mind, and I don\u0027t know if we can bring her back this time. It\u0027s worse than it ever was before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me. \"I came here to ask you point blank if you\u0027d help. You have a power over her. You calmed her last night. You might be able to do it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what\u0027s happening to her?\" Mona asked. \"Is she catatonic like before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught only jumbled images from Michael\u0027s mind. He didn\u0027t appear to register Mona\u0027s question. I had to settle for his words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stirling\u0027s with her now,\" Michael said, \"but he\u0027s not getting through. This morning she insisted she wanted to go to Confession. I called Fr. Kevin. They were alone for about an hour. Of course he can\u0027t tell anybody what she said. You ask me, I think Fr. Kevin\u0027s on the brink too. You can\u0027t take a regular priest like Fr. Kevin and plunge him into a family like ours, and expect him to survive, expect him to represent something, expect him to exercise his priestly functions. It\u0027s not fair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Michael,\" I said. \"What is Rowan doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t seem to hear me. He went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mayfair Medical, all her work on it has been frenetic, you know that, or at least you did know that-\" he looked at Mona-\"but nobody else really realizes it, that she works to the point of exhaustion so that there will be no inner life, no quiet life, no life of the mind other than that which is locked to Mayfair Medical, it\u0027s a complete vocation, yeah, marvelous, but it\u0027s also a complete escape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A mania,\" said Mona quietly. She was badly shaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" said Michael. \"Her public persona is the only persona she really has. The interior Rowan has utterly disintegrated. Or it has to do with the secrets of Mayfair Medical. And now this breakdown, this complete disconnection, this madness. Do you realize how many people are riding on her energy? Her example? She\u0027s created a world that\u0027s dependent upon her-members of the family from all over come here to study medicine, the new wing is under way at the hospital, there\u0027s the Brain Study Program, she\u0027s monitoring four research projects, I don\u0027t even know the half of it. You chuck my own selfish needs, and then there\u0027s all that-.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What actually happened?\" I pushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last night she lay on the bed for hours. She was whispering things. I couldn\u0027t hear her. She wouldn\u0027t talk to me. She wouldn\u0027t come out of it. She wouldn\u0027t dress for bed, or take anything to eat or drink. I lay beside her-what you told me to do. I held her. I even sang to her. Irish people do that, you know. We sing when we\u0027re melancholy. It\u0027s the strangest thing. I thought I was the only one. Then I realized all Mayfairs do it. That\u0027s the Tyrone McNamara blood down through Oncle Julien. I sang these melancholy songs to her. I fell asleep. When I woke up, she was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found her in the back garden on the lawn under the oak. She was barefoot out there, in her pretty silk suit, digging, digging where the remains were.\" He looked at Mona. \"She was in her bare feet and she was digging with one of the gardener\u0027s big shovels. She was talking to herself about Emaleth and Lasher\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand she was cursing herself. When I tried to stop her, she hit me. I tried to remind her she\u0027d had the remains removed. As soon as Mayfair Medical was complete, she had had a team out to scour for the remains.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emaleth and Lasher?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember,\" said Mona. \"I was there when it happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was crazy that day,\" Michael said. \"She kept repeating herself. She said that she belonged in the Talamasca. They sifted through that dirt like a pack of archaeologists. Yeah, you saw them, and that fragrance, it was so strong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMona was fighting back her usual tears. My heart went out to both of them. They were prisoners of these secrets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on,\" said Mona.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tried to tell her. They\u0027d excavated the entire area. They\u0027d brought everything to Mayfair Medical. She didn\u0027t seem to understand. I told her what she\u0027d told me at the time. It was cartilage, cartilage of an infinitely more elastic species . . . that it wasn\u0027t even the scene of a crime! But she wasn\u0027t listening. She keeps pacing and talking to herself. She says I don\u0027t know who she is. She\u0027s always told me that. She started talking again about joining the Talamasca, retiring into the Order. As if it was a convent. She said she belonged there. In the Talamasca. In the old days, when women had done evil things they could be sent to monasteries. She said she would make a bequest to the Talamasca, and they would take her, they would take the Mad Scientist, because that\u0027s who she really was. Mona, she doesn\u0027t believe in my understanding. She doesn\u0027t believe in my power to forgive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, Uncle Michael.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a moral child in her mind,\" Michael said, his voice shaky. \"And then she said the worst thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" asked Mona.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She said that you were . . . you were dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMona didn\u0027t reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I kept telling her you were fine. We\u0027d just seen you. You were all right, you were cured. She kept shaking her head. \u0027Mona\u0027s not alive anymore.\u0027 That\u0027s what she said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael looked at me. \"Lestat, will you come?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was vaguely amazed. This man was highly intuitive, but he was seeing in me only what he wanted to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you talk to her?\" he asked. \"You had such a soothing effect on her. I saw it with my own eyes. If you and Mona could come. Bring Quinn. Rowan loves Quinn. Rowan doesn\u0027t notice many people. But she\u0027s always loved Quinn. Maybe because Quinn can see spirits, I don\u0027t know. Maybe because Quinn and Mona love each other, I don\u0027t know. She loved Quinn from the first time he came to call on Mona years ago. She\u0027s always trusted in Quinn. But Lestat, if you could talk to her . . . and Mona, if you could come and show her that you\u0027re alive, show her that you\u0027re fine, just hold her. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Michael, listen to me,\" I said. \"I want you to go home. Quinn and Mona and I have to talk this over. We\u0027ll come to you or call you as soon as we can. Be assured, we\u0027re very concerned about Rowan. There\u0027s no other concern on our minds right now except Rowan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat back on the couch, closed his eyes and took a long breath. He looked defeated. \"I was hoping you\u0027d come back with me,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Believe me,\" I said, \"our little consultation won\u0027t take long. We have strong obligations. We\u0027ll call or come just as quickly as we can.\" I hesitated. \"We love Rowan,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up, heaved a sigh and headed for the door. I asked if he needed a ride back home and he murmured that his car had brought him downtown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked back at Mona. She\u0027d stood up but she was afraid to embrace him, that was plain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uncle Michael, I love you,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sweetheart,\" he said, \"if I had my life to live over again and could just erase that one night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t think about it, Uncle Michael,\" she said. \"How many times do I have to tell you? I climbed in the back window, for God\u0027s sakes. It was all my fault, from start to finish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was unconvinced. \"I took advantage of you, baby,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Michael, it was Oncle Julien too,\" Mona said. \"It was Oncle Julien\u0027s spell. He made a big mistake. Besides, it doesn\u0027t matter now, don\u0027t you see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was stunned again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at her, narrowing his eyes. I couldn\u0027t figure whether he wanted a blurred focus or a fine one. It was as though he saw her loveliness afresh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you do look so good,\" he sighed. \"My sweetheart.\" He closed the gap between them and embraced her totally, a bear of a man enfolding her. \"My darling girl,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey rocked together, his arms completely enclosing her. He suspected nothing. He drifted in a dream. And she, newborn thing that she was, felt like a peach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last he broke away and said wearily that he had to return to Rowan, and I told him again that we would call him very soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me for a long moment, as though he was seeing me with new eyes, but it was only his weariness. He was seeing what he wanted to see in me, and he thanked me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She called you Rasputin when she was angry,\" he said. \"Well, I tell you, Lestat, you do have that sort of power and it\u0027s a good thing. I can sense the good in you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How in the world can you do that?\" I asked. To ask that honest question felt extraordinarily sweet. This was truly one of the most baffling mortals I\u0027d ever met. And to think, he washer husband, and I\u0027d thought him the perfect husband for her when we\u0027d first met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached out and took my hand before I could stop him. Couldn\u0027t he feel how hard it was? Only the thinnest layer of flesh was permeable. I was a monster. Yet he peered into my eyes as though plumbing for something separate from the Deadly Sins that prevailed within me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re good,\" he said, confirming it for himself. \"You think I\u0027d let you hold my wife in your arms if I didn\u0027t sense it? You think I\u0027d let you kiss her cheek? You think I\u0027d come to plead with you to calm my wife when I couldn\u0027t if I didn\u0027t know you were good? I don\u0027t make mistakes of that order. I\u0027ve been with the dead. The dead have come to me and surrounded me. They\u0027ve talked to me. They\u0027ve taught me things. I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held fast. I nodded. \"I\u0027ve been with the dead too,\" I said. \"They left me in confusion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you asked too much of them,\" he said gently. \"I think when the dead come to us they are crippled creatures. They look to us for their completion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said. \"I think that\u0027s true. And without a doubt I failed them. But I was with angels too and they asked too much of me and I refused them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA look of quiet shock passed over his face. \"Yes, you said it before. Angels. I can\u0027t imagine being with angels.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind my words,\" I said. \"I talk too much of my own wounds and failures. With Rowan, something can be done, and I promise you, we will see to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Just come to the house, please, all of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you and Rowan alone there?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stirling Oliver is there, but-,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s fine. He can stay,\" I replied. \"We\u0027ll be there very soon. Wait there for us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded with a half smile that was trusting and grateful and kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went on out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood trembling, listening to him make the stairs, and then the carriageway. I shut my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA solemn silence fell over the room. I knew Quinn had come to the door. I struggled to gain control of my heart. I struggled. Mona cried softly into her handkerchief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mona of a Thousand Tears,\" I said. I fought them myself. I won. \"How could he have so totally misunderstood me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he didn\u0027t,\" said Quinn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes, he did,\" I insisted. \"Sometimes I think the theologians have got it backwards. The big problem is not How to explain the existence of evil in this world. It\u0027s How to explain the existence of good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t believe that,\" said Quinn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I do,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fell into a sudden trance, thinking of the Pope in the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City with the \"Indigenous people\" dancing in their feathered headdresses. I wondered if the Spaniards would have murdered those Indians in their feathered headdresses for doing that on consecrated ground two centuries ago or three or four. Well, Hell, it didn\u0027t matter. Saint Juan Diego would protect everyone now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered in order to clear my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat on the couch. I had to ponder what I\u0027d learnt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it was Michael who fathered your child,\" I said to Mona as gently as I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she answered. She sat beside me. She put her hand over mine. \"There are so many things I\u0027m not free to tell. But at the time, Rowan wasn\u0027t there. Rowan . . . Rowan did a terrible thing. I can\u0027t tell what Rowan did. Rowan left Michael. Rowan was the thirteenth witch. I can\u0027t tell it. But Rowan left Michael on Christmas Day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on, you were talking about Michael,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was weeks later. The house was all dark. I climbed in the window. Michael was supposed to be sick. He was grieving for Rowan. I crept up there to his room. I knew he wasn\u0027t sick as soon as I touched him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn sat down close to us. I realized he\u0027d heard our conversation with Michael. He didn\u0027t care for what Mona was telling me. It came as a huge shock to him that Michael had fathered the child of which he knew so little. But he remained quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then Oncle Julien cast a spell on both of us,\" said Mona. \"He brought us together. He was trying to help Michael stop grieving over Rowan. He wanted to prove to Michael that Michael wasn\u0027t really sick. But I wanted it. I really wanted it. I was being the Wander Slut in those days. I kept a list on my computer of all the cousins I seduced. I seduced my cousin Randall, and I think he was eighty then. He nearly shot himself on account of it. Me being thirteen and all that. It was perfectly disgusting. I had to confess to my Aunt Bea that I\u0027d seduced Randall and ask her to come bring the medics-Oh, never mind. But he\u0027s just fine now. Imagine. I like to think he\u0027s lived to be ninety, thanks to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course,\" said Quinn dryly. \"But with Michael you conceived the child.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Mona. \"The child that they took away from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was giving birth to the Woman Child,\" I said, \"that brought on the wasting sickness, and the sickness wouldn\u0027t stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Mona answered. \"At first we didn\u0027t know what was happening. It came on very gradually. I had a little time. What good is it now to talk about these things? Rowan dug up the remains beneath the tree because she was trying to find something that might help me. At least in part that was the reason. But it doesn\u0027t matter now. What do we do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But who were the creatures buried beneath the tree?\" I asked. \"Michael called them Emaleth and Lasher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those are their secrets,\" Mona insisted. \"Look, I escaped it all, on account of you, both of you. But there\u0027s no escape for Rowan, is there? Except Mayfair Medical. Except project after project. No. But I have to demand the truth from her. Did she try to find my child or not? Did she lie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would she lie?\" Quinn asked. \"What would have been her motive? Don\u0027t you see, Mona, Lestat and I can\u0027t comprehend these things unless you tell us what they mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMona\u0027s face grew dark. She was so pretty that it couldn\u0027t look sour, no matter how dreadful her thoughts. \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said, tossing her hair. \"I just had the feeling sometimes that if Rowan could get one of them . . . the mutation, the other species . . . she\u0027d lock them up in Mayfair Medical until she\u0027d run every test she could to see what their flesh or their breast milk or their blood could do for human beings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The other species?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Their breast milk in particular, it had curative properties. I used to lie there in the dark and imagine that my daughter was somewhere locked in the building. It was a fantasy. Rowan would force drinks on me. I\u0027d imagine the breast milk of my daughter was mixed in it. It\u0027s all wrapped up in what the mutation is. But it doesn\u0027t matter now. What does matter is now we have to help Rowan, and I still have to get the truth from her-how I go about finding my daughter myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You still want to find her?\" Quinn repeated, as if he hadn\u0027t really understood. \"Even now, after what\u0027s happened to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Mona. \"Especially now. I\u0027m no longer human, am I? We\u0027re equals now, me and Morrigan, don\u0027t you see? Morrigan will live for centuries and so will I! That is-if Rowan\u0027s been telling the truth all these years, if she doesn\u0027t know where my daughter is, if my daughter\u0027s really still alive. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another species,\" I said, \"not really a mutation. Babies that grow to maturity soon after birth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The curse of the family . . . I can\u0027t explain it-,\" Mona protested. \"Don\u0027t you understand? Only a tiny number of the Mayfairs know what happened. All the rest live in blissful innocence! That\u0027s the irony. The family is so large and so good, so very good. They really have no idea what happened, they never saw, they never experienced, they never knew-.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand your loyalty to them,\" I said. \"But don\u0027t you see that Quinn and you and I are a family now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"I\u0027m a Mayfair,\" she said. \"What can I do to change it? Nothing. Even the Dark Blood doesn\u0027t change it. I\u0027m a Mayfair, and that\u0027s why we have to go there. I have no choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When Oncle Julien appeared to Quinn,\" I said, \"to tell Quinn that he had Mayfair blood in his veins, Oncle Julien knew about the species? He feared Quinn would have the genes for the species?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" said Mona. \"Don\u0027t ask me any more questions. So many bad things happened! By that time Oncle Julien knew because we knew. He wanted to keep Quinn and me apart. But so much damage was done to me by Morrigan\u0027s birth it didn\u0027t matter. I couldn\u0027t have another child of any kind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morrigan,\" I said. \"Did you love this creature? Did she have intellect? Could she speak?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t imagine what it\u0027s like to give birth to one of these creatures,\" said Mona. \"They speak to you even from the womb, they know you, and you know them, and they\u0027re hardwired with the knowledge of their kind-.\" She broke off as if she\u0027d shattered a vow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my arm around her and I kissed her, and brushed the veil of hair back which separated us and kissed her cheek again. She quieted. I loved the texture of her skin. I loved the feel of her lips when my fingers touched them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn watched these things but he didn\u0027t resent me any more than Michael had with Rowan. I withdrew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want me to go there alone?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, absolutely not,\" cried Mona. \"I want to see Rowan. I want to make her tell me. Is it true my child has never, never, ever tried to reach me? I have to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027ve both told me what we\u0027ll do,\" I said soberly. \"We\u0027ll exchange secrets. That becomes the framework of our dialogue. We tell Rowan and Michael exactly what we are. And they tell us about the Woman Child and if they know anything at all to aid Mona in her search. They reveal to us the things that Mona can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMona looked up. Her eyes appeared to focus more clearly. I looked at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you willing, my darling one?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Mona said. \"It\u0027s really their story, not mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mona, you almost died in this story,\" I said. \"How could it not be yours as well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I forced my way into it,\" she said. \"I wanted Michael. And she\u0027d deserted him. All those nights in the hospital-I wondered, had she really forgiven me? And my child had lived and-.\" She shook her head and raised her hand as though to banish a specter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stroked her hair back from her forehead. She inclined to me, and I kissed her forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to go there, Beloved Boss!\" she whispered. \"We promised Michael. She\u0027s got to tell me the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is all wrong,\" said Quinn. He shook his head. He clearly didn\u0027t like the idea at all. No one at Blackwood Farm knew Quinn\u0027s secrets. Even his clever Aunt Queen had died believing him her innocent boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the only way to save the sanity of Rowan Mayfair,\" I said. \"She knows but she doesn\u0027t know for sure, and it will eat at her and it will obsess her, and on account of her bond with Mona, she and Michael will never let it go. The damage has been done. Only some form of truth will repair it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right,\" said Mona. \"But if they tell you and Quinn about the Taltos, if they take you into their trust, tell you things that even most all of the Mayfairs don\u0027t know, there will be a bond, and maybe that bond can somehow save us all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaltos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that was the name of this species. That was the name of the creature of the curious fragrance and the back-garden graves and the dying womb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Michael and Rowan have obviously kept one terrible set of secrets,\" I said. \"They\u0027re fit to keep another. And the innocent Mayfairs will come to receive Mona. And her life won\u0027t have to be of the shadows. She\u0027ll come and go as you do, Quinn. That\u0027s the way it will work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn studied me silently, respectfully. Then he spoke up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you in love with Rowan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t matter one way or the other,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMona flashed on me, the blood rising in her cheeks very hot, and her eyes quivering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntense, painful moment. Why was my soul not crusted over with barnacles for every life I\u0027d taken? I spoke with the tongue of a mortal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going there to save Rowan, are we not?\" I said. \"Quinn, call for a car, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left them and opened the door and went out onto the rear balcony. The breeze had picked up. The banana trees were dancing against the brick walls. I could see the white roses in the dark. An illicit fire\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eburnt inside me. \" \u0027The rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys,\u0027 \" I whispered. \" \u0027Thou art all fair, my love, there is no spot in thee.\u0027 \" How reverently the wind received these strange words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would have liked the long way-a walk uptown through streets narrow and wide, the open-mouthed roar of the streetcar or its heavy metal clatter through Chrondelet Street, the vision of the pilgrim oaks struggling on lower St. Charles Avenue, the festering flowers of the Garden District, and the glistening moss on the bricks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was no time for that except in my memory. My heart was thudding. And in Quinn\u0027s heart my heart was on trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know,\" Mona said as we waited at the curb for the limousine. \"I haven\u0027t seen the house on First and Chestnut for two years. The day the ambulance came I thought I\u0027d be back in a week or two, like always. Hmmm. I wonder if Oncle Julien\u0027s on the prowl in the old rooms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, darling, I thought, though I didn\u0027t voice it. He\u0027s right across the street, in the shadows of a shop bolted for the night, the discredited spirit, glowering at me. Goddamn you! But who knows, maybe he\u0027ll come along. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-canticle-the-vampire-chronicles-10/page-14.html","bookId":2596,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:56 PM"}
