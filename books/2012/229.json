A familiar face. ‘Your brother?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’m sorry.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. ‘I will see them soon, my queen.

I took care of them all my life, but against this, I wasn’t enough. I failed. It’s too much. From the very start, it was too much.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Tovis stared up at the woman’s face, the dry eyes, the absence of expression. She’s already gone . ‘“They await you on the Shore.”’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA brittle half-smile. ‘So we say over our dead, yes. I remember.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver our dead .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Tell the witches – if they do that to me again – if they use me like that – ever again – I will kill them both.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman flinched. ‘They look ten years old, Highness.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But they aren’t. They’re two old women, sour and bitter and hateful of the world. Go, give them my warning, soldier.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a silent nod, the young woman rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Tovis settled her head, felt the sand grinding against the back of her skull. Empty sky. Dreams of darkness. If I had knelt to the Shore, they couldn’t touch me. Instead, they punished me .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But if they hadn’t,’ she whispered, ‘those Hounds would have killed hundreds more. Which of us, then, is sour and bitter? Hateful of the world?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will go to her. To Kharkanas. I will beg her forgiveness. Neither of us can withstand the weight of this crown. We should cast it off. We can find the strength for that. We must .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, I am a fool. Yedan will not yield. The lives lost must mean something, even when they don’t. So, it seems we must all die. It seems we have no choice. Not the Shake, not the Letherii, not Sandalath Drukorlat, Queen of High House Dark .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached down and came up with a handful of white sand – crumbled bones. ‘It’s all here,’ she whispered. ‘Our entire history, right here. From then … to now. To what’s coming. All … here.’ And she watched, as she closed that hand into a fist, as if to crush it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER SIXTEEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStone whispers\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatience\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we take chisel in hand\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChild begs\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot yet\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the sands have run out\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSky cries\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we hold our ground\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWind sings\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFree\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut roots bind us down\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLover sighs\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStay\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut we must be gone\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLife pleads\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLive\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut death is the dream\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe beg\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot yet\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the sands have run out\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStone whispers\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatience … Incantation Gallan of Kharkanas\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘THERE WILL COME A TIME,’ VENTURED SECHUL LATH, ‘WHEN WE shall be all but forgotten.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Speak for yourself,’ growled Errastas. ‘ And they shall drink blood .
