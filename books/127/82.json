The rings on hisfingers\u0026nbsp; were thick\u0026nbsp; and heavy, his\u0026nbsp; clothes were\u0026nbsp; scented, and he\u0026nbsp; was thefirst\u0026nbsp; man\u0026nbsp; Mallow\u0026nbsp; had\u0026nbsp; met\u0026nbsp; on\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; planet\u0026nbsp; who\u0026nbsp; hadn\u0027t\u0026nbsp; looked\u0026nbsp; hungry.\n\u003cbr\u003e The tech-man\u0027s lips pursed\u0026nbsp; peevishly, \"Now, my man, quickly.
