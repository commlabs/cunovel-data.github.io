Would it not be equally logical to leave the embryo there to begin with - never remove it, never isolate the gametes in a vat at all?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalapine found herself speechless. She sensed a sour taste in her mouth, realized with a feeling of shock that she wanted to vomit. Something\u0027s wrong with my enzyme balance, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spoke slowly, precisely, \u0027I am reporting to pharmacy at once, Schruille. I do not feel well.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027By all means,\u0027 Schruille said. He glanced up and around at the watching scanners - a full circle of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelicately, Calapine eased herself out of the throne, slid down the beam, to the lock segment. Before letting herself out, she cast a look up at the dais, faintly remembering. Which Max was... erased? she asked herself. We\u0027ve had many of him... a successful model for our Security. She thought of the others. Max after Max after Max, each shunted aside when his appearance began to annoy his masters. They stretched into infinity, images in an endless system of mirrors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is erasure to such as Max? She wondered. I am an unbroken continuity of existence. But a doppelganger doesn\u0027t remember. A doppelganger breaks the continuity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless the cells remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMemory... cells... embryos...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought of the embryo within Lizbeth Durant. Disgusting, but simple. So beautifully simple. Her gorge began to rise. Whirling, Calapine dropped down to the Hall of Counsel, ran for the nearest pharmacy outlet. As she ran, she clenched the hand that had slain Max and helped destroy a megalopolis. Seventeen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027SHE\u0027S sick, I tell you!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarvey bent over Igan shaking him out of sleep. They were in a narrow earth-walled room, ceiling of plasmeld beams, a dim yellow glowglobe in one corner. Sleeping pads were spread against the walls, Boumour and Igan on two of them foot to foot, the bound form of Svengaard on another, two of the pads empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Come quickly!\u0027 Harvey pleaded. \u0027She\u0027s sick.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgan groaned, sat up. He glanced at his watch - almost sunset on the surface. They\u0027d crawled in here just before daylight and after a night of laboring on foot up seemingly endless woods trails behind a Forest Patrol guide. Igan still ached from the unaccustomed exercise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLizbeth sick?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d had three days since the embryo had been placed within her. The others had healed this rapidly, but they hadn\u0027t been subject to a night of stumbling along rough forest trails\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Please hurry,\u0027 Harvey pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m coming,\u0027 Igan said. And he thought. Listen to his tone change now that he needs me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoumour sat up opposite him, asked, \u0027Shall I join you?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Wait here for Glisson,\u0027 Igan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Did Glisson say where he was going?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027To arrange for another guide. It\u0027ll be dark soon.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Doesn\u0027t he ever sleep?\u0027 Boumour asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Please!\u0027 Harvey begged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes!\u0027 Igan snapped. \u0027What\u0027re her symptoms?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Vomiting... incoherent.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Let me get my bag.\u0027 Igan retrieved a thick black case from the floor near his head, glanced across at Svengaard. The man\u0027s breathing still showed the even rhythm of the narcotic they\u0027d administered before collapsing into sleep themselves. Something had to be done about Svengaard. He slowed them down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarvey pulled at Igan\u0027s sleeve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m coming! I\u0027m coming!\u0027 Igan said. He freed his arm, followed Harvey through a low hole at the end of the room and into a room similar to the one they\u0027d just vacated. Lizbeth lay on a pad beneath a single glowglobe across from them. She groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarvey knelt beside her. \u0027I\u0027m right here.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Harvey,\u0027 she whispered. \u0027Oh, Harvey.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgan joined them, lifted a pulmonometer-sphagnomometer from his bag. He pressed it against her neck, read the dial. \u0027Where do you hurt?\u0027 he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Ohhhh,\u0027 she moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Please,\u0027 Harvey said, looking at Igan. \u0027Please do something.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Stand out of the way,\u0027 Igan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarvey stood up, backed off two steps. \u0027What is it?\u0027 he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgan ignored him, taped an enzymic vampire gauge to Lizbeth\u0027s left wrist, read the dials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027s wrong with her?\u0027 Harvey demanded. Igan undipped his instruments, restored them to his bag. \u0027Nothing\u0027s wrong with her.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But she\u0027s-\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027She\u0027s perfectly normal.

Pretty soon, she can do without altogether. She\u0027s in better health than you are. And she could walk into a pharmacy right now. The prescription flag wouldn\u0027t even identify her.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Then why\u0027s she...?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s the embryo.

She\u0027ll be extremely hungry in a little while. We\u0027ll give her something to settle her stomach and then feed her.
