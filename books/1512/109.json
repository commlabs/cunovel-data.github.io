It didn\u0027t damage his lungs and was far away from his heart... Just that there is some extravasated blood in his chest. I can\u0027t do open chest surgery here so he will feel some chest pain in the upcoming days. Though it shouldn\u0027t be much of a problem.\" Yinkong checked Zero\u0027s injury and said calmly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng sighed. \"Compared to his injury, I am more worried about you... How are you right now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe newbies were shocked when Zheng and the others came back to the tower. Tengyi died, and the rest were critically injured. This generated fear in the newbies. This was their first movie after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYinkong recovered extremely quickly. She regained\u0026nbsp;most of her mobility after reaching the tower but the arm that was bitten still couldn\u0027t move. As the one most knowledgeable on human anatomy, she naturally took up the job of checking\u0026nbsp;Zero\u0027s injury. Of course, her injury seemed even worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYinkong looked at the shoulder missing a large section\u0026nbsp;of flesh. \"I need hot water, needle, threads, scissor, alcohol and gauze. I recall Egypt has a traditional medicine for physical injuries. It would be best if you can get it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng took a deep breath and said, \"I\u0027m asking how is your injury, not telling you to fix it all by yourself! We will help you get\u0026nbsp;all the tools for the surgery. Don\u0027t worry about anything else. Yours and Zero\u0027s mission right now is to rest until you regain the ability to fight!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYinkong was surprised. \"The blood vessels and tendons on the shoulder were torn. The bones are possibly fractured. There\u0027s no way to recover this arm with the technology of this world, at least not within the next several decades. This arm is useless until we return.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone became silent. Especially when they looked at Tengyi\u0027s body, they felt a sense of despair. Zheng recovered immediately and shouted, \"Team India isn\u0027t much better off. This is the world of horror movies. Anyone can die here. Maybe I will also die on the hands of my enemy or a monster. The only thing we can do is try our best to live!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough they were still feeling down, it was better than the despair from before. Zheng said to O\u0027Connell, \"We are not familiar with Cairo. Please help us buy the tools necessary for surgery. Heng and Liang, go with O\u0027Connell. Remember to stock up on food and drinks too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meat!\" Yinkong suddenly said. \"Meat gives energy. Buy more lean meat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eO\u0027Connell brought the two of them out the tower. Evelyn planned to go with them but Zheng stopped her. When he mentioned Imhotep, she dismissed the idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter everything was set, Honglu said, \"Tell me what happened. I\u0027ve been paying attention to the watch. Ten minutes ago, I received notification that one person in our team died, and we are down one point. Then two minutes after, one person on the other team died. So our current score is zero... Don\u0027t skimp on any details.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng had the two newbies go with O\u0027Connell intentionally. So even if they were to get killed, the team\u0027s fighting power would still be there. Although they would be down two points, this was still the better choice. As the leader of this team, he had to made the choice... This all seemed so similar to Xuan\u0027s methods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe immediately wanted to have a talk with Honglu. The boy\u0027s analytical ability was what is most needed in the current situation. After Honglu asked the question, he described the fight in the museum. Especially every detail on the enemies, their possible abilities and roles, and the werewolf\u0027s destructive power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonglu knelt\u0026nbsp;on one knee and twirled his hair. \"Based on your descriptions, there\u0027s a 70% chance that the muscular giant died. The other possibility is the werewolf European doctor. Of course I prefer the doctor to be the one... The giant\u0027s arm completely recovered so this doctor possess medical abilities we don\u0027t have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s analyze their fighting powers. Arot\u0027s close combat ability is above Yinkong... If you fight him one on one, how likely are you to win?\" Honglu muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng thought for a bit. \"If I\u0026nbsp;go all out, entering the unlocked mode and all other conditions considered... I may win but the most likely outcome is we\u0027d both get injured. The werewolf\u0027s power and speed is higher than the second stage of the unlocked mode.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that so? Then ther is\u0026nbsp;the Indian monk. He can summon a double-headed serpent but his base power level doesn\u0027t look too strong. At least, we can crush the serpent with magical bullets. I think he\u0027s definitely hiding some power. Probably a power that can\u0027t be used too frequently. So he probably won\u0027t use it unless that is his only choice. This is the only explanation on why he can became the leader and not the werewolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aside from these two people, I am most concerned about that needle. It killed Tengyi and injured Zero. The user possess long distance sniping ability. He will be a threat when we fight Team India... The biggest threat is...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of the two women can use a defensive force field. This is a very strong support ability. The other... is our biggest threat, mind control! As long as she\u0027s alive, we won\u0027t be able to beat Team India!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv style\u003d\"clear: both\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-6-chapter-1-2\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-6-chapter-2-1\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-6-chapter-1-3","bookId":1512,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM"}
