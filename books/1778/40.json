Loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he couldn’t stop after it was through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Axe could even recover, the tide was rising again, his hand continuing to work himself out, the sensations surging until his teeth were gritted, and his neck was straining, and his entire body was clenching up.…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWonder what Axwelle was doing? Elise thought as she stepped out of her shower and wrapped herself in a towel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heated marble floor turned the sparkling-white bath mat into a toasty foot pad, and she took her time drying off, wrapping her hair up, and drawing on her thick terry-cloth robe. Aware of an excitement bubbling under her skin, she put on leggings and a different cashmere sweater that was blue as the ocean; then not only hit the blow-dryer, but also the curling iron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe even threw a little eyeliner and mascara on at her vanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout a half hour later, she was wearing her coat and backpack and heading out of her room, spring-in-her-stepping it down the corridor—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she came up to her cousin’s closed door, she hesitated. And wondered whether or not a bodyguard would have helped Allishon. Would being guarded by a soldier have kept her alive?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer to that would be easier if Elise knew what had killed the female.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no time to get into a cognitive lock about all that, though. She hurried down to the first floor and all but tiptoed past the open door to her father’s study in case he decided to recant the whole with-my-blessing thing. But then she remembered. It was Wednesday night. He had his long-standing bridge tournament.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, the night was unseasonably warm, the kind of thing that made her think that the humans with their climate-change theories might be onto something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Axe was right where he’d texted he would be, standing just outside the circle of illumination of the second lantern down the walkway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi,” she said softly. “I’m glad you came for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe coughed a couple of times and shifted his weight in his boots. “Yeah. I said I would.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s do this. Right to the library. I sent your phone the link to the address?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know where we’re going.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a little longer than usual for her to dematerialize … because he had clearly just showered and he’d come with his hair wet, the soap he’d used tinting the night air with something spicy and delicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, he smelled amazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith an inner curse, she forced herself to focus and was off, re-forming miles from her house, in the shadows next to the library’s main entrance. Axe traveled right with her, his massive body materializing next to hers a split second later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re going in over here,” she said needlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be staying back, but not out of range.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay—wait, why are you here?” She waved her hand around. “I mean, what should I tell my professor?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do you have to tell the old guy anything? It’s no one else’s business.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like people aren’t going to notice you?” She laughed a little. “You’re about as invisible as a semi.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Doesn’t mean you have to explain anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she looked up at his intractable face, she respected how unconcerned he was with what others thought. It was a nice change from all the glymera group-think she lived with. “You know, growing up in my family, everything had to be proper, and anything that wasn’t—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked by her, cutting her off. “Come on, let’s do this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a frown, she caught up with him. “You don’t have to be rude.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t have to be your friend, either. I’ve got a job to do, and that’s keep you alive. I’m not here to socialize.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much for starting off on the right foot, she thought, as she pushed open one side of the glass double doors and strode into the library’s lobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of the fact that she had been using the facility for years, she looked around with fresh eyes, noting that the place was the color of oatmeal, everything from the short-napped, wear-like-iron rug, to the washed-out color of the reception desk, to the anemic drapes by the card catalogues like something you’d find in a breakfast bowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We usually meet down here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeading the way, she took her bodyguard past the banks of computers over on the left and then down a distance of stacks to the third open area of tables and chairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTroy was back again where she had left him with those two female students the night before, facing away from her, piles of finals papers fanned out everywhere, his scarf and parka shoved into the chair beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKicking her chin up, she strode in his direction, and when she came up to the table, she put on her widest smile. “Hi.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTory did a double take as he glanced up. “Ah … hello …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time, he shoved his chair back and made like he was going to stand up to greet her—but she motioned him to stay where he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I’m happy to report that I’m back in business,” she announced as she put her things down across from him and took a seat. “You’re not getting rid of me after all.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-vow-black-dagger-legacy-2/page-40.html","bookId":1778,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:46 AM"}
