The Council apparently had decided that kidnapping humans and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eselling them to Night People for food or amusement was just too dangerous. But it sounded as if Quinn\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emight be reviving it, probably without the Council\u0027s permission. How very enterprising of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was right about killing him, too, Rashel thought. There\u0027s no choice now. He\u0027s as bad as I imagined- and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eworse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne was goggling. \"They were going to make me a slave?\" she almost yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sh.\" Rashel glanced at the man behind the doughnut counter. \"I think so. Well-a slave and a sort of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eperpetual food supply if you were sold to vampires. Probably just dinner if you were going to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewerewolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne\u0027s lips repeated werewolves silently. But Rashel was speaking again before she could ask about\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, Daphne-did you get any idea about where you might be going? You said they mentioned a boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut a boat to where? What city?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. They never talked about any city. They just said the boat was ready... and something\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout an aunt-clave.\" She pronounced it ont-clave. \"The girl said, \u0027When we get to the aunt-clave...\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne broke off as Rashel grabbed her wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An enclave,\" Rashel whispered. Thin chills of excitement were running through her. \"They were talking\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout an enclave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne nodded, looking alarmed. \"I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was big. This was... bigger than big. It was incredible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA vampire enclave. The kidnapped girls were being taken to one of the hidden enclaves, one of the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esecret strongholds no vampire hunter had ever managed to penetrate. No human had even discovered\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe location of one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I could get there... if I could get in...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could learn enough to destroy a whole town of vampires. Wipe an enclave off the face of the earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, Rashel? You\u0027re hurting me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry.\" Rashel let go of Daphne\u0027s arm. \"Now, listen,\" she said fiercely. \"I saved your life, right? I mean,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey were going to do terrible things to you. So you owe me, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, sure; sure, I owe you.\" Daphne made pacifying motions with her hands. \"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027m fine. But I need your help. I want you to tell me everything about that club. Everything I need\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto get in-and get chosen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne stared at her. \"I\u0027m sorry; you\u0027re crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. I know what I\u0027m doing. As long as they don\u0027t know I\u0027m a vampire hunter, it\u0027ll be okay. I have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto get to that enclave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne slowly shook her blond head. \"What, you\u0027re going to, like, slay them all? By yourself? Can\u0027t we\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejust tell the police?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not all by myself. I could take a couple of other vampire hunters to help me. And as for the police...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel stopped and sighed. \"Okay. I guess there are some things I should explain. Then maybe you\u0027ll\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunderstand better.\" She raised her eyes and looked at Daphne steadily. \"First, I should tell you about the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNight World. Look, even before you met those vampires, didn\u0027t you ever have the feeling that there was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomething eerie going on, right alongside our world and all mixed up in it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made it as simple as she could, and tried to answer Daphne\u0027s questions patiently. And at last,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne sat back, looking sick and more frightened than Rashel had seen her yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re all over,\" Daphne said, as if she still didn\u0027t believe it. \"In the police departments. In the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egovernment. And nobody\u0027s ever been able to do anything about them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The only people who\u0027ve had any success are the ones who work secretly, in small groups or alone. We\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estay hidden. We\u0027re very careful. And we weed them out, one by one. That\u0027s what it means to be a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evampire hunter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned forward. \"Now do you see why it\u0027s so important for me to get to that enclave? It\u0027s a chance\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto get at a whole bunch of them all at once, to wipe out one of their hiding places. Not to mention\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estopping the slave trade. Don\u0027t you think it should be stopped?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne opened her mouth, shut it again. \"Okay,\" she said finally, and sighed. \"I\u0027ll help. I can tell you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhat to talk about, how to act. At least what worked for me.\" She cocked her head. \"You\u0027re going to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave to dress differently....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get a couple of other vampire hunters and we\u0027ll meet tomorrow after school. Let\u0027s say six-thirty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, I\u0027m taking you home. You need to sleep.\" She waited to see if Daphne would object, but the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eother girl just nodded and sighed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. You know, after some of the things I\u0027ve learned, home\u0027s starting to look good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just one more thing,\" Rashel said. \"You can\u0027t tell anybody about what happened to you. Tell them\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanything-that you ran away, whatever-but not the truth. Okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And especially don\u0027t tell anyone about me. Got it? My life may depend on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elliot\u0027s not here.\" The voice on the telephone was cold and as hostile as Rashel had ever heard it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vicky, I need to talk to him. Or somebody. I\u0027m telling you, this is our chance to get to an enclave. The\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egirl from the warehouse heard them talking about it.\" It was Friday afternoon and Rashel was phoning\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efrom a booth near her school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicky was speaking heavily. \"We staked out that street for days and didn\u0027t see anything, but you just\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehappened to be in the right place at the right time to help a girl escape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I already told you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that was convenient, wasn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel gripped the handset more tightly. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just that it would be a very dangerous thing, going to a vampire enclave. And that a person would have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto really trust whoever was giving them the information about it. You\u0027d have to be sure it wasn\u0027t a trap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel stared at the phone buttons, controlling her breathing. \"I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, well, you don\u0027t have much credibility around here anymore. Not since letting that vampire get\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eaway. And this sounds like just the sort of thing you\u0027d do if you were in on it with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat, Rashel thought. I\u0027ve managed to convince her that I really am a vampire sympathizer. Aloud she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esaid, \"Is that what Nyala is telling everybody? That I\u0027m working with the Night World?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what Nyala is doing.\" Vicky sounded waspish and a little uneasy. \"I haven\u0027t seen her since\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTuesday and nobody answers at her house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel tried to make her voice calm and reasonable. \"Will you at least tell Elliot what I\u0027m doing? Then he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecan call me if he wants to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t hold your breath,\" Vicky said, and hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat. Terrific. Rashel replaced the handset wondering if she wasn\u0027t supposed to hold her breath until\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElliot called, or until Vicky passed on the message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing was clear: she couldn\u0027t count on any help from the Lancers. Or any other vampire hunters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNyala could be spreading any kind of rumors, and Rashel didn\u0027t dare even call another group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no choice. She\u0027d have to do it alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night she went to Daphne\u0027s house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, she\u0027s grounded,\" Mrs. Childs said at the door. She was a small woman with a baby in one hand, a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePampers in the other, and a toddler clutching her leg. \"But I guess you can go upstairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpstairs, Daphne had to chase a younger sister out of the bedroom before Rashel could sit down. \"You\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esee, I don\u0027t even have a room of my own,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re grounded. But you\u0027re alive,\" Rashel said, and raised her eyebrows. \"Hi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Hi.\" Daphne looked embarrassed. Then she smiled, sitting cross-legged on her bed. \"You\u0027re\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewearing normal clothes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel glanced down at her sweater and jeans. \"Yeah, the ninja outfit\u0027s just my career uniform.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne grinned. \"Well, you\u0027re still going to have to look different if you\u0027re going to get into the club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould we start now, or do you want to wait for the others?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel stared at a row of perfume bottles on the dresser across the room. \"There aren\u0027t going to be any\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eothers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I thought you said...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look. It\u0027s hard to explain, but I\u0027ve had a little problem with the vampire hunters around here. So I\u0027m\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edoing it without them. It\u0027s no problem. We can start now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...\" Daphne pursed her lips. She looked different from the disheveled wild creature Rashel had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erescued from the street last night. Her blond hair was soft and fluffy, her cornflower blue eyes were large\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand innocent, her face was round and sweet. She was fashionably dressed and she seemed relaxed, in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher own element in this normal teenager\u0027s room. It was Rashel who felt out of place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well... do you want to just take along a friend or something?\" Daphne asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have a friend,\" Rashel said flatly. \"And\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t want one. Friends are people to worry about, they\u0027re baggage. I don\u0027t like baggage.\" Daphne\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eblinked slowly. \"But at school...\" \"I don\u0027t stay at schools more than one year at a time. I live with foster\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efamilies, and I usually get myself sent to a new city every year. That way I stay ahead of the vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook, this isn\u0027t about me, okay? What I want to know-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But...\" Daphne was staring at the mirror. Rashel followed her gaze to see that the reflecting surface\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas almost completely covered by pictures. Pictures of Daphne with guys, Daphne with other girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne counted her friends in droves, apparently. \"But doesn\u0027t that get lonely?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it doesn\u0027t get lonely,\" Rashel said through her teeth. She found herself getting rough with the lacy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elittle throw pillow on her lap. \"I like being on my own. Now are we done with the press conference?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking hurt, Daphne nodded. \"Okay. I talked with some people at school and everything at the dub is\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egoing on the same as usual-except that Quinn hasn\u0027t been there since Sunday. Ivan and the girl were there\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTuesday and Wednesday, but not Quinn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, really?\" That was interesting. Rashel had known from the beginning that her greatest problem was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egoing to be Quinn. The other two vampires hadn\u0027t seen her-she didn\u0027t think they even realized that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne had run off with a vampire hunter last night. But Quinn had spoken to her. Had been... very\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eclose to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, what could he have seen in that cellar, even with his vampire vision? Not her face. Not even her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehair. Her ninja outfit covered her from neck to wrist to ankle. All he could possibly know was that she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas tall. If she changed her voice and kept her eyes down, he shouldn\u0027t be able to recognize her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it would be easier still if he weren\u0027t there in the first place, and Rashel could try her act on Ivan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That reminds me,\" she said. \"Ivan and the girl- are their little groups into death, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne nodded. \"Everybody in the whole place is, basically. It\u0027s that kind of place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA perfect place for vampires, in other words. Rashel wondered briefly if the Night People owned the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edub or if some obliging humans had just constructed the ideal habitat for them. She\u0027d have to check into\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually,\" Daphne was saying, a little shyly, \"I\u0027ve got a poem here for you. I thought you could say you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewrote it. It would sort of prove you were into the same thing as the other girls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel took the piece of notebook paper and read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s warmth in ice; there\u0027s cooling peace in fire,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd midnight light to show us all the way. The dancing flame becomes a funeral pyre; The Dark was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emore enticing than the Day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at Daphne sharply. \"You wrote this before you knew about the Night World?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne nodded. \"It\u0027s the kind of thing Quinn liked. He used to say he was the darkness and the silence\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand things like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel wished she had Quinn right there in the room, along with a large stake. These young girls were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elike moths to his flame, and he was taking advantage of their innocence. He wasn\u0027t even pretending to be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eharmless; instead he was encouraging them to love their own destruction. Making them think it was their\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About your clothes,\" Daphne was going on. \"My friend Mamie is about your size and she lent me this\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estuff. Try it on and we\u0027ll see if it looks right.\" She tossed Rashel a bundle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel unfolded it, examined it doubtfully. A few minutes later she was examining herself even more\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edoubtfully in the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was wearing a velvety black jumpsuit which clung to her like a second skin. It was cut in a very low\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eV in front, but the sleeves reached down in Gothic points on the backs of her hands almost to the middle\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efinger. Around her neck was a black leather choker that looked to her like a dog collar. She said, \"I don\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknow...\" \"No, no, you look great. Sort of like a Betsey Johnson ultra model. Walk a little... turn\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003earound... okay, yeah. Now all we have to do is paint your fingernails black, add a little makeup, and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne stopped and frowned. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" \"It\u0027s the way you walk. You walk like-well, like\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethem, actually. Like the vampires. As if you\u0027re stalking something. And you don\u0027t ever make a noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re going to know you\u0027re a vampire hunter from the way you move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a good point, but Rashel didn\u0027t know what to do about it. \"Um...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got it,\" Daphne said brightly. \"We\u0027ll put you in heels.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no,\" Rashel said. \"There is absolutely no way I\u0027m going to wear those things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027ll be perfect, see? You won\u0027t be able to walk normally.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, and I won\u0027t be able to run, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you aren\u0027t going there to run. You\u0027re going to talk and dance and stuff.\" Hands on her hips, she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshook her head. \"I don\u0027t know, Rashel, you really need somebody to go there with you, to help you with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethis stuff....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaphne stopped and her eyes narrowed. She stared at the mirror for a moment, then she nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. That\u0027s it. There\u0027s no other choice,\" she said, expelling her breath. She turned to face Rashel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esquarely. \"I\u0027ll just have to go with you myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need somebody with you; you can\u0027t do this all alone. And there\u0027s nobody better than me. I\u0027ll go\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith you and this time we\u0027ll both get chosen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel sat on the bed. \"I\u0027m sorry; this time you \u0027re crazy. You\u0027re the last person the vampires would ever\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echoose. You know all about them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But they don\u0027t know that,\" Daphne said serenely. \"I told everybody at school today that I didn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eremember anything that happened from Sunday on. I had to tell them something, you know. So I said\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat I never got to meet Quinn; that I didn\u0027t know what happened to me, but I woke up last night alone\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon this street in Mission Hill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel tried to think. Would any of the vampires believe this story?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer surprised her. They just might. If Daphne had begun to come out of the mind control while\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe was in the truck... if she had jumped out and started running, only to become fully conscious a little\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhile later.. .. Yes. It could work. The vampires would assume that she\u0027d have amnesia for the whole\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eperiod she was in a trance, and maybe for a little before. It could work....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s too dangerous,\" she said. \"Even if I let you go to the club with me, I could never let you get\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echosen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? You already said I must be resistant to their mind-control thingy, right?\" Daphne\u0027s blue eyes\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere sparking with energy and her cheeks were flushed. \"So that makes me perfect for the job. I can do\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eit. I know I can help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel stood helplessly. Take this fluffy bunny of a girl to a vampire enclave? Let her get sold as a slave\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto bloodsucking monsters? Ask her to fight ruthless snakes like Quinn? \"I like to work alone,\" she said in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea hard voice. Daphne folded her arms over her chest, refusing to be intimidated. \"Well, maybe it\u0027s time\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou tried something different. Look, I\u0027ve never met anyone like you. You\u0027re so independent, so\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eadventurous, so--amazing. But even you can\u0027t do everything by yourself. I know I\u0027m not a vampire\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehunter, but I\u0027d like to be your friend. Maybe you should try trusting a friend this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes met Rashel\u0027s, and at that moment she didn\u0027t look like a fluffy bunny, but like a small, confident,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand intelligent young woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides, it was me who got kidnapped,\" Daphne said, shrugging. \"Don\u0027t you think I should get to pay\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethem back a little?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel caught herself almost grinning. She couldn\u0027t help liking this girl, or feeling a glow of warmth at her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epraise. But still... She drew in a careful breath and watched Daphne closely. \"And you\u0027re not scared?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I\u0027m scared. I\u0027d be stupid not to be. But I\u0027m not so scared I can\u0027t go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the right answer. Rashel looked around the cluttered lacy room and nodded slowly. At last she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esaid, \"Okay, you\u0027re in. Tomorrow\u0027s Saturday. We\u0027ll do it tomorrow night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-the-chosen-night-world-5/page-8.html","bookId":2079,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:52 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:52 PM"}
