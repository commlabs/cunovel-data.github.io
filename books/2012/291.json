The flash of blazing eyes. Wings snapping out like galley sails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the dragon at the centre then rose into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all end somewhere .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all end here .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the centre ranks rose up to collide with the Liosan front line, Yedan Derryg, with Sergeant Cellows at his side, pushed forward. Five lines between him and that veering dragon. His only obstacle. But these were the elites, heavily armoured, perfectly disciplined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw the other two Soletaken, one on each side, but there was nothing he could do about them. Not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hust sword howled as he slammed into the front line. The blade was gorged on draconic blood. It had drunk deep the red wine of Hounds’ blood. It had bathed in the life-ends of a thousand Liosan soldiers. Now it shook off the chains of constraint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo swiftly did it slash that Yedan almost lost his grip. He grunted to see the soldier before him cut through, shield, sword, chain, flesh and bone, diagonally down his torso, gore exploding out to the sides. A back swing split open the chests of the man to either side. Like a cestus, Yedan and the soldiers closest to him drove into the Liosan ranks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hust sword spun, lashed out in blurs, blood sprayed. Yedan was tugged after it, stumbling, at times almost lifted from his feet as the weapon shrieked its glee, slaughtering all that dared stand before it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll at once, there was no one between him and the Soletaken. The wreaths of white fire were pouring off the shining scales, the solid bulk of the dragon rising to fill Yedan Derryg’s vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShit. Miscalculated. It’s going to get clear. Sister – I’m sorry. I’m too late .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe head lunged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leapt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sword sank deep into the dragon’s chest. The creature roared in shock and pain, and then the wings hammered at its sides, scattering Liosan and Shake alike, and the Soletaken lifted into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanging from his sword, Yedan scrambled, fought his way on to the dragon’s shoulders. He tore his weapon free. Cut two-handed into its neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty reaches above the melee, the creature pitched, canted hard and slammed into Lightfall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe concussion thundered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYedan Derryg slid down over the dragon’s right shoulder, down between it and Lightfall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon’s neck bowed and the jaws plunged down to engulf him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they closed, the Hust sword burst from the top of the dragon’s snout. Wings smashing the wall of light, the giant reptile reared its head back, Yedan tumbling free, still gripping the sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was caught by the talons of the Soletaken’s left foot, the massive claws convulsively clenching. Blood sprayed from the body it held.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain the dragon careered into Lightfall, and this time a wing collapsed under the impact. Twisting, pitching head first, the creature slid downward. Slammed into the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYedan Derryg was thrown clear, his body a shattered mess, and where he fell, he did not move. At his side, the Hust sword howled its rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe journey through the forest by Rake’s last three Soletaken – Korlat, Prazek Goul and Dathenar Fandoris – had been as savage as fighting a riptide. Silanah was among the most ancient of all living Eleint. Her will tore at them, drove them to their knees again and again. Silanah called upon them, called them by name, sought her own summoning. Still, they managed to resist, but Korlat knew that to shift into draconic form would simply make it worse, the blood of the Eleint awakening in each of them, chaos unfurling in their souls like the deadliest flower. At the same time, she knew that there were Soletaken at the First Shore. She could feel them. And what could the Shake do against such creatures?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly die .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Liosan Soletaken would be able to resist Silanah – at least for a time – or perhaps indeed they could even defy her, if their own Storm, when it broke upon this world, was strong enough. And she feared it would be. This is not the taste of one or two Soletaken. No – gods, how many are there?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Korlat!’ gasped Dathenar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I know. But we have no choice, do we?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrazek spat behind her and said. ‘Better to die in Kharkanas than anywhere else.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKorlat agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they reached the rise, they saw a frenzied battle at the wound in Lightfall, and the Liosan soldiers now pouring from that breach vastly outnumbered the defenders. They saw a man do battle with a dragon rising skyward. Saw two Liosan warriors veering to join their winged kin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey did not hesitate. Darkness bloomed, erupted like black smoke under water, and three black dragons rose above the strand. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-291.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
