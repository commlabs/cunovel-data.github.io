I might have it copyrighted!\" she shrugged.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But she told the chauffeur to hurry, hoping that she might, even yet, get to the office before Daniel got there.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If I don\u0027t, and if he tries to keep Catherine from coming down to me—well, if I didn\u0027t look such a sight, I would go right up into the office!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When, however, the taxicab drew up before the building of which the second floor was occupied by Daniel\u0027s law offices, and she leaned for an instant out of the cab window, she saw her husband coming down the street. Jennie, then, had been too early for him. Margaret looked about hastily for Catherine, but she saw nothing of her. She shrank far back, then, in the cab to prevent Daniel\u0027s seeing her, for he was now close by.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She saw him hesitate at the door of the building and glance inquiringly at the cab; then, curiosity moving him, for Daniel had the petty curiosity of an unoccupied woman, he came over to the curb and looked into the window of the cab.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Margaret met his glance calmly. All she cared about was that he should not prevent her meeting Catherine.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why, Margaret! You out of doors! What for? You came for me? Is anything wrong?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I came out for some fresh air.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But to come out on the street!\" he protested, scandalized.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m not exposed to view.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But the chauffeur has seen you!\" whispered Daniel, actually colouring with embarrassment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He doesn\u0027t mind it nearly as much as you do, Daniel. I think he\u0027ll recover; he looks robust.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But what have you come down to my office for?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As Margaret at this moment saw Catherine coming out of the building, she promptly answered, \"To see Miss Hamilton and clear matters up with her. Here she is now.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daniel turned about sharply, and Catherine, nodding a cheerful good-morning to him, stepped into the cab and bent over Margaret to kiss her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But, Miss Hamilton,\" cried Daniel as his clerk settled Herself comfortably beside his wife, \"why are you not at your desk?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I left a note on your desk, Mr. Leitzel, asking you to excuse me for an hour. I shall be back before ten,\" she replied, drawing the cab door shut and speaking to him through the open window.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To the park,\" Margaret ordered the chauffeur. \"Good-bye, Daniel.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Miss Hamilton,\" faltered Daniel, but before he could collect his wits to decide how he ought to meet so unprecedented a situation, the car started and whirled down the street.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Slowly and thoughtfully he turned into his office building. Never before in all his life had his will been so frustrated as by this young wife of his hearth and home upon whom he showered every comfort, every luxury and indulgence. That any one whom he supported should disobey, defy, and thwart him! It was beyond belief. How did she dare to do it?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But what\u0027s a man to do with a wife who doesn\u0027t care for his displeasure any more than if he were an old cat!\" he raged. \"Oh, well,\" he tried to console himself, \"it won\u0027t be long, now, until the baby comes, and then surely she\u0027ll be different. She\u0027ll have to be! I\u0027ll find some means of teaching her that my wishes can\u0027t be disregarded!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Hamilton\u0027s note which he found on his desk stated succinctly that she had an imperative engagement this morning which would make her an hour late.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Daniel, sinking limply into his desk-chair, crushed the note in his long, thin fingers and tossed it into his waste-basket, with the murderous wish that it was his clerk\u0027s head he was smashing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What will they be when they get the vote?\" he groaned. \"Women,\" he said spitefully but epigrammatically, \"are the pest of men\u0027s lives!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Margaret, meantime, without once directly referring to her husband and his sisters, had managed to convey to Catherine an explanation of the silence and desolation that had existed between them during the past two weeks; and she was now making a compact with her which she felt must insure them both against any future misunderstanding.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Tell me first, Catherine, that our friendship means more to you than—than any petty considerations! Please, Catherine, tell me that it does! For I just must have you, you know! You are more to me than I can possibly be to you, for you have your mother, while I——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She hesitated and Catherine said, \"And you, Margaret, will soon have your child. Will that make you need me any less? I don\u0027t believe it will, dear. And my other dear ones can\u0027t in the least fill your place in my life. I can\u0027t give you up any more than you can spare me. Nothing,\" she said with decision, \"shall separate us.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then,\" said Margaret, pressing Catherine\u0027s hand, \"hereafter, when you come to see me, ring the bell four times by twos, and I, knowing about the hour to look for you, will be on hand to let you in myself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"All right. I will.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Catherine! You are large-minded!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"My dear!\" protested Catherine, \"\u0027large-minded\u0027 to be indifferent to the eccentricities of—well,\" she closed her lips on the rest of her sentence, \"two illiterate, vulgar old women,\" was what she had nearly said; but she left it to Margaret\u0027s imagination to finish her remark.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"While you are ill in bed, I suppose I shan\u0027t be able to get near you,\" she ventured. \"It will be dreadful if I have to wait nearly a month before I can see that baby! It\u0027s going to be awfully dear to me, Margaret! Next thing to having one of my own.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I couldn\u0027t wait a whole month to show it to you. I\u0027ll ask the doctor to bring you to me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We\u0027ll manage somehow,\" affirmed Catherine.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Margaret, looking rather pale, did not answer, and Catherine suddenly put her arms about her and kissed her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You poor child!\" she said tenderly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m not a good fighter,\" Margaret sadly shook her head. \"And there are so many, many adjustments to be made, I——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She stopped short and bit her lips to keep back the tears that sprang to her eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"At least,\" said Catherine encouragingly, \"you seem to be coming to your ordeal, dear, with plenty of courage; and that\u0027s the main thing just now.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, Catherine, I\u0027m willing to go through a lot for the sake of holding a baby of my own to my heart!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Then you think, Margaret, that motherhood is going to be all that it\u0027s cracked up to be?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Under ideal conditions,\" said Margaret, \"I can see nothing greater to be desired.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But do the ideal conditions ever exist?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I suppose they seldom do.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sometimes I\u0027ve had my doubts,\" said Catherine. \"The male poets and painters exalt the beauty, the holiness of motherhood, and the women bear the burden and pain of it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But when women whose lives have had the largest horizon—women like Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Margaret Fuller—have declared that their motherhood was the crown and climax of all their experiences of life, I suppose the poets and painters are not very wrong about it, Catherine.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I hope they are not, since all my instincts about it are entirely primitive and I feel that nothing in the world will compensate me if I\u0027ve got to go through life childless.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There would be one compensation,\" said Margaret earnestly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sometimes, since I\u0027ve known I was going to have a child, the responsibility, the almost crushing responsibility, has seemed more than I could bear. That\u0027s what I meant when I spoke of ideal conditions.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Catherine held back her mental reply to this, which was, \"Yes, we should be careful whom we marry, and why did you tie up with a little rat like Danny Leitzel?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What she did say was: \"You didn\u0027t feel this crushing sense of responsibility until after you found yourself pregnant?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No. Before that I thought only of my own happiness in having a baby to cherish. But, Catherine, when we look about us and see what life can do to us, I wonder how we ever dare, under any conditions, to bring a child into this awful world!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We can\u0027t question the foundations of the universe, however.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, but we can question modern civilization, which produces a huge population of criminals, lunatics, degenerates, and incapables.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Think of pleasant things, my dear!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I try to. To tell you the truth, in spite of my heavy sense of responsibility, I can hardly wait, Catherine, until I have my baby! I want to show you the lovely little embroidered dress Harriet sent me. Will you come in to see it and me this afternoon after four o\u0027clock?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll be on the watch.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"All right,\" Catherine nodded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The baby received another present, the other day, which touched me very much,\" added Margaret. \"A cunning pair of socks from its grandmother which she knit herself.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Its grandmother? But——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I mean Mr. Leitzel\u0027s step-mother.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did you ever happen to see her, Catherine?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Once. She came to the office once to see Mr. Leitzel.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Catherine\u0027s tone of withdrawal, as though she feared to be questioned, piqued Margaret\u0027s interest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What was your impression of her?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Margaret, your husband\u0027s mother has an unforgettable face! There\u0027s a benediction in it, such sweetness, refinement, and simplicity shine in her countenance. When she had talked to me for a while, I felt as a good Catholic must who has been blessed by the Pope. Just the sort of person (with a heart too tender to hurt a fly) to be herself easily victimized by the human vultures that prey upon the too confiding.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Has anybody victimized her?\" Margaret casually inquired.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Catherine hesitated an instant before she answered: \"Righteousness is sometimes a breastplate to protect the otherwise defenceless. It is that dear old woman\u0027s extraordinary conscientiousness that has saved her from being entirely devoured by the vultures, though she has certainly been gnawed at pretty hard. I can\u0027t explain to you, now, just what I mean. Some day, perhaps.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, do tell me, Catherine.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Again Catherine hesitated before she replied: \"She made a certain promise to her husband on his deathbed which her conscience has never allowed her to break, though she has always believed that she was acting against her own interests in keeping it. But it\u0027s her loyalty to her promise that\u0027s been her breastplate; that has saved her from the vultures.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Margaret considered in silence this suggestive bit of information. It was rather more lucid to her than Catherine suspected. But she was impressed with the sudden realization she had of her friend\u0027s intimate knowledge of Daniel\u0027s affairs and it flashed upon her that perhaps his seemingly unreasonable objections to their intimacy might have quite another explanation than that he had given it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In this, however, she was mistaken. Daniel entirely trusted the discretion of his clerk. Not so much because he believed her bound in honour to keep his secrets as because it was the part of a first-class clerk (which she was) to be discreetly silent as to her employer\u0027s business operations.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And now, my dear,\" Catherine broke in on her thoughts, \"since we\u0027ve threshed things out and have made a compact that we will not again misunderstand each other, I think I\u0027d better get back to my \u0027job.\u0027\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Margaret gave the order to the chauffeur; and when a little while later, alone in the taxicab on her way home, she found her heart overflowing with a sense of the fulness, the richness of life, and considered how strenuously Daniel and his sisters tried to take from her the comfort, the happiness, of companionship with Catherine and how impossible it would be to make them see what that companionship meant to her, she felt greatly strengthened in her resolve to resist, steadily and persistently, their aggressions upon her personal liberty.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At her own door, as she opened her purse to pay for the cab, she found she had remaining of her monthly allowance only two dollars and the chauffeur\u0027s price was three dollars. She hesitated an instant, then telling the man to charge the cab to Mr. Leitzel, she got out hastily and went indoors.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Rather hard on Daniel to make him pay the costs of my plots gotten up to circumvent his plots! He won\u0027t like it. Ah, I\u0027ve a bright idea! I\u0027ll tell him to deduct the three dollars from my next \u0027allowance.\u0027 That will appease him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But on second thoughts she realized that that same bright idea would surely occur to Daniel without any suggestion from her. \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1853/53679.html","bookId":968,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 6:15:50 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 6:15:50 AM"}
