And Tom, well, he hunts them, you know, and… \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s going to kill him or destroy him or whatever it is he does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Why? Antonio hasn\u0027t done anything to anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vicki, read my lips. He\u0027s a vampire. They kill people and drink their blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Vicki looked over at the booth where Antonio was sitting. In spite of what she had just said, she couldn\u0027t dismiss the truth of Bobbie Sue\u0027s words. Hadn\u0027t Antonio himself told her just that night that he drank blood? Where else was he going to get it, if not from… from people he killed? So he wasn\u0027t responsible for killing Sharlene and the others. That didn\u0027t mean he hadn\u0027t killed others, only that he hadn\u0027t been caught.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was all she could think about during the remainder of her shift. She served platters of steak and shrimp and bowls of soup and all she could think about was Antonio and how many people he must have killed to survive as long as he had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was waiting for her outside when the diner closed. Without a word, he walked her to her car, waited while she unlocked the door and got behind the wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get in,\" she said. \"We need to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ride home seemed longer than usual. His presence in the car was almost overwhelming. Never had she been so aware of how very male he was. He exuded strength and power and a sense of invincibility that was both reassuring and frightening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she pulled into the driveway, he got out of the car first. As he had before, he scanned the yard and the trees beyond before he opened the door for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the house, she closed and locked the front door, then went into the living room and sat down. He followed her, still silent. He didn\u0027t sit down, simply stood there, waiting, as if he knew what was coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You drink blood,\" she said. \"Where do you get it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grunted softly. \"What you want to know is how many people I have killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAntonio paced the length of the room, then came to stand in front of her once again. \"I am not like Dimitri Falco. I do not kill for pleasure. I have killed in the past. I do not deny it I have killed to preserve my existence. I have killed to defend myself, but never without cause.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you have to kill to live, don\u0027t you? How often? Every night? Once a week?\" Even if he only needed sustenance once a year, he would have killed over six hundred people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no need for me to take life, Victoria. I can take what I need without killing. I have been a vampire for a very long time. My need for blood grows less with each passing year, though my desire for it has not changed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tom Duncan intends to kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBattista lifted one brow. \"Indeed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki nodded. \"Bobbie Sue told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made a sound deep in his throat. It sounded almost like a growl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can he? Kill you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am already dead, but he can destroy me, though he will have to find me first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t find that very comforting. Of course, Duncan hadn\u0027t been able to locate Falco thus far, though she prayed that would soon change. Hopefully, Duncan would never find Antonio\u0027s resting place, wherever that might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you think about what I said last night?\" Battista asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you kidding? I haven\u0027t been able to think of anything else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What have you decided?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you in my life.\" She hadn\u0027t known what her answer was going to be until that moment. Now, hearing the words, they felt right. \"So, I guess we\u0027re going steady.\" Using such an outdated term made her cheeks grow hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Going steady.\" He repeated the words, his tone faintly amused, as he sat down beside her. \"You are sure? You have no doubts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I have a lot of doubts, but I\u0027m not listening to them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas he pleased with her answer, she wondered, or just amused?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned toward her and she knew he was going to kiss her. She put her hand against his chest, staying him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s just one more thing. You\u0027re not planning to drink my blood, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced briefly at her throat. \"Only if you want me to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No worries, then,\" she said, confident that even if she lived to be a hundred, she would never ask him to do anything so inherently repugnant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 20\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki woke with a smile the next morning. She was going steady. With a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA look at the clock showed that it was already past noon. She never slept this late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClutching a pillow to her chest, she laughed out loud. She had only been going steady with Antonio for one night and already her life was changing, but she supposed that was to be expected. After all, it was obvious that if she wanted to spend time with Antonio, she was going to have to adjust her hours to his, since he couldn\u0027t adjust his to hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe diner closed at midnight on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, and at one A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon Friday and Saturday. That meant that she had from closing time until dawn to spend with Antonio on the nights she worked. Sundays and Mondays, when she was off, they would have more time together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFilled with a rush of nervous energy, she dressed and ate a quick breakfast, then cleaned the house from top to bottom, excited at the prospect of seeing him again that evening. If Antonio had been a normal, mortal man, she would have planned an intimate candlelit dinner, baked a seven-layer chocolate cake, bought a bottle of vintage wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that was out of the question. Maybe she could find a bottle of blood somewhere…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grimaced at the thought, only then remembering that he had never really answered her question of where and how he fed. If he didn\u0027t kill to survive, did he just prey on unsuspecting women? She shook her head. If that were the case, the papers would be filled with stories of women who had been preyed upon, and the tabloids would be shrieking that there was a vampire running amok. Maybe there were people who offered to let him drink their blood, people like Goths who were really into the whole vampire scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew she shouldn\u0027t be wondering about such things, but she couldn\u0027t help it. There was so much she didn\u0027t know. Maybe he could give her a list of dos and don\u0027ts for people dating the Undead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughing at the thought, she went into the bathroom to take a shower and get dressed for work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAntonio was waiting for her when she left the house that evening. The surge of pleasure she felt at seeing him again made her knees go weak. It wasn\u0027t fair for him to have such a devastating effect on her senses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled as she hurried down the stairs. \"Hi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed out loud. \"What? No \u0027good evening\u0027 a la Dracula?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought I would try to make my speech more contemporary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heartbeat ramped into overdrive as he bent his head to kiss her. When he would have let her go, she wrapped her arms around his neck and deepened the kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis body responded instantly and before she knew what was happening, he had her backed up against the porch, his body pressed intimately against hers as his hands began a slow exploration of her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat quickly, she was on fire for him. Feeling as though she could never be close enough, she pressed herself against him. A soft moan rose in her throat as she ground her hips against his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLifting his head, he looked deep into her eyes. \" Victoria … \" Her name was a low groan on his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow?\" He arched one brow, his dark eyes alight with amusement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a good thing she had to go to work, she thought. It was the only thing that kept her from taking him by the hand and leading him back into the house and up the stairs into her bedroom. And into her bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we can take up where we left off later?\" she suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would be my pleasure to do so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was smiling again. \"And mine.\" She handed him the keys to her car. \"Why don\u0027t you drive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you wish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver the gentleman, he opened the door for her, then got into the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki sat back in her seat, content to do nothing more than look at him. Every time he glanced her way, her insides turned to mush. She had never felt this way about a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt amazed her that she felt so strongly about him after only a few weeks. In some ways, she felt as if she had known him forever. Forever, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would live forever, while she would not. She shook the depressing thought from her mind. She wouldn\u0027t think about that now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced over at her. \"Is something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing he had noticed her staring at him brought a rush of heat to her face. \"No, why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I find you very attractive also.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel you still have questions you would like to ask me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, maybe one or two. Like, why do always wear black and… Well, you never did tell me how you satisfy your hunger or your thirst or whatever you call it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I feel the urge to feed, I call someone to me and take what I need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean you hypnotize them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. And when I have satisfied the craving, I wipe the memory from their mind. As for wearing black… It blends with the night.\" He looked at her and grinned. \"And it looks good on me.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/desire-after-dark-vampire-trilogy-3/page-23.html","bookId":2298,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:03:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:03:24 PM"}
