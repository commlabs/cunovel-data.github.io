Even you mentioned how the ancient Khmer probably stumbled upon the glowing cavern and attributed it to some god\u0027s home. Maybe Vishnu\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor stared at the commander. \"Or maybe Susan was a glimpse of that greater mystery, a peek at the godlike or angelic potential hidden inside all of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray finally shrugged, plainly ready to dismiss it. But as Vigor had hoped, he noted a slight pinch to the man\u0027s brows. Curiosity. He wanted Gray to keep his mind open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, Vigor also saw that something more urgently pressed upon the man\u0027s mind and attention. He waved Gray out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor called to him as he stepped out the door. \"Give my best to Seichan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray stumbled a step, frowned a bit, and headed away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVigor replaced his reading glasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, sweet youth . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e12:20 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray handed the cup of coffee to the guard outside Seichan\u0027s door. \"Is she awake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, a young sandy-haired ensign from Peoria. \"Don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray pushed through the door. It was a dull assignment for the ensign. The patient was almost continuously sedated after going through a second operation for her gunshot wound. Seichan had retorn her injury and had been bleeding internally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll because she had saved Gray\u0027s life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered Seichan\u0027s arms carrying him, the pain in her blistered face, her swollen eye. But he hadn\u0027t known that by coming back for him she had almost died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray entered her room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lay handcuffed to her bed, arms spread to either side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wore a hospital gown and was covered with a clean sheet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room, built for mental patients, was sterile and cold. The only furniture was the bed and a rolling stand shoved against the wall. A high, narrow window had steel shutters over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan stirred as he entered. She turned her head. Her face hardened with a slight downcast to her eyes, ashamed at her immobilization. Then anger flared up and burned all else away. She tugged at one of her handcuffed wrists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray came and sat on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even though my parents are alive,\" he started right in, \"that doesn\u0027t mean I forgive you. That I\u0027ll ever forgive you. But I do owe you. I won\u0027t let you die. Not this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray pulled the handcuff keys from his pocket. He reached out and lifted her wrist. He felt her pulse quicken under his fingertips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re sending you to Guantanamo Bay in the morning,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"1 know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd like Gray, she also knew it was a death sentence. If she wasn\u0027t immediately executed, the Guild would assassinate her to silence her, or one of the other intelligence agencies would. The Israeli Mossad still had an open kill order on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slipped in the key and turned the lock. Her cuff snapped open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan sat up, still wearing a glint of suspicion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held out her palm for the key, testing him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave it to her. As she undid her second cuff, Gray placed the package Kowalski had obtained on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have three sets of clothes: a nurse\u0027s uniform, local attire, and something in camouflage. There\u0027s also local currency. I couldn\u0027t do anything about ID, not on this short notice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan\u0027s other handcuff snapped free. Turning, she rubbed her wrists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soft sound of a body hitting the floor sounded past the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, and I drugged the guard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced to the door, then back to him. Her eyes sparked. Before he could move, she lunged, grabbed his collar, and pulled him to her. She kissed him hard, her mouth parting, tasting sweetly medicinal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray instinctively pulled back. He hadn\u0027t come here to—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, screw it. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached to the small of her back and cupped her tightly to him. Never releasing, she climbed into him, onto him, over him. Her feet lowered to the floor. He twisted, falling back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard the snick of shackles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed off of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis right wrist had been handcuffed to the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced up in time to see her elbow swinging toward his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head cracked back. He tasted blood on his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaped on him, pinning him to the bed, sitting on his chest. She raised her fist. He lifted his free arm to block. She cocked her head. \"This has to look convincing, or you\u0027ll be the one sitting in Guantanamo for treason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray lowered his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe struck him hard, splitting his lip. His head rang with the blow. She shook the sting from her hand—then raised her fist again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And this is for not trusting me,\" she said, and lashed out again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood spurted from his nose. He felt himself drift away, then back again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned down, near his ear. \"Do you remember that little promise I made to you at the very beginning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\" He turned to the side and spat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That I\u0027d reveal the mole to you after this was all over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there was no mole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you certain of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes hovered over his. Suddenly he wasn\u0027t so sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat back and whipped out with her elbow, a glancing blow to his eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027ll swell fine.\" She rubbed her lips, studying him, like an artist over an oil painting in progress. Then said, \"I\u0027m the mole, Gray.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What—?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A mole planted inside the Guild.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slammed a fist into his other eye. His vision went black for a breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m one of the good guys, Gray. Haven\u0027t you figured that out yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray lay there dazed, from her words, from her blows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A double agent?\" he coughed out, incredulous. \"Two years ago, you shot me! Point-blank in the chest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cocked her fist again. \"I knew you had on liquid body armor. Didn\u0027t you ever wonder why I was wearing the same? Catch a clue, Gray.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fist hammered down, rocking his head back. She then pinched the bridge of his nose, plainly wondering if she should break it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the anthrax bomb,\" he said. \"At Fort Detrick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Already sterilized. A dud. I was planning on blaming the bomb\u0027s designer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But... the curator in Venice?\" he sputtered out. \"You killed him in cold blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slashed her fingernails down his left cheek, digging deep furrows of fire. \"If I hadn\u0027t, his whole family would have been slaughtered. Including wife and daughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWincing, Gray stared up. She had an answer for everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan leaned back, cranking the heel of her hand up to her ear, eyeing his nose. \"And I\u0027m not stopping... not after five years, not when I\u0027m this damn close to discovering who leads the Guild.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe punched down, but he caught her wrist this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned her weight, pressing down on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seichan. . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared down at him, muscles straining, eyes fiery, as if in pain. Their eyes met. She searched his face, looking for something. She didn\u0027t seem to find it. For a flash, he saw disappointment in her eyes. Also regret. . . maybe loneliness. Then it was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slammed him with her other elbow, a blow to the ear, scattering stars across his vision. He released her. She fell back, scrambling off of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027ll do,\" she mumbled, turning away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crossed to the clothes, shed her hospital gown, and quickly donned the nurse\u0027s uniform, including a demure silk scarf to hide her healing face. She kept her back to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seichan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce dressed, she didn\u0027t say a word, only stepped to the door. She wouldn\u0027t even turn, only asked one last thing of him, spoken softly, a lifeline thrown back toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust me, Gray. If only a little. I\u0027ve earned that much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he could answer, she left. The door swung closed behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrust me. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeaven help him, he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shoved up in the bed, his face throbbing, his one eye swelling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifteen minutes passed. Long enough to ensure that she escaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally Painter appeared at the door, pushing inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you get all that?\" Gray asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The wire picked up everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could she be telling the truth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter frowned, staring back at the door. \"She is a consummate liar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe she had to be. To survive inside the Guild.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter undid the handcuffs. \"Either way, the passive tracer we planted in her belly during the operation will allow us to track her whereabouts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what if the Guild finds it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a plastic polymer, invisible to X-ray. They\u0027ll never detect it.\" Unless they cut her open. Gray stood up. \"This is wrong. You know it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was the only way the government would allow us to free her.\" Gray remembered Seichan\u0027s eyes, staring down at him. He knew two truths. She had not been lying. And even now, she was certainly far from free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEpilogue\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAugust 11, 8:32 a .m. Takoma Park, Maryland\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The restoration job looks great,\" Gray said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father slid a cloth moist with Turtle Wax over the hood of the Thunderbird. They had rescued the convertible out of impound, towing it away on a flatbed. Painter had arranged to have the T-bird repaired at the best classic restoration shop in the D.C. area. His father had gotten it back last week, but this was the first time Gray had seen it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father stepped back, hands on his hips. He wore an oil-stained undershirt and long shorts, showing off his new leg, another courtesy of Sigma, DARPA-designed, exceptionally realistic. But it wasn\u0027t the leg that concerned his father at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gray, what do you think of these new rims? Not as nice as my old Kelsey wire wheels.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray came around to stand next to his dad. They looked the same to him. \"You\u0027re right,\" he said anyway. \"These suck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm,\" his father said noncommittally. \"But they were free. That Painter fellow was pretty generous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray could get a sense of where this was leading. \"Dad . . .\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-judas-strain-sigma-force-4/page-83.html","bookId":1529,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:39:28 PM"}
