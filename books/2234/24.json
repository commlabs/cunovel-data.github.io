Her foreign minister, Kamil Revin, was also there, sitting to one side. Protocol demanded his presence. The American introduced himself as Edwin Davis and produced a letter from the president of the United States that attested to his credentials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I may, Minister,\" Davis said in a light tone, \"could we speak in private?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was puzzled. \"Anything you would tell me, I would pass on to Kamil anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt you would pass on what we\u0027ll be discussing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words came out as a challenge, but the envoy\u0027s facial expression never broke, so she decided to be cautious. \"Leave us,\" she said to Kamil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe younger man hesitated. But after Venice and Karyn, she was not in the mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer foreign minister rose and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you always treat your people like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is not a democracy. Men like Kamil do as told, or-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of your germs will visit their bodies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe should have known that even more people knew her business. But this time it ran straight to Washington. \"I don\u0027t recall your president ever complaining of the peace the Federation has brought to this region. Once this whole area was a problem, now America enjoys the benefits of a friend. And governing here is not a matter of persuasion. It\u0027s about strength.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t misunderstand, Minister. Your methods are not our concern. We agree. Having a friend is worth the occasional\"-Davis hesitated-\"personnel replacement.\" His cold eyes communicated a look of begrudging respect. \"Minister, I\u0027ve come here to personally tell you something. The president did not think the usual diplomatic channels appropriate. This conversation needs to remain between us, as friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat choice did she have? \"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know a woman named Karyn Walde?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer legs tightened as emotions ricocheted through her. But she held her composure and decided to be honest. \"I do. What of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was kidnapped last night. From a house here in Samarkand. She was once your lover, and is currently afflicted with AIDS.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe fought to maintain a dull look. \"You seem to know a lot about my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We like to know all we can about our friends. Unlike you, we live in an open society where all of our secrets are either on television or the Internet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what brought you to delve into mine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does that matter? It\u0027s fortuitous that we did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what do you know about Karyn\u0027s disappearance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A man named Enrico Vincenti took her. She\u0027s being held at his estate, here in the Federation. Land he purchased as part of your deal with the Venetian League.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe message was clear. This man knew many things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m also here to say that Cassiopeia Vitt is not your problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe concealed her surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vincenti. He\u0027s your problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And why is that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll admit that this is just speculation on our part. In most places of the world, nobody would care about your sexual orientation. True, you were once married but, from what we\u0027ve been able to learn, it was for appearances. He died tragically-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He and I never had a cross word. He understood why he was there. I actually liked him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not our concern, and I didn\u0027t mean to insult. But you have remained unmarried since. Karyn Walde worked for you for a time. One of your secretaries. So, I imagine, having a private relationship with her proved easy. No one paid much attention, so long as you were careful. But central Asia is not western Europe.\" Davis reached into his jacket and removed a small recorder. \"Let me play something for you.\" He activated the unit and stood it upright on the table between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it\u0027s good to know your information was accurate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t have bothered you with fantasy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you still haven\u0027t said how you knew someone would try to kill me today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The League watches over its members, and you, Supreme Minister, are one of our most important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re so full of it, Enrico.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavis switched off the recorder. \"You and Vincenti, talking on the phone two days ago. An international call. Easily monitored.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed \"Play\" again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your payment for saving my life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your end of our bargain, as we originally discussed long ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be ready to meet with the Council in a few days. First, there are things I need to resolve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m more interested in when you and I will meet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you are. I am, too, actually. But there are things I must complete.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My time on the Council ends soon. Thereafter, you\u0027ll have others to deal with. They may not be as accommodating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do enjoy dealing with you, Enrico. We so understand each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soon. First, you have that other problem we spoke about. The Americans.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to worry, I plan to deal with that today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavis switched off the machine. \"Vincenti dealt with the problem. He killed one of our agents. We found her body, along with another man, the one who arranged for your assassination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You allowed her to die? Knowing of the conversation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unfortunately, we did not have this recording until after she disappeared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t like the way Davis\u0027 eyes flickered between her and the recorder-along with the strange uneasiness that accompanied her growing anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently, you and Vincenti are engaged in some sort of joint venture. I\u0027m here-again, as your friend-to tell you that he intends to change that deal. Here\u0027s what we think. Vincenti needs you out of power. With Karyn Walde, he can shame you from office or, at a minimum, cause you enormous political problems. Homosexuality is not accepted here. Religious fundamentalists, whom you keep on a tight leash, would finally have the ammunition to fire back. You\u0027d have problems so massive, not even your germs could ease them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d never considered the possibility before, but what the American said made sense. Why else would Vincenti take Karyn? Yet there was something that needed to be mentioned. \"Like you said, she\u0027s dying of AIDS and may already be dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vincenti\u0027s no fool. Maybe he believes a dying declaration could actually carry more weight. You\u0027d have a lot of questions to answer-about that house, why Walde was there, the nurse. I\u0027m told that she knows things, along with many of your Sacred Band, who guarded the house. Vincenti has the nurse, too. That\u0027s a lot of people to contain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t America. Television can be controlled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But can fundamentalism? Along with the fact that you have plenty of enemies who\u0027d like to take your place. I think the man who just left here falls into that category. By the way, he met with Vincenti last night, too. Picked him up at the airport and drove him into the city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis man was superbly informed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Minister, we don\u0027t want Vincenti to succeed with whatever he\u0027s planning. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here. To offer our assistance. We\u0027re aware of your trip to Venice and of Cassiopeia Vitt returning here with you. Again she\u0027s not a problem. In fact, she knows quite a bit about what you were seeking in Venice. There\u0027s information you missed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me what it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I knew, I would. You\u0027ll have to ask Vitt. She and her two associates, Henrik Thorvaldsen and Cotton Malone, are aware of something called Ptolemy\u0027s riddle and objects known as elephant medallions.\" Davis held up his hands in a mock surrender. \"Don\u0027t know. Don\u0027t care. That\u0027s your business. All I know is that there was something to find in Venice, which you apparently missed. If you already are aware, I apologize for wasting your time. But President Daniels wanted you to know that, like the Venetian League, he, too, looks after his friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnough. This man needed to be put in his place. \"You must take me for an idiot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey exchanged glances, but no words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell your president I don\u0027t need his help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDavis appeared offended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I were you,\" she said, \"I\u0027d leave this Federation as quickly as you came.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A threat, Minister?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"Just a comment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strange way to talk to a friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood. \"You\u0027re not my friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE DOOR CLOSED AS EDWIN DAVIS LEFT THE CHAMBER. HER mind churned with an ability she\u0027d always managed when seizing an opportune moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKamil Revin reentered and walked to her desk. She studied her foreign minister. Vincenti thought himself clever, cultivating him to be a spy. But this Russian-educated Asian, who professed to be a Muslim but never entered a mosque, had acted as the perfect conduit for disinformation. She\u0027d dismissed him earlier from her meeting with Davis because he could not repeat what he did not know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You failed to mention that Vincenti was in the Federation,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRevin shrugged. \"He came in last night on business. He\u0027s at the Intercontinental, as always.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s at his estate in the mountains.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe noticed the surprise in the younger man\u0027s eyes. Real? Or an act? Hard to say with this one. But he seemed to sense her suspicion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Minister, I\u0027ve been your ally. I\u0027ve lied for you. I\u0027ve delivered enemies to you. I\u0027ve watched Vincenti for years and have faithfully acted as you instructed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had not the time to argue. \"Then show your loyalty. I have a special task that only you can perform.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSIXTY-NINE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSTEPHANIE LIKED SEEING HENRIK THORVALDSEN FRAZZLED. They\u0027d flown from Aviano Air Base in two F-16s, she in one, Thorvaldsen the other. They\u0027d followed Malone and Edwin Davis, who\u0027d landed in Samarkand, then she and Thorvaldsen continued eastward, landing at Kashgar, just across the Federation border into China. Thorvaldsen did not like to fly. A necessary evil, he called it before they\u0027d suited up. But a ride on a supersonic fighter jet was no ordinary flight. She\u0027d ridden behind the pilot, where the weapons system officer usually sat. Exhilarating and terrifying, the bumps and grinds at over thirteen hundred miles per hour had kept her on edge the entire two hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I cannot believe I did that,\" Thorvaldsen was saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe noticed that he was still shaking. A car had been waiting for them at the Kashgar airport. The Chinese government had cooperated fully with all of Daniels\u0027 requests. They were apparently quite concerned about their neighbor and willing even to partner with Washington in order to discover if their fears were real or imagined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t that bad,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here\u0027s a memo to file. Never, ever, no matter what anyone says, fly in one of those things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grinned. They were driving through the Pamirs, in Federation territory, the border crossing nothing more than a welcome sign. They\u0027d climbed in elevation, passing through a succession of barren rounded spurs and equally barren valleys. She knew that pamir was the name for this particular type of valley, places where winter loomed long and rainfall was sparse. Lots of coarse wormwood scrub, dwarf pine, with occasional patches of rich pasture. Mostly uninhabited country, villages here and there and the occasional yurts, which clearly distinguished the scenery from the Alps or the Pyrenees, where she and Thorvaldsen had last been together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve read about this area,\" she said. \"But I\u0027ve never been to this part of the world before. Pretty incredible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ely loved the Pamirs. He spoke of them religiously. And I can see why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you know him well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes. I knew his parents. He and my son were close. He practically lived at Christiangade when he and Cai were boys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen appeared weary in the passenger seat, and not because of the flight. She knew better. \"Cotton will look after Cassiopeia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt if Zovastina has Ely.\" Thorvaldsen seemed suddenly resigned. \"Viktor\u0027s right. He\u0027s probably dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe road flattened as they motored through one of the mountain passes and into another valley. The air outside was surprisingly warm, the lower elevations devoid of snow. Without question, the Central Asian Federation was blessed with natural wonder, but she\u0027d read the CIA fact sheets. The Federation had targeted the entire area for economic development. Electricity, telephone, water, and sewer services were being extended, along with an upgrade of roads. This highway seemed a prime example-the asphalt appeared new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe candle with the gold leaf still wrapped around it lay within a stainless-steel container on the rear seat. A modern-day scytale displaying a single Old Greek word.. Where did it lead? They had no idea, but maybe something in Ely Lund\u0027s mountain retreat would help explain its significance. They\u0027d also come armed. Two 9mms and spare magazines. Courtesy of the U.S. military and allowed by the Chinese.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Malone\u0027s plan,\" she said, \"might work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she agreed with Cotton. Random assets, like Viktor, were not reliable. She much preferred a seasoned agent, someone who cared about retirement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Malone cares for Cassiopeia,\" Thorvaldsen said. \"He won\u0027t say it, but he does. I see it in his eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw the pain on his face when you told him she\u0027s sick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s one reason why I thought she and Ely could relate to each other. Their mutual afflictions somehow became part of their attraction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey passed through two more sparse villages and kept driving west. Finally, just as Cassiopeia had told Thorvaldsen, the road forked, and they veered north. Ten kilometers later the landscape became more wooded. Ahead, beside a hard-packed drive that disappeared into the blackened woods, she spotted a sarissa plunged into the earth. Hanging from it was a small sign upon which was painted \"Soma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ely named the place appropriately,\" she said. \"Like Alexander\u0027s tomb in Egypt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and the car bumped and swayed up the rough path. The lane climbed a quarter mile into the trees where it ended at a single-storied cabin, fashioned of rough-hewn timber planks. A covered porch shielded the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like something from northern Denmark,\" Thorvaldsen said. \"Doesn\u0027t surprise me. I\u0027m sure it was a bit of home for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe parked and they stepped out into the warm afternoon. The woods all around them loomed quiet. Through the trees, northward she believed, more mountains could be seen. An eagle soared overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cabin\u0027s front door opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man stepped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was tall and handsome, with wavy blond hair. He wore jeans and a long-sleeved shirt with boots. Thorvaldsen stood rigid but his eyes instantly softened, the Dane\u0027s thoughts easily read as to the man\u0027s identity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEly Lund.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSEVENTY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSAMARKAND\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11:40 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCASSIOPEIA SMELLED WET HAY AND HORSES AND KNEW SHE WAS being held near a stable. The room was some sort of guesthouse, the furnishings adequate but not elegant, probably for staff. Boarded shutters closed the windows from the world, the door was locked and, she assumed, guarded. On the walk from the palace she\u0027d noticed armed men on rooftop perches. Fleeing from this prison could prove dicey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was equipped with a phone that did not work, and a television fed by no signal. She sat on the bed and wondered what was next. She\u0027d managed to get herself to Asia. Now what? She\u0027d tried to bait Zovastina, playing off the woman\u0027s obsessions. How successful she\u0027d been was hard to tell. Something had bothered the Supreme Minister at the airport. Enough that Cassiopeia suddenly was not a priority. But at least she was still alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA key scraped the lock and the door swung open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViktor entered, followed by two armed men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get up,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t ignore me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lunged forward and backhanded her across the face, propelling her off the bed and to the carpet. She recovered and sprang to her feet, ready for a fight. Both of the men standing behind Viktor leveled their guns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was for Rafael,\" her captor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRage filled her eyes. But she knew this man was doing exactly what was expected of him. Thorvaldsen had said he was an ally, albeit a secret one. So she played along. \"You\u0027re tough when backed up by men with guns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViktor chuckled. \"I\u0027m afraid of you? Is that what you\u0027re saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dabbed her busted lower lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViktor leaped onto her and twisted an arm behind her back. He wrenched her wrist toward her shoulders. He was strong, but she had trust that he knew what he was doing, so she surrendered. Cuffs clamped one wrist, then the other. Her ankles were likewise shackled while Viktor held her down, then rolled her onto her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring her,\" he ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two men grabbed her by the feet and shoulders, carrying her outside, down a graveled path to the stables. There, she was tossed, stomach first, across the back of a horse. Blood rushed to her head as she dangled, facing the ground. Viktor tied her secure with a coarse rope, then led the horse outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and three other men walked with the animal in silence, across a grassy stretch about the size of two soccer fields. Goats dotted the field, feeding, and tall trees lined its perimeter. Leaving the open expanse, they entered a forest and threaded a path to a clearing encircled by more trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was untied, slid from the horse\u0027s back, and stood upright. It took a few moments for the blood to drain from her head. The scene flashed in and out, then clarity came and she saw two tall poplars had been bent to the ground and tied to a third tree. Ropes led from the top of each tree and lay on the ground. She was dragged toward them, her hands freed from the cuffs, her wrists tied to each rope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the shackles were removed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood, arms extended, and realized what would happen if the two trees were freed from their restraint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the woods, another horse approached. A tall, gangly steed atop which rode Irina Zovastina. The Supreme Minister was dressed in leather boots and a quilted leather jacket. She surveyed the scene, dismissed Viktor and the other men, then dismounted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just you and me,\" Zovastina said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVIKTOR SPURRED THE HORSE AND RACED BACK TO THE STABLES. AS soon as he\u0027d arrived at the palace, Zovastina had ordered him to prepare the trees. It was not the first time. Three years ago she\u0027d similarly executed a man who\u0027d plotted revolution. No way to convert him, so she\u0027d tied him between the trunks, brought his coconspirators to watch, then slashed the bindings herself. His body had been ravaged as the trees righted themselves, part of him dangling from one, the rest from the other. Afterward, his compatriots had been easily converted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe horse galloped into the corral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMALONE WAITED IN THE TACK ROOM. VIKTOR HAD SMUGGLED him into the palace inside the trunk of a car. No one had questioned or searched the chief of the guard. Once the car was parked in the palace garage, he\u0027d slipped out and Viktor had provided him with palace credentials. Only Zovastina would recognize him and, with Viktor as his escort, they\u0027d easily walked to the stables, where Viktor said he could wait in safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not like anything about this situation. Both he and Cassiopeia were at the mercy of a man they knew nothing about, besides Edwin Davis\u0027 assurance that Viktor had, so far, proven reliable. He could only hope that Davis would confuse Zovastina enough to buy them time. He still carried his gun and he\u0027d sat patient for the past hour. No sounds came from outside the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stables themselves were magnificent, befitting the supreme leader of a massive Federation. He\u0027d counted forty bays when Viktor had first brought him inside. The tack room was equipped with a variety of quality saddles and expensive equipment. He was no expert rider, but knew how to handle a horse. The room\u0027s one window opened to the stable\u0027s rear, and offered no view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnough. Time to act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew his gun and opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one in sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned right and headed for the open barn doorway at the far end, passing stalls accommodating some impressive-looking steeds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spotted a rider, beyond the doors, racing straight for the stables. He shifted and hugged the wall, approaching the exit, gun ready. Hooves ground to a halt and he heard the coarse exhales of the horse, exhausted from the gallop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rider slid from the saddle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeet pounded the earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe readied himself. A man rushed inside, then stopped abruptly and turned. Viktor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t follow instructions well. I told you to stay in the tack room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lowered the gun. \"Needed some air.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ordered this place cleared, but somebody might still have come out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t in the mood for a lecture. \"What\u0027s happening?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Vitt. She\u0027s in trouble.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-venetian-betrayal-cotton-malone-3/page-24.html","bookId":2234,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:15:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:15:26 PM"}
