With your talent and my knowledge, you can grasp the entire Sky Spill Continent in your hands and rule the world!

Before that final strike occurred, Corpsemancer had shifted his brain into the skull of the bat puppet. Then, he had controlled his main body to perish together with Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis was a completely ruthless and insidious move. Once Lin Ming fell for it, he would still be severely wounded even if he didn’t die.

But during that fierce battle just now, in that critical moment, Lin Ming had been able to discover this point! Now that was truly horrifying!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSlowly, all of the martial artists began to understand what had happened.

When Lin Ming had first worn the Demon Emperor’s armor he placed some minor camouflage on it because he didn’t want to attract others’ attention. But, that powerful attack of Corpsemancer just now had completely ruined his careful concealment.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFor a short period of time, this armor should attract some people’s attention. But Lin Ming didn’t worry too much. Tens of thousands of years had already passed; it was impossible for others to recognize the Demon Emperor’s armor.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming received the broken bat puppet and the other puppets and then dropped down from the skies.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs he landed on the ground, all of the surrounding martial artists quickly scattered away from him in shock. Facing such an evil star, no one dared to remain near him, much less approach him. Even the city guard couldn’t dream of controlling him. If anyone died here because of him then they could only blame their bad luck.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming ignored the surrounding martial artists and gathered up Corpsemancer’s corpse and spatial ring. Then, he sent a sound transmitting talisman to Xiaoxiao and flew towards her. At this time he needed to recuperate from his wounds. In that battle just now he had used every ability he had. Not only did he consume a massive amount of energy but he was also seriously wounded.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“He won… Sir Lin actually won…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Xiaoxiao saw Lin Ming fly towards her, her lips faintly shivered.

Even if Heavencraft Pavilion called upon their complete resources they would still find it hard to move such a character to action.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“He really won. Young miss, your father’s spirit must be protecting us to have us encounter such an amazing person!” Beside Xiaoxiao, Grandma White began to cry. In these past days, Xiaoxiao had faced an infinite amount of pressure, but so had Grandma White. She had looked after Xiaoxiao as she grew up, and after receiving the grace of her father, she completely regarded Xiaoxiao as her own granddaughter.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen Lin Ming flew in front of Xiaoxiao, her entire face was wet with tears.

The current environment was not safe and he needed to ensure that he was at his peak condition. Otherwise, if he encountered a more powerful enemy he wouldn’t even be able to escape.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the martial artists of Witch Creek City saw Lin Ming fly towards Heavencraft Pavilion with Xiaoxiao and Grandma White in tow, all of them were flabbergasted.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“So it’s someone invited by Heavencraft Pavilion.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Just who is he?

Only when a martial artist reaches the Life Destruction realm can they burn some of their cultivation to renew their youth. And this is only appearances – it doesn’t lengthen their lifespan. Normally only female martial artists that value their appearance too much would do such things. Men normally wouldn’t. After all, rejuvenating your appearance requires you to burn not a small amount of your cultivation.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This is incredible news.

This was no longer just helping Xiaoxiao ascend to the position of Company Head, but had involved saving Xiaoxiao’s very life. As she deeply bowed before Lin Ming, her heart hated Xiaoxiao’s two great uncles to the extreme. She cursed them for their ruthlessness. They had actually gone to look for someone like Corpsemancer – that was the same as kicking Xiaoxiao into the depths hell.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eSince they no longer cared for face, she wouldn’t keep any more scruples with her.
