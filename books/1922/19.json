My stomach churned for a moment, then settled. \"You own the building I live in?\" I gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oddly enough, yes.\" He moved to sit on the table, facing me, his legs on either side of mine. He took my glass and set it aside; then warmed my chilled hands with his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you crazy, Gideon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth thinned. \"Is that a serious question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Yes, it is. My mom stalks me, too, and she sees a shrink. Do you have a shrink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not presently, but you\u0027re driving me crazy enough to make that a possibility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So this behavior isn\u0027t normal for you?\" My heart was pounding. I could hear the blood rushing past my eardrums. \"Or is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shoved a hand through his hair, restoring order to the strands I\u0027d mussed when we\u0027d kissed. \"I accessed information you voluntarily made available to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to you! Not for what you used it for! That has to violate some kind of privacy law.\" I stared at him, more confused than ever. \"Why would you do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had the grace to look disgruntled at least. \"So I can figure you out, damn it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you just ask me, Gideon? Is that so f**king hard for people to do nowadays?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is with you.\" He grabbed his drink off the table and tossed back most of it. \"I can\u0027t get you alone for more than a few minutes at a time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because the only thing you want to talk about is what you have to do to get laid!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ, Eva,\" he hissed, squeezing my hand. \"Keep your voice down!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI studied him, taking in every line and plane of his face. Unfortunately, cataloging the details didn\u0027t lessen my awe even a tiny bit. I was beginning to suspect I\u0027d never get over being dazzled by his looks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I wasn\u0027t alone; I\u0027d seen how other women reacted around him. And he was crazy rich, which made even old, bald, and paunchy guys attractive. It was no wonder he was used to snapping his fingers and scoring an orgasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze darted over my face. \"Why are you looking at me like that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About what?\" His jaw tightened. \"And I\u0027m warning you, if you say anything about orifices, preapprovals, or seminal emissions, I won\u0027t be held accountable for my actions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat almost made me smile. \"I want to understand a few things, because I think it\u0027s possible I\u0027m not giving you enough credit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to understand a few things myself,\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m guessing the \u0027I want to f**k you\u0027 approach has a high success rate for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon\u0027s face smoothed into unreadable impassivity. \"I\u0027m not touching that one, Eva.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. You want to figure out what it\u0027s going to take to get me into bed. Is that why you\u0027re here in this club right now? Because of me? And don\u0027t say what you think I want to hear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze was clear and steady. \"I\u0027m here for you, yes. I arranged it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly the threads the street hawker had been wearing made sense. We\u0027d been hustled by someone on Cross Industries\u0027s payroll. \"Did you figure that getting me here would get you laid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth twitched with suppressed amusement. \"There\u0027s always the hope, but I expected it would take more work than a chance meeting over drinks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right. So why do it? Why not wait until Monday lunch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you\u0027re out trolling. I can\u0027t do anything about B.O.B., but I can stop you from picking up some ass**le in a bar. You want to score, Eva, I\u0027m right here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not trolling. I\u0027m burning off tension after a stressful day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not the only one.\" He fingered one of my silver chandelier earrings. \"So you drink and dance when you\u0027re tense. I work on the problem that\u0027s making me tense in the first place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice had softened, and it stirred an alarming yearning. \"Is that what I am? A problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely.\" But there was a hint of a smile around his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew that was a lot of the appeal for him. Gideon Cross wouldn\u0027t be where he was, at such a young age, if he took \"no\" gracefully. \"What\u0027s your definition of dating?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA frown marred the space between his brows. \"Lengthy social time spent with a woman during which we\u0027re not actively f**king.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you enjoy the company of women?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe frown turned into a scowl. \"Sure, as long as there aren\u0027t any exaggerated expectations or excessive demands on my time. I\u0027ve found the best way to steer clear of those is to have mutually exclusive sexual relationships and friendships.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were those pesky \"exaggerated expectations\" again. Clearly, those were a sticking point with him. \"So, you do have female friends?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" His legs tightened around mine, capturing me. \"Where are you going with this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You segregate sex from the rest of your life. You separate it from friendship, work...everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got good reasons for doing that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you do. Okay, here are my thoughts.\" It was difficult concentrating when I was so close to Gideon. \"I told you I don\u0027t want to date and I don\u0027t. My job is priority number one and my personal life - as a single woman - is a close second. I don\u0027t want to sacrifice any of that time on a relationship and there\u0027s really not enough left over to squeeze in anything steady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m right there with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I like sex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Have it with me.\" His smile was an erotic invitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoved his shoulder. \"I need a personal connection with the men I sleep with. It doesn\u0027t have to be intense or deep, but sex needs to be more than an emotionless transaction for me.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bared-to-you-crossfire-1/page-19.html","bookId":1922,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:35 AM"}
