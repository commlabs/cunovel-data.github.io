Dressed in snow attire-overcoat, wool cap, muffler, boots, gloves-he shuffled along, aided by the plastic cane he\u0027d vowed not to use, trying not to wince with each step, though both ankles were swollen and raw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cane was in his right hand, a large envelope in his left. The snow was still light, but the ground was covered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the sidewalk, he turned and gazed upon the gathering in his living room. A packed house. A tree that improved with the distance. Above them a borrowed Frosty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHemlock was quiet. The fire truck and ambulance and police cars were gone, thankfully. Luther looked east and west and saw not a single person moving about. Most of them were in his house, singing along now, rescuing him from an episode that would undoubtedly be remembered as one of his more curious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Scheel house was well lit on the outside, but almost completely dark within. Luther crept up their driveway, his boots rubbing his wounds, the cane making the entire venture possible. On their porch he rang the doorbell and looked again at his house directly across the street. Ralph Brixley and Judd Bellington came around the corner, hurriedly stringing lights on Luther\u0027s boxwoods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes for a second, shook his head, looked at his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalt Scheel answered the door with a pleasant \"Well, Merry Christmas, Luther.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Merry Christmas to you,\" Luther said with a genuine smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re missing your party.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just have a second, Walt. Could I step in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther limped into the foyer, where he parked himself on a matt. His boots had accumulated snow and he didn\u0027t want to leave tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I take your coat?\" Walt asked. Something was baking in the kitchen, and Luther took that as a good sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thanks. How\u0027s Bev?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s having a good day, thanks. We started to come over and see Blair, but the snow started. So how\u0027s the fiance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A very nice young man,\" Luther said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBev Scheel entered from the dining room and said hello and Merry Christmas. She was wearing a red holiday sweater and looked the same, as far as Luther could tell. Rumor was that her doctor had given her six months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A pretty nasty fall,\" Walt said with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could\u0027ve been worse,\" Luther said, grinning, trying to enjoy himself as the butt of the joke. We won\u0027t dwell on that subject, he declared to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cleared his throat and said, \"Look, Blair\u0027s here for ten days, so we won\u0027t be taking the cruise. Nora and I would like for you guys to have it.\" He lifted the envelope slightly, sort of waved it at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir reaction was delayed as glances were exchanged, thoughts were attempted. They were stunned, and for quite a spell couldn\u0027t speak. So Luther plowed ahead. \"The flight leaves at noon tomorrow. You\u0027ll need to get there early to get the names changed and such, a slight hassle, but it\u0027ll be worth it. I\u0027ve already called my travel agency this afternoon. Ten days in the Caribbean, beaches, islands, the works. It\u0027ll be a dream vacation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalt shook his head no, but just slightly. Bev\u0027s eyes were moist. Neither could speak until Walt managed to say, with little conviction, \"We can\u0027t take it, Luther. It\u0027s not right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be silly. I didn\u0027t purchase the travel insurance, so if you don\u0027t go then the entire package is wasted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBev looked at Walt, who was already looking at her, and when their eyes locked Luther caught it. It was crazy, but why not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure my doctor will allow it,\" she said feebly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got that Lexxon deal on the front burner,\" Walt mumbled to himself as he scratched his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And we promised the Shorts we\u0027d be there New Year\u0027s Eve,\" Bev added, sort of musing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Benny said he might drop in.\" Benny was their oldest son, who hadn\u0027t been home in years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what about the cat?\" Bev asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther let them shuffle and strain, and when they ran out of their flimsy excuses he said, \"It\u0027s a gift from us to you, a sincere, heart-felt, no-strings-attached Christmas offering to two people who are, at this very moment, having a difficult time finding an excuse. Just go for it, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure I have the right clothes,\" Bev said predictably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo which Walt replied, \"Don\u0027t be ridiculous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith their resistance crumbling, Luther moved in for the kill. He shoved the envelope at Walt. \"It\u0027s all here-airline tickets, cruise passes, brochures, everything, including the phone number of the travel agency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the cost, Luther? If we go, then well reimburse you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a simple gift, Walt. No cost, no payback. Don\u0027t make it complicated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalt understood, but his pride got in his way. \"We\u0027ll just have to discuss it when we get back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere, they were already gone and back. \"We can talk about everything then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the cat?\" Bev asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalt pinched his chin in serious thought and said, \"Yes, that\u0027s a real problem. Too late to call the kennel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith uncanny timing, a large black furry cat sneaked into the foyer, rubbed itself on Walt\u0027s right leg, then gave a long look up at Luther.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t just leave him,\" Bev was saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, we can\u0027t,\" Walt said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther hated cats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could ask Jude Becker,\" Bev said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem. I\u0027ll take care of him,\" Luther said, swallowing hard, knowing perfectly well that Nora would get the chore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure?\" Walt asked, a little too quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cat took another look at Luther and slunk away. The feeling was mutual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe good -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;byes took much longer than the hellos, and when Luther hugged Bev he thought she would break. Under the bulky sweater was a frail and ailing woman. The tears were halfway down her cheeks. \"I\u0027ll call Nora,\" she whispered. \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld tough-as-nails Walt had moist eyes too. On the front steps, during their last handshake, he said, \"This means so much, Luther. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the Scheels were once again locked away inside, Luther started home. Unburdened by the thick envelope now, shed of its pricey tickets and thick brochures, freed of all the self-indulgence contained therein, his steps were a little quicker. And, filled with the satisfaction of making the perfect gift, Luther walked straight and proud with hardly a limp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the street he stopped and looked over his shoulder. The Scheels\u0027 home, dark as a cave just moments earlier, was now alive with lights being flipped on both upstairs and down. They\u0027ll pack all night, Luther thought to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA door opened across the street, and the Galdy family made a noisy exit from the Kranks\u0027 living room. Laughter and music escaped with them and echoed above Hemlock. The party showed little signs of breaking up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding there at the edge of the street, light snow gathering on his wool cap and collar, gazing at his freshly decorated house with almost the entire neighborhood packed into it, Luther paused to count his blessings. Blair was home, and she\u0027d brought with her a very nice, handsome, polite young man, who was quite obviously crazy about her. And who, at that moment, was very much in charge of the party along with Marty Whatshisname.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther himself was lucky to be standing, as opposed to lying peacefully on a slab at Franklin\u0027s Funeral Home, or pinned to a bed in ICU at Mercy Hospital, tubes running everywhere. Thoughts of snowballing down his roof, headfirst, still horrified him. Very lucky indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlessed with friends and neighbors who would sacrifice their plans for Christmas Eve to rescue him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up to his chimney where the Brixleys\u0027 Frosty was watching him. Round smiling face, top hat, corncob pipe. Through the flurries Luther thought he caught a wink from the snowman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStarving, as usual, Luther suddenly craved smoked trout. He began trekking through the snow. \"I\u0027ll eat a fruitcake too,\" he vowed to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a ridiculous idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe next year. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/skipping-christmas/page-20.html","bookId":2639,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:05 PM"}
