A FRIEND—IN NEED.","content":"\u0026nbsp;The suddenness with which Dean found himself cast adrift, and thrown upon his own resources, was enough to take away his breath. As merchants from time to time take account of stock, he felt that it would be wise now that he was about to set up for himself to ascertain the extent of his means. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He thrust his hand into his pocket, and drew out a small collection of silver coins and pennies. All told he found he had but sixty-seven cents, and he was probably twelve hundred miles from home. The chances were that it would cost him at least three cents a mile, or thirty-six dollars, to get back to Waterford. He would have been glad to have the thirty-six dollars, but he had no intention of going back until he could carry something with him. He did not want to acknowledge that he had made a failure.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dean ascertained that the town in which he was147 stranded (for he hadn\u0027t money enough to get out of it) was Granville. The village appeared to be half a mile away, and might at a rough guess contain a thousand inhabitants. Like most small Western towns, it consisted of one main street, with short side streets opening out of it. For a place of the size it seemed to be wide awake, and enterprising, more so than a village of corresponding population at the East.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n After spending a few minutes at the depot Dean took his valise, and trudged on in the direction of the town. What he should do when he got there he hardly knew. He was ready for anything that might turn up, and he did not worry as much as he would if he had been twice as old.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dean had accomplished about half the distance when a voice hailed him, \"Halloa, youngster!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dean turned in the direction of the voice and his glance fell on a man of perhaps twenty-five, who was stretched comfortably under a tree by the roadside. He had a knapsack and wore a velveteen suit. Something in his appearance gave Dean the impression that he was an actor.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Responding to his greeting, which was accompanied by a pleasant smile, Dean answered \"Good day!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Where are you traveling, young chap?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 148\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" responded Dean. \"I suppose I am on my way to the village.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you live about here?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"No, I live in New York State.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So do I, when I\u0027m at home, but I\u0027m not often at home.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Are you an actor?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s what I call myself. That\u0027s what I am styled by admiring friends, though some of the critics are unkind enough to express doubts. At present I am in hard luck. I came West with a dramatic company which has gone to pieces. I am traveling homeward on my uppers. Permit me to introduce myself,\" and he doffed a soft hat which he wore, \"as Cecil Montgomery, not wholly unknown to the metropolitan stage.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was something attractive in his good-humored recklessness that impressed Dean favorably.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"My name is Dean Dunham,\" he responded, \"not known on any stage.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Excuse the impertinence, but are you a young man of fortune?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, if you call sixty-seven cents a fortune.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Dean, my boy, you have ten cents the advantage of me. If you have any plans that with our united capital we may be able to carry out, my wealth is at your service.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 149\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have no plans except to get something to eat,\" said Dean.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am with you there,\" said the actor, rising with alacrity from his recumbent position. \"Know you of a hostelry?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"If that means a restaurant, I think we may find one in the village.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Wisely guessed. If you have no objection to my company, we will walk together.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I shall be glad of your company, Mr. Montgomery.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You do me proud, Mr. Dunham,\" and the actor once more doffed his hat, and bowed low. \"If you don\u0027t mind, my boy, suppose you tell me what brings you out here, so far from home? I came with a combination, as I have explained.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I came as private secretary with a gentleman—no, a man named Kirby. He chose to charge me with stealing his pocket-book, and discharged me on the train, refusing to pay me back wages.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Steal—with that honest face! Why, I\u0027d trust you with my entire wealth—fifty-seven cents—and wouldn\u0027t lose a minute\u0027s sleep.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thank you,\" said Dean, smiling. \"I hope I deserve your confidence.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So it seems that we are both in very much the150 same plight. We must hustle for a living. I wish you were an actor.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Why?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"We might give a joint performance, and so pick up a few pennies. Can you play on any instrument?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dean drew a harmonica from his pocket and displayed it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I can play a little on this,\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Give us a taste of your quality.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dean put the harmonica in his mouth and played several popular airs in very creditable style. He had practiced considerably in Waterford, and when he left home chanced to bring his favorite instrument with him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Montgomery applauded vociferously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That\u0027s capital!\" he said. \"I have an idea. Our fortune is made.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Is it? I\u0027m very glad to hear it.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Let me explain. I am a dramatic Jack of all trades. I can sing, dance, recite, and give imitations. Why shouldn\u0027t we give a joint exhibition? I venture to say we can charm and astonish the good people of Granville, and gather in golden shekels for ourselves.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But what am I to do?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Listen. You are the world-renowned Dean151 Dunham, the champion player on the harmonica, who have charmed tens of thousands, and whose name is a household word from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Do you understand?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I shall begin to think I am a humbug.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So be it! Humbug makes money and rides at ease, while modest merit goes barefoot and tramps over dusty roads.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That is complimentary to us, for it happens to be our condition just at present.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then let us abandon it! It doesn\u0027t pay. Will you join me, and try your luck with the good people of Granville?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dean hesitated a moment, but only a moment. He must do something, and nothing else seemed to present itself. If any one chose to pay for the privilege of hearing him play on the harmonica, he had no objection to receiving the money. Besides, he would be at no trouble in the matter. Mr. Montgomery would make all arrangements, and he would only have to take the part that might be assigned him.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am at your service, Mr. Montgomery.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Your hand on it! We will, we must be successful. In after years, when fame and money are yours, think that it was I, Cecil Montgomery, who assisted you to make your début.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 152\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I certainly will, Mr. Montgomery,\" said Dean, falling into his companion\u0027s humor.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By this time they had reached the village. A sign over a small one-story building attracted their attention.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Restaurant\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n and\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Coffee House.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Let us enter,\" said the actor. \"It is astonishing what an appetite I have. If we are to give an entertainment we must be fed.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Fortunately the prices at the restaurant and coffee house were very moderate, and the two travelers were able to make a plentiful meal, though it reduced their stock of money almost to nothing. After dinner Mr. Montgomery indulged in a five cent-cigar, but Dean declined to smoke.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Stay here, Dean,\" said his companion. \"I hear there is a weekly paper published in Granville. I will see the editor, and ask him to join us in the speculation, sharing the profits. The paper appears to-morrow. He can give us a big puff that will insure our success.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Suppose he won\u0027t do it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Leave it to me! I have a most persuasive tongue. Granville must not let such an opportunity153 slip. It must hear me act and listen to your melodious strains.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Nearly an hour passed. Then Montgomery came back radiant. \"It\u0027s all fixed,\" he said. \"You make your début to-morrow evening. I have engaged board at the hotel for us both.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n 154\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2961/81488.html","bookId":428,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 5:28:24 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 5:28:24 AM"}
