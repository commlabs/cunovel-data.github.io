Two copies. One to keep here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Plenty of room when we burn the Septateuch,” said Simony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No burning of anything. You have to take a step at a time,” said Brutha. He looked out at the shimmering line of the desert. Funny. He\u0027d been as happy as he\u0027d ever been in the desert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then . . .” he began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha lowered his eyes, to the farmlands and villages around the Citadel. He sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then we\u0027d better get on with things,” he said. “Every day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFasta Benj rowed home, in a thoughtful frame of mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been a very good few days. He\u0027d met a lot of new people and sold quite a lot of fish. P\u0027Tang-P\u0027Tang, with his lesser servants, had talked personally to him, making him promise not to wage war on some place he\u0027d never heard of. He\u0027d agreed.[10]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the new people had shown him this amazing way of making lightning. You hit this rock with this piece of hard stuff and you got little bits of lightning which dropped on to dry stuff which got red and hot like the sun. If you put more wood on it got bigger and if you put a fish on it got black but if you were quick it didn\u0027t get black but got brown and tasted better than anything he\u0027d ever tasted, although this was not difficult. And he\u0027d been given some knives not made out of rock and cloth not made out of reeds and, all in all, life was looking up for Fasta Benj and his people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t sure why lots of people would want to hit Pacha Moj\u0027s uncle with a big rock, but it definitely escalated the pace of technological progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one, not even Brutha, noticed that old Lu-Tze wasn\u0027t around any more. Not being noticed, either as being present or absent, is part of a history monk\u0027s stock in trade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact he\u0027d packed his broom and his bonsai mountains and had gone by secret tunnels and devious means to the hidden valley in the central peaks, where the abbot was waiting for him. The abbot was playing chess in the long gallery that overlooked the valley. Fountains bubbled in the gardens, and swallows flew in and out of the windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All went well?” said the abbot, without looking up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very well, lord,” said Lu-Tze. “I had to nudge things a little, though.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wish you wouldn\u0027t do that sort of thing,” said the abbot, fingering a pawn. “You\u0027ll overstep the mark one day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s the history we\u0027ve got these days,” said Lu-Tze. \"Very shoddy stuff, lord. I have to patch it up all the time-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Yes-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We used to get much better history in the old days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Things were always better than they are now. It\u0027s in the nature of things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, lord. Lord?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe abbot looked up in mild exasperation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Er . . . you know the books say that Brutha died and there was a century of terrible warfare?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know my eyesight isn\u0027t what it was, Lu-Tze.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well . . . it\u0027s not entirely like that now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just so long as it all turns out all right in the end,” said the abbot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, lord,” said the history monk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are a few weeks before your next assignment. Why don\u0027t you have a little rest?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, lord. I thought I might go down to the forest and watch a few falling trees.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good practice. Good practice. Mind always on the job, eh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Lu-Tze left, the abbot glanced up at his opponent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good man, that,” he said. “Your move.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe opponent looked long and hard at the board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe abbot waited to see what long-term, devious strategies were being evolved. Then his opponent tapped a piece with a bony finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eREMIND ME AGAIN, he said. HOW THE LITTLE HORSESHAPED ONES MOVE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEventually Brutha died, in unusual circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had reached a great age, but this at least was not unusual in the Church. As he said, you had to keep busy, every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rose at dawn, and wandered over to the window. He liked to watch the sunrise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey hadn\u0027t got around to replacing the Temple doors. Apart from anything else, even Urn hadn\u0027t been able to think of a way of removing the weirdly contorted heap of molten metal. So they\u0027d just built steps over them. And after a year or two people had quite accepted it, and said it was probably a symbol. Not of anything, exactly, but still a symbol. Definitely symbolic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the sun did shine off the copper dome of the Library. Brutha made a mental note to enquire about the progress of the new wing. There were too many complaints about overcrowding these days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople came from everywhere to visit the Library. It was the biggest non-magical library in the world. Half the philosophers of Ephebe seemed to live there now, and Omnia was even producing one or two of its own. And even priests were coming to spend some time in it, because of the collection of religious books. There were one thousand, two hundred and eighty-three religious books in there now, each one-according to itself-the only book any man need ever read. It was sort of nice to see them all together. As Didactylos used to say, you had to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIx was while Brutha was eating his breakfast that the subdeacon whose job it was to read him his appointments for the day, and tactfully make sure he wasn\u0027t wearing his underpants on the outside, shyly offered him congratulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mmm?” said Brutha, his gruel dripping off the spoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One hundred years,” said the subdeacon. “Since you walked in the desert, Sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really? I thought it was, mm, fifty years? Can\u0027t be more than sixty years, boy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh, one hundred years, lord. We had a look in the records.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really. One hundred years? One hundred years\u0027 time?” Brutha laid down his spoon very carefully, and stared at the plain white wall opposite him. The subdeacon found himself turning to see what it was the Cenobiarch was looking at, but there was nothing, only the whiteness of the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One hundred years,” mused Brutha. “Mmm. Good lord. I forgot.” He laughed. \"I forgot. One hundred years, eh? But here and now, we-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe subdeacon turned round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cenobiarch?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped closer, the blood draining from his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lord?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and ran for help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha\u0027s body toppled forward almost gracefully, smacking into the table. The bowl overturned, and \u0027gruel dripped down on to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Brutha stood up, without a second glance at his corpse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hah. I wasn\u0027t expecting you,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath stopped leaning against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHOW FORTUNATE YOU WERE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But there\u0027s still such a lot to be done . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYES. THERE ALWAYS IS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha followed the gaunt figure through the wall where, instead of the privy that occupied the far side in normal space, there was . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. . . black sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light was brilliant, crystalline, in a black sky filled with stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah. There really is a desert. Does everyone get this?” said Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHO KNOWS?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And what is at the end of the desert?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJUDGEMENT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha considered this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Which end?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath grinned and stepped aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Brutha had thought vas a rock in the sand was a hunched figure, sitting clutching its knees. It looked paralyzed with fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Vorbis?” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at Death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But Vorbis died a hundred years ago!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYES. HE HAD TO WALK IT ALL ALONE. ALL ALONE WITH HIMSELF. IF HE DARED.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He\u0027s been here for a hundred years?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePOSSIBLY NOT. TIME IS DIFFERENT HERE. IT IS . . . MORE PERSONAL.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah. You mean a hundred years can pass like a few seconds?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA HUNDRED YEARS CAN PASS LIKE INFINITY.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black-on-black eyes stared imploringly at Brutha, who reached out automatically, without thinking . . . and then hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHE WAS A MURDERER, said Death. AND A CREATOR OF MURDERERS. A TORTURER. WITHOUT PASSION. CRUEL. CALLOUS. COMPASSIONLESS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. I know. He\u0027s Vorbis,” said Brutha. Vorbis changed people. Sometimes he changed them into dead people. But he always changed them. That was his triumph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I\u0027m me,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVorbis stood up, uncertainly, and followed Brutha across the desert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath watched them walk away. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/small-gods-discworld-13/page-48.html","bookId":1629,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:19:48 PM"}
