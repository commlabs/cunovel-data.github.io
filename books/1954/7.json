He ripped my panties off in one clean sweep, and looked down at me with heavily-lidded eyes. His chest heaving with breath, he muttered, “Fucking beautiful, so God damn wet, baby. Need to taste you.” With that, his hands went behind my knees. He leaned down and pulled my throbbing, swollen pussy up to his mouth diving his tongue into my slick, wet mound, lapping with a groan that vibrated right through me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shudder rolled through me as his tongue moved up to flick over my clit, teeth tugging at the piercing. He drove a long finger deep into my hot core. “Oh fuck,” I hoarsely moaned as the feeling of what was to be one hell of an orgasm built, then nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI propped myself up on crooked elbows. Dropping my shaking legs to either side of his ripped body, I heard the unmistakable sound of a foil wrapper. Thank God, I thought. My eyes took in the sight before me; his hard, defined pecs, a silver ring in his left nipple, the ink that scattered across his impressive body. Looking up at his incredible size and watching him put on the rubber was incredibly hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pumped his hard length once, twice before looking up with parted lips. In his gravelly voice that I now knew meant he was turned on, he virtually growled, “Sweetest cunt I\u0027ve ever seen, babe. Gotta get inside it now.” He covered me with half his body, one hand gripped on my hip tight and his left forearm resting on the bed beside my head. He drove his impressive, thick length to the hilt on a long, drawn out groan. A whimper of pure bliss at the full feeling of his hard cock deep inside me, I shifted my hips urging him to move. “Stay still, babe. You’re so tight. You move, it\u0027ll be over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing him say this turned me on incredibly further. My hands moved of their own volition, scoring his back. “I need you to move, honey. I fucking need it,” I whimpered. Immediately, he pulled almost all the way out and rammed back in. My back arching up from the overwhelming lust, he found his rhythm and pounded in hard and fast, breathing heavy, lips and tongues everywhere. He reached his hand between us and tugged gently on my clit piercing, causing fireworks to go off, my body to spasm and white bursts to erupt behind my eyelids. “Oh God. Oh God, Mace,” I moaned loudly as I came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck babe,” he ground out before he seated himself all the way inside. His cock jerked and his eyes rolled back slightly while he held tightly onto my ass and came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShuddering as the waves of my orgasm decreased in intensity, we were both naked and breathing like we had ran a marathon. Mace leaned down and kissed me long, wet and slow. Tasting myself on him, my body reacted and I was instantly turned on again. The corners of his mouth tipped up as he mumbled against my mouth, “You\u0027re going to break me.” I laughed, a full all-out laugh which in turn made his eyes sparkle and his face go soft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned over the side of the bed and disposed of the used condom in the waste basket. As he flopped back down next to me, my stomach rumbled. “You want breakfast?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mmm, shower first,” he answered. Jumping up, he threw me over his shoulder and made for the bathroom, me giggling along the way. He sat me on the sink, turned on the shower and came back to stand between my legs. Wrapping them around his waist, he kissed me slowly and lifted me without breaking lip contact, walking into the steaming shower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMace had a mouth that could drive any woman crazy. He pulled back, kissing and nibbling my neck, slowly letting my feet touch the floor tiles. He got down on his knees, showering my body with attention as he went, finally making it to my drenched pussy. I stood my back against the tiles squirming, waiting for the sweet contact of his talented tongue. He lifted one leg and draped it over his shoulder, allowing him access to slowly nibble a path along my inner thigh from knee to pussy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head fell back against the tiled wall gasping for breath. My chest rising and falling fast, I was growing impatient. Just as his warm breath blew across my clit, he dropped my leg down and moved back slightly. “What the fuck! Noooo! Where are you going? I need that back, come back here.” I couldn’t even move forward to pull his head back to me. All the time, the ass was shaking with silent laughter. “Mace!” I stomped my foot. Yes, I stomped my foot but he was really good at that tongue-thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hold on, babe. I’ll get back there.” He stood with a soapy loofah in his hand and a wicked glint in his eye as he pinned me to the wall with his hips, his cock jerking against my stomach. The loofah made contact with one sensitive nipple as he made slow circles with it against my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” I sucked in a breath, “carry on then.” Mace chuckled and dropped his other hand down between us, flicking my clit ring as his mouth dropped to my other breast biting down, gently ripping a gasp from my lips. Damn, what was I protesting about again? I moved my hands from his shoulders up to his head, pulling him up and kissing him long and hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dropped the loofah and braced his hands against the wall. “Want your mouth on me, babe.” His dirty mouth and the feel of his hard thick cock pressing against me, caused me to moan. “On your knees, baby.” Mace stepped back as I moved my feet, when all of a sudden, I slipped on the soapy floor, falling forward, hands coming down to brace myself. Right when my hands should have made contact with the floor, I was poked in the eye by a long hard dick. “Shit!” Mace swore. “You okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t answer him. I was rolling around on the floor of the shower, one hand to my assaulted eye and laughing so hard I couldn’t breathe. I looked up to see Mace looking shocked before he burst out laughing, sliding down the wall to a sitting position. After a few moments, we calmed ourselves and he reached over cupping my face. “Any permanent damage?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled up at him. “I think I’ll survive.” I leaned down not wanting to waste such an impressive hard-on. I wrapped my lips around him and sucked hard and deep, hitting the back of my throat. Making him groan, he gripped my hair in his hands as his head fell back against the tiles. As I pulled back to do it again, my phone sounded from the bedroom; the loud ringtone playing out, “I just can’t wait to be king” from my favorite kid’s movie The Lion King. “Fuck me,” I murmured, Mace’s body shaking with laughter once again. I wasn’t sure if I should laugh or cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorst shower sex ever!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time we were done with our shower, which ended up cold by the time we’d finished washing each other and screwing in the bathroom, we got dressed and had breakfast; it was close to one in the afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding in the kitchen sipping coffee, it was time to do the awkward, “that was fun but—” moment. I reached past Mace, who was leaning on the counter, to grab my keys,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I gotta get to the shop. You still comin’ in to have more work done tomorrow?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled me over to him so I was standing chest-to-chest, and before I could say anything further, he nabbed my keys and started walking out the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down to the hand my keys had been in and followed out after him, determined to let him know we’d had fun but that was all it was. I wasn’t out for a relationship; the last one I’d had ended badly. Hell, the whole relationship was a disaster, one I intended not to repeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce at my car, he put the keys in the ignition and started my baby up. I opened my mouth to tell him I was perfectly capable of starting my own damn car when he held his hand up silently, telling me to shut it. That pissed me way the hell off. “What the fuck, Mace. I can start my own God damn car. You don’t get to—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMace grabbed me by the waist, hauled me against his body and pressed his mouth hard against mine. His tongue slipped in which effectively stopped my rant. I wanted to keep being pissy. I really did, but the man had a magic mouth. To this, my six out-of-this-world orgasms and I could testify.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled back slightly, pecked me one more time while I breathlessly tried to get my wits about me, and whispered, “Was listenin’ to the engine, babe. Fuel and air mixture on the carbie needs adjusting. Heard it yesterday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I knew that,” I whispered, a little dumbfounded that he’d picked it up. All other thoughts fleeting my head in that moment\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lunch at Ma’s on Sunday? I’ll be firing up the grill; pick you at eleven, yeah?” he told me in a rough voice. “Later, babe. Got shit to do.” He kissed me one last time. Before I could get a word out, he walked off, jumped in his truck and was gone. Leaving me flustered, I stared after him like a moron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was dumbfounded. It didn’t go at all like I planned. I looked around, still slightly confused, before snapping back to reality and dropping into the driver’s seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCocky asshole!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d been doubting myself since I arrived at the shop that morning. It pissed me off that he’d made me doubt myself. I was confident and didn’t take shit from anyone. Never in my life did I act like some dreamy-eyed moron over a guy. I was not that woman. I did like Mace, but I wasn’t sure what he was expecting. I had assumed, like me, he was up for a onetime thing; however, that morning, he’d told me he was taking me out again to his mother’s. That right there wasn’t a one night stand; it was something else entirely. I had no idea if I was even alright with that happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was hot, fan-fucking-tastic in bed and out of it. Plus, he was kinda sweet, but cocky and bossy, as well as a little annoying. There was something a little sad and pained beneath it all; he clearly tried to hide it, but it was there in his eyes. He’d been hurt, but how I did not know. I wasn’t sure if I even wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid I want to be involved with somebody who may be damaged? Did I want to be involved with anyone at all?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShut the hell up, Scar. You’re brain babbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI liked my life how it was; easy, steady and simple. I needed my girl, my best friend; she always either had advice, or would help me work out the million questions running through my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sent her a text message. Seconds later my cell buzzed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e911 my place 10pm. Bring ice-cream ~ S\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn it, babe. Chocolate? ~ T\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDouble-choc fudge! ~ S\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMace? ~ T\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYES! ~ S\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my phone away feeling a little calmer that Teen would come to the rescue and help me sort this cluster-fuck out. I went back to work engrossing myself in ink and skin until closing time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I arrived home, I had a nice hot shower and a few beers. I was dressed in stretchy yoga pants and a tiny tank when Teeny breezed through the front door. She took one look at me, turned her nose up slightly, and said, “Get up, skank. Get dressed; we’re hitting the bar.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up at her with a confused face. She was wearing designer jeans, a purple sparkly tank and matching wedges. There was no double-choc fudge in sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? I want ice-cream. Where the fuck’s the ice-cream?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tattered-love-needle-s-kiss-1/page-7.html","bookId":1954,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:11:08 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:11:08 AM"}
