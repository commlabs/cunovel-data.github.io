He used his fingers to spread several threads of Mana over the Dungeon’s entrance, stairway, and the doorway located on the other side of the room. It would allow him to be aware of external threats beforehand, and it would give him some time to prepare for it. This was supposed to be an impossible task for a normal level 2 hero, but Artpe was able to pull it off.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMaetel watched Artpe work.

There isn’t a thing you don’t know, you are great at everything except exercising. You are kind… Moreover, you are a hero!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“You are a hero too.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“I... I like being a hero, but in truth, I wouldn’t have minded if I hadn’t become a hero.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eArtpe finally remembered the words spoken by Maetel in the morning. She most definitely said there was something she wanted to be more than a hero.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eShe had role-played at being a hero everyday.

Her anger pretty much wiped away the fear she felt for the Dungeon and the future. Artpe smiled for the first time, and he gently patted her head.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e“I already know, you dummy.

However, the dream was probably something she could realize after the death of the Demon King.
