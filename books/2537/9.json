AFTER\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe road surface was brand-new¡ªthe road here used to be all potholes, with a few connecting stretches of highway. Now it was stretches of highway, occasionally interrupted by potholes, so the car coasted comfortably at seventy-five miles per hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s good to be an Other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew I wouldn\u0027t get caught in a traffic jam. I knew a dump truck with a drunk driver wouldn\u0027t suddenly leap out in front of me. If I ran out of gas, I could pour water into the tank and turn it into fuel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho wouldn\u0027t want a life like that for his own child?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat right did I have to blame Gesar and Olga for anything?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stereo system in the car was brand-new, with a slot for music disks. At first I was going to stick Combat Implants into it, then I decided I was in the mood for something more lyrical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put on White Guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know what you have decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know how things are there with you,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn angel has sewed the sky shut with thread,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDark blue and light blue...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t remember the taste of loss, I have no strength to resist evil, Every time I walk out the door, I walk toward your warmth...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cell phone rang. And the intelligent stereo system immediately turned down its volume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sveta?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re hard to get through to, Anton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvetlana\u0027s voice was calm. That meant everything was all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was the most important thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t get through to you either,\" I admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Must be fluctuations in the ether,\" Svetlana laughed. \"What happened half an hour ago?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing special. I had a talk with Gesar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is everything okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a premonition. That you were walking close to the edge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, watching the road. I have a clever wife, Gesar. Her premonitions are reliable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And everything\u0027s all right now?\" I asked, just to make sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now everything\u0027s all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sveta...\" I asked, holding the wheel with one hand. \"What should you do when you\u0027re not sure if you\u0027ve done the right thing? If you\u0027re tormented over whether you\u0027re right or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Join the Dark Ones,\" Svetlana replied without any hesitation. \"They\u0027re never tormented.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that\u0027s the whole answer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the only answer there is. And all the difference there is between Light Ones and Dark Ones. You can call it conscience, you can call it a moral sense. It comes down to the same thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have this feeling,\" I complained, \"as if the time of order is coming to an end. Do you understand? And I don\u0027t know what\u0027s coming next. Not a dark time, not a light time... not even the time of the Inquisitors...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s nobody\u0027s time, Anton,\" said Svetlana. \"That\u0027s all it is¡ª\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enobody\u0027s time. You\u0027re right, something\u0027s coming. Something\u0027s going to happen in the world. But not right this minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talk to me, Sveta,\" I asked her. \"I\u0027ve still got half an hour to drive. Talk to me for that half hour, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t got many minutes left on my cell,\" Svetlana answered doubtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can call you right back,\" I suggested. \"I\u0027m on an assignment, I\u0027ve got a company cell phone. Gesar can pay the bill.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And won\u0027t your conscience torment you?\" Svetlana laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I gave it a good drilling today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, don\u0027t call back. I\u0027ll put a spell on my cell,\" said Svetlana. Maybe she was joking, maybe she was serious. I can\u0027t always tell when she\u0027s joking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then talk to me,\" I said. \"Tell me what\u0027s going to happen when I get there. What Nadiushka\u0027s going to say. What you\u0027re going to say. What your mother\u0027s going to say. What\u0027s going to happen to us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything\u0027s going to be fine,\" said Svetlana. \"I\u0027ll be happy, and so will Nadya. And my mother will be happy...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drove the car, contravening the strict rules of the state highway patrol by pressing the cell phone to my ear with one hand. Trucks came hurtling toward me and past me on the other side of the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI listened to what Svetlana was saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in the speakers the quiet female voice carried on singing:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you come back, everything will be different,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow shall we recognize each other...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you come back,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I am not your wife or even your friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you come back to me,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho loved you so madly in the past,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you come back,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou will see the lots were cast long ago, and not by us... \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twilight-watch-watch-3/page-9.html","bookId":2537,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:51:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:51:30 PM"}
