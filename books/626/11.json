Wayside School is falling down, my fair lady,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Kids go splat as they hit the ground,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e hit the ground, hit the ground. Kids go splat as they hit the ground, my fair lady.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 60\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e D. J. was walking across the playground with his head down.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hi, Dr. Jolly,\" said Louis. Louis called D.J. \"Doctor Jolly\" because he was always smiling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But now D.J.\u0027s smile was upside down. He looked up at Louis.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Louis had never seen such a sad face. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e D.J. just shook his head, then looked back down at the ground and sadly walked away.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Louis felt like crying.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hey, Louis, what\u0027s wrong with D.J.?\" asked Ron.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He\u0027s so sad!\" said Deedee.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Louis, shaking his head. \"Hey, you guys want to play kickball?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No thanks,\" said Deedee. \"I can\u0027t have fun when D.J. is unhappy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Me neither,\" said Ron.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Across the playground, all the children quit their games when they saw D.J. Nobody could have fun when D.J. looked so sad.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Except Kathy! She sang:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Broken bones and blood and gore, blood and gore, blood and gore. Broken bones and blood and gore, my fair lady.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 61\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We don\u0027t have no school no more,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e school no more, school no more. We don\u0027t have no school no more, my fair lady.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The bell rang. D.J. sadly looked up at the school and sighed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hey, Deej, snap out of it,\" said Myron.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e D.J. stared through his friend.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You want to walk up the stairs with us, Dojo?\" asked Dameon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e D.J. shook his head. \"I need to be alone,\" he mumbled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dameon and Myron looked at each other, then started up the stairs, leaving their sad friend behind.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e D.J. headed on up, but stopped halfway between the ninth and tenth floors and sat down. He lowered his face into his hands and cried.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A moment later someone burst out laughing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e D.J. opened his eyes and saw Kathy standing over him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You shouldn\u0027t sit on the stairs, Dumb Jerk!\" said Kathy with glee. \"I almost kicked you in the head.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kathy always called D.J. \"Dumb Jerk.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She didn\u0027t like D.J. because he was always smiling. Now she was glad to see him so sad.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hi, Kathy,\" said D.J.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She plopped down on the stair next to him. \"What\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 62\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e happened?\" she asked. \"Did your dog die?\" She laughed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e D. J. shook his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are your parents getting divorced?\" she asked hopefully. \"Did your house burn down?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No,\" said D.J. \"My great-grandfather gave me a gold watch. It was over a hundred years old. I brought it to school today and-\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You lost it!\" Kathy exclaimed with delight.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e D.J. sadly nodded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kathy laughed. \"Oh boy, are you going to get in trouble!\" She rubbed her hands together. \"Your parents will ground you forever!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, my parents never punish me,\" said D.J. \"They know I learn from my mistakes.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh,\" said Kathy, a little disappointed. \"But your great-grandfather will hate you!\" she said. \"And hell never give you another present for the rest of your life. Not even for your birthday!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, he loves me no matter what I do,\" said D.J. \"He likes people, not things.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Again Kathy was disappointed. \"But the watch was worth a lot of money,\" she tried. \"And you\u0027ll have to pay for it out of your allowance.\" She laughed triumphantly, sure she had gotten him this time.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t get an allowance,\" said D.J. \"I don\u0027t like money.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kathy frowned. Still, she knew there had to be\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 63\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e some reason why he was sad about losing the watch. \"You\u0027ll never know what time it is!\" she squawked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So?\" asked D.J. \"Time isn\u0027t real.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kathy didn\u0027t know what D.J. meant by that, but she didn\u0027t care. \"Well, if you don\u0027t know what time it is,\" she told him, \"you\u0027ll miss all your favorite television shows.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t have a favorite television show,\" said D.J. \"I never watch television.\" He thought a moment. \"I\u0027m not sure if we have a TV in our house or not. Maybe there\u0027s one in a closet somewhere.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kathy glared at him. \"Well, then how come you\u0027re so sad you lost that dumb watch?\" she demanded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m afraid a bird might think it\u0027s food and choke on it,\" said D.J.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is that all?\" shrieked Kathy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e D.J. smiled. \"I guess you\u0027re right,\" he said. \"A bird probably wouldn\u0027t choke. In fact, maybe he could use it to make a nest. I hope so, don\u0027t you?\" He hopped to his feet. \"Thanks for talking to me, Kathy. I feel a lot better now. You\u0027re a good friend.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He hurried up to Mrs. Jewls\u0027s room, taking the stairs two and three at a time.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As D.J.\u0027s smile turned up, Kathy\u0027s smile turned down. She followed up after him, grumbling to herself. \"He doesn\u0027t like money. He doesn\u0027t worry about time. He never watches television. Why is he always so happy?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 64\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Everyone in Mrs. Jewls\u0027s class cheered when they saw D. J. enter the room smiling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kathy walked in behind him frowning.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls was getting ready to show a movie. She gave D. J. a piece of black construction paper.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hey, look!\" exclaimed Myron. \"Oddly found a watch!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Oddly, the bird, dropped the watch on the windowsill.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kathy couldn\u0027t believe it! \"It\u0027s D.J.\u0027s,\" she griped.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Myron gave the watch to D. J.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Here, you can have it, Kathy,\" said D.J. with a big smile. \"It\u0027s worth a lot of money, and this way you won\u0027t miss any of your favorite television shows.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kathy took the watch from him and put it around her wrist. \"It\u0027ll probably make my skin turn green,\" she groused.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls started the movie projector. Stephen turned off the lights. Dameon pulled down the shades. D.J. held the piece of black construction paper under his nose, because his smile was so bright.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/1989/56868.html","bookId":626,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 7:00:22 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 7:00:22 AM"}
