This time, however, there was no mistaking its presence. It was far more substantial than it was the last time. For an Adept whose powers just awakened, didn’t even know what their discipline was… it was startling, the speed at which it was evolving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It must mean your genetic talent is very strong…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGenerally speaking, the strength of one’s innate talent and the speed at which their Discipline grew were inexplicably tied. As everyone’s level of congenital talent was different, so too was their cultivation speed. The better their Talent, the faster their improvement. If, for instance, a person’s Talent could reach in the levels of ninth-rank, even if they didn’t spend time cultivating their abilities they would rise to a certain plateau all on its own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome people express it as genetic talent being the denominator, and their actual power level as the numerator. The higher the denominator, the easier it was for the numerator to quickly increase. But if the numerator wanted to break the bonds of its denominator, it would take special circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether through the West’s Fantascia Genetica Decoction, or the North’s cyborg programs, there were ways to break that denominator or catalyze its evolution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut ‘quick’ couldn’t appropriately describe the speed at which Zhou Qianlin’s powers were rising. Lan Jue thought back to his own youth, when his discipline had just awakened. His growth wasn’t nearly this fast. Jin Tao was the only person who could match it, and that was due to the genetica decoction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is there a problem?” Qianlin asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue shook his head. “Nope. It’s just your progress is incredibly fast. Strange. We should keep this under surveillance. We’ll wait a little while then check again, maybe then we’ll be able to get a clearer picture. I had no idea it was even possible for something like this to happen to someone your age.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you mean ‘\u003cem\u003emy age’\u003c/em\u003e?” Qianlin said through a frown. “Are you saying I’m old?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue grinned ruefully. “No, of course not. Much younger than this body guard. By the way, I brought you a souvenir.” As he spoke there was a flash of silver light, and suddenly a crystal box was in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pelagic Pearl twinkled within, awash in misty blue light. It tinted the entire room, like a drizzly afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s beautiful.” Qianlin admired. Her face betrayed the surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue flipped the box open and extricated the pearl. The thing itself was very small, perhaps the size of a cherry, and yet looking at it was like staring at a portrait of the universe. It was covered in layers of gradient blue, making it look like you were peering in to the misty depths of space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe placed the pearl in her hand. “Make sure to take good care of this. There may come a time when you’re in danger and I can’t immediately reach you. If that happens, pour your Discipline in to the pearl. It’ll create an elemental ward that will protect you. But first make sure you cover it with a drop or two of your blood. It’s necessary for the pearl to recognize you and your power. Afterwards the pearl will head your command.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSurprise emerged written across Zhou Qianlin’s pretty features. “This must have been very expensive. I can’t accept it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nah not expensive at all,” Lan Jue lied. “Anyway, this is me doing my job! Another way to make sure you’re being protected. After all, I can’t be at your side all day every day. What if I have to take a trip to another planet? With the pearl in your possession, it makes me feel better. I can relax a little. You should thing of some way to keep it on you at all times. A necklace, earring or something. When you find out what you like I can help have it made for you. For now, just keep it around.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQianlin was still shaking her head. She stuffed it back in Lan Jue’s hand. “Really too valuable. I don’t want it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue had bought the pearl at auction specifically to give Qianlin. He hadn’t thought that she wouldn’t want it. It certainly wasn’t something he anticipated. [1. For real woman. It’s not a diamond engagement ring, take the damn pearl! Of course, it \u003cem\u003ewas\u003c/em\u003e more expensive than a couple dozen diamond rings…]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not?” He asked. “Just because it’s valuable? You really don’t need to worry about any of that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQianlin raised her head, looking him in the eye. “We are neither relatives nor friends, how could I take something like that from you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue, seeing she was hesitant, backed away a few steps. “Look, I’m just your bodyguard. Protecting you is my responsibility.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA calm came over Qianlin’s features. “So you do it yourself, don’t rely on a pearl. I don’t need it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue looked at her, helpless. “Then how about this; I’ll loan it to you. When my contract is completed and our working relationship resolved, you can give it back. What do you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly Qianlin smiled, stepping closer to him. “My dear body guard, you must think I’m stupid. Don’t forget that I’m a national scholar in the NEU. You can’t assume I wouldn’t know about Lir’s famed Pelagic Pearl. A high-class, a-ranked power gem that can only bind with a single person. A drop of blood, and it has a master forever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue just stared at her for a moment, then an embarrassed grin spread across his face. “You sure are well informed boss! Bought I’ve already bought it, and it can’t be returned. If you don’t take, it’s a waste.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not my problem,” Qianlin said through a sweet smile. Alright, it’s time for you to go. A man and a woman alone so late at night is improper.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue looked at her beautiful face, her moist lips, that impish smile. She made him want to throw himself to the ground in a fit. \u003cem\u003eThis girl!\u003c/em\u003e He thought. \u003cem\u003eShe makes me want to-\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue took a calming breath. “I’ve made up my mind, there’s nothing for it. If you want accept it, please forgive my impropriety.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQianlin took a cautious step back. “What are you talking about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue chortled maliciously, and took a step forward. “What do you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could answer, his hand shot out to cover her small mouth. A flash of light, arcs of lightning, and Qianlin collapsed in to his waiting arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue held up her unconscious form. “You know what, boss? My job as your bodyguard means sometimes I have to take extreme measures to keep you safe [2. I kinda think he just wanted to shock the ever loving shit out of her.]. All of this is necessary, as part of my duty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled out her hand. A small pinprick of light, no thicker than a needle, appeared from his hand. It struck her finger, and a droplet of blood issued forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue gently placed the pearl against her finger. As he watched, the pearl drank the blood into itself. The dim light it normally expelled became a powerful halo that bathed the room in blue light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, the light congealed around Zhou Qianlin and was drawn in to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Qianlin’s body was numbed, she could neither move nor speak. But there was always the Soulcaller gem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Qianlin: \u003cem\u003eDon’t think you can skirt your duties as my bodyguard by giving me this thing! You absolutely must protect me in person!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue: \u003cem\u003eWhen did I ever say I was trying to get around our deal? I made a promise, and I’m going to stick to it. I may not always be best suited for the job, but isn’t this an example of me protecting you to the best of my abilities? You know I have a lot on my plate, and if something happens when I’m not around what will you do? This is exactly why I brought you the pearl. So behave.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a good five minutes for the intense light let off by the pearl to subside. Once again it was the pretty, quiet little pearl it had always been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue finally released Qianlin from the control he’d had over her. She quickly and violently shot to her feet. She was livid. “You \u003cem\u003eforced\u003c/em\u003e me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue coughed uncomfortably. “I’ve already explained my reasoning. I haven’t done anything I wasn’t contracted to do, boss.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Qianlin turned her face away, striking him from existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue snorted bitterly. “Bite the hand that feeds… this girl can’t recognize good intentions!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Qianlin’s head snapped back to him. In one fluid movement she grabbed his arm, pulled it out, and viciously bit him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue didn’t move or attempt to evade. He didn’t employ any methods to lessen the pain. He just took it. His expression even bore a sort of softness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQianlin veritably gnawed at him, but when she noticed he wasn’t reacting she let go. She lifted her head and glared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hard eyes met his gentle gaze, and the two simply looked at each other. Her look softened and then, soundlessly, she pressed herself in to his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer silken tresses had come loose, their fragrance filling his nostrils. The scent was burned on his heart. His raised his arms, as though to wrap them around her, but after a few moments frozen in the air he let them drop. Like he’d lost his nerve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath, then pulled her to arm’s length. “It’s late, I should go. You should sleep soon. I’ll bring the pearl back once I’ve fixed it up.” Without waiting for her response, he fractured in to a thousand bolts of electricity and vanished in to the wall socket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQianlin swayed slightly on her feet, without his weight to support her. It had startled her. She thought back to it, that brief moment… clearly she’d felt there was some impenetrable barrier between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Jue made his exit from the villa and Mount Tian as quickly as he was able. He wasted no time returning to Skyfire Avenue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he got back, he didn’t immediately go to sleep. He pulled out some tools, some precious metals, and set about fiddling about in his apartments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"text-align: center\"\u003eζ\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the intense heat, the silvery-white metal began to change. Under Lan Jue’s deft guidance, slowly it began to take shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis cutting tool flashed, slicing away the metal and leaving slivers along his desk. Eventually, a fair and elegant bracelet began to reveal itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"text-align: center\"\u003eζ\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Qianlin washed her face and brushed her teeth, preparing for the morning.
