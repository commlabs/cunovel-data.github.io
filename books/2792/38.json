I smiled and looked at Gerry, “Thank you for the letter.” I was giddy about the night he was going to have, but I reined it in and kissed his cheek before I walked past him. I grabbed Danny’s arm, “I want to go to the front stage area. My friend Lise is there. I don’t want to be back here. I don’t even want to be here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked upset, “Stay. Please stay back here. We told him you were coming and he’s been better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hardened my heart, “I don’t give a fuck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, “Still mad, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes narrowed. He put his hands in the air, “Alright, I’ll be back in a minute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrapped my arms around myself, wishing I had a jacket or a snowsuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Princess?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned like a well-trained seal, even though it wasn’t my name. Lochlan…shit I thought his name… looked rough, sexy rough. It suited his bad boy of rock and roll look. His dark hair was still in the fohawk-mullet thing and his look was dark as sin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You got a tattoo?” He looked devastated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. I wanted to say his name again. I wanted to hear it roll off my tongue or around in my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked like he was going to take a step towards me but I spoke quickly, “Congratulations on the show. This is huge.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled bitterly, “It ain’t no Fargodome, but it’s a step up from the bar circuit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, I couldn’t help myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My mom is in a home now.” He looked like he didn’t know why he said it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, “I know. She writes me letters.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled the most broken smile, I’d ever seen on his face, “Yeah, Gerry has a new way for her to press a letter and make words. She uses the iPad he bought her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, “Good. The blinking made me tired and I was only writing down the numbers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You staying backstage?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, hating the look on his face, but I was about to buckle and jump him. I needed to be away from him, “No. My friends are front row.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bit his lip and winced, “Well, will you stick around after?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head with the last of my self-preservation, “No. I have a lot of homework.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean came to my rescue, earning himself an evil look from Lochlan. His name was starting to fit back into my mind. It would be so easy to start saying it again, regardless of the fact it burned me to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored Lochlan and pointed, “Danny said they are holding the seat, and some girl who is screaming right now and freaking out, is taking your place backstage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled and nodded, “Have a good show.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes got worse, “Don’t leave,” his words were a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned away quickly and waved, “See ya ‘round.” I followed Dean to the edge of the curtains. He rubbed my back, “You did so well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him and Gerry, “I think I can do this. I can see him if I have to, you know, ‘cause of you, Danny and Mike.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“ERIN!” I turned to see Mike running for me. He picked me up, smelling my neck, “Girl, how have you been?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, “Good.” I looked behind him to see the dark blue eyes still watching me. I hugged Mike again and blushed when he gushed, “You look hot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDean nodded, “That is the response I was looking for.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You been lifting weights or something?” Mike grinned, not noticing Lochlan getting closer and closer behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, ignoring that he had joined the conversation. I spoke softly, “Hot yoga. When the shitty weather is over, I’ll be running again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerry smacked me in the butt, “Dean said she’s been living on coconut-cream pies from some hole in the earth dive, so she has some extra junk in her trunk. I think it looks good though. You’re curvy now. Kind of sexy. I bet you look good in the business suits now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot him a look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike nodded, “You do look good. The coconut-cream pies are doing you some good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I looked back at Mike, Lochlan was smirking from behind him. I looked down, “I better go. It was nice seeing you guys.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike hugged me again. I kept my eyes down, so I wouldn’t have to see the dark blue eyes staring at me. I waved again, as I turned and walked away. I went to where a bouncer was standing. He moved and I sat. Lise smiled at me, “Oh my God, I didn’t think you were coming. I asked you like a month ago and you said no. I love your dress.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, “Thanks. Yeah, Dean changed my mind. I wanted to see everyone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe winked, “Your brother is looking fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, he is in his element. This is him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled, “This is everyone’s. Anyone would want this life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was about to tell her how wrong she was, but I decided to keep my mouth shut. Let her have her fantasies. Everyone needed a dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl on the other side of me whispered, “So the girl who had your seat is the one he’s gonna fuck tonight. Lucky, huh? Every show Lochlan picks a girl from the audience and she stays with him backstage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt sick, but I made myself remember how strong I was. I smiled, “Poor thing. I heard those musicians can’t get it up, ‘cause they do too much coke.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a face, “Ewww, really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yikes, I was all jealous, but damned if I’m suffering through some limp biscuit. God love her for getting picked.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed. Lise hit my arm, “You are wicked.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged, “Whatever. She got to go backstage because I didn’t want to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLise winked, “The best part of the show is up front.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never thought about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe opening act was good. They were indie sounding and fun. The songs were toe tapping almost. They did a great show but we all knew why we were there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey left the stage after receiving a good cheer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLise looked at me with an animated smile, “Eeeeeek.” she squealed. I laughed until the lights went black, then my heart raced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLights flashed onto the crowd. We could see smoke above our heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice sang softly from the dark of the stage. A light flicked on to Leon. He played the keyboard softly. Another light flicked on revealing Gerry. He was lightly hitting the cymbals. The next light was Mike with the bass. With each light being switched on, the crowd screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the light hit Loch, they lost their minds. He sang softly until the light flicked onto him. Then he rocked. The crowd was off their feet. I was shoved forward instantly. My hands shot into the air, and I clapped along with everyone. The song was intense and fast. His jumped to life, using the whole stage. Song after song my wall crumbled. I screamed along with the fans. They were still amazing. His control over the crowd was ridiculous. He was still the puppet master.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLise and I gripped to each other, screaming and shouting the words to the songs. The girl next to me cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was in a trance, a Lochlan trance, shit. But then I felt an elbow in my back. I shoved back. We were pressed into the stage. They did their last song of the night. I was deaf and voiceless but it was bliss; the best thing that had happened to me in a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart was full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We want to thank y’all for coming to the show. We love Boston!” He threw a hand in the air. The crowd screamed and shoved forward again. I winced. I was going to have stage bruises later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved, “Night y’all!” he pointed at me, “Don’t leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy jaw dropped. Lise screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl next to me made a face, “Oh God. He wants to invite you for the limp biscuit too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to laugh but the crowd pushed forward again. The lights shut off and then on. The band was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed Lise’s hand. It was getting chaotic in there. Danny came to the front of the stage and put a hand out for me, “Come with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated but I was again pushed forward. I put Lise’s hand in his, “Her first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hauled her up like she weighed nothing. I put my hand in his, but I was pushed into the stage. I almost fell under the people. I heard Lochlan shout and grab my arm. He hauled me onto the stage, just as the bouncers were getting everyone back and forcing people out the doors. I looked out over the sea of people and then felt myself get picked up and dragged to the back. I slapped his arm, “Put me down, Loch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated for a second; I could feel his heart beating against my squished arm. He put me down. His face softened, “Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slapped his hand away when he tried to touch my cheek, “I’m fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLise was smiling at Danny like he was her savior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerry brought out trays of champagne, “To celebrate our Boston concert!” He seemed to miss my near death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guys all grabbed one. He handed one to me and Lise. Leon gave me a sly grin. I scowled at him. Mike backhanded him lightly in the stomach. He nodded at the darkened face stalking me like I was prey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeon looked confused, and then I literally watched the light bulb come on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLochlan held up his glass, “To Danny and the band for the amazing job you all do. I feel like the luckiest guy ever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glasses clinked. I sipped the champagne. He walked in front of me, pushing me back with his presence, “Don’t leave me. Let me try to explain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, “I can’t do this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took my champagne and put it down on the table next to us. He took my hands in his. The smell and warmth was too familiar. It made me feel sick almost. His eyes burned down on me. I pulled away, “I have to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Dean. He nodded and gave Gerry a kiss, “See you at home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled at them all, “Excellent show.” I looked at Lise, “You coming?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Danny, ‘No. I’ll get a ride home with him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smirked, “Eww. Okay. Night all.” I walked away, feeling their eyes burning into my back. We had to drive with the other people out of the parking lot. It took forever to get back on the main road. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/my-side/page-38.html","bookId":2792,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:37:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:37:38 PM"}
