{"id":1207,"no":15,"title":"Chapter 15","content":"IT HELPED TO HAVE friends in the office of the Surgeon General in Starfleet, and those Leonard McCoy had in abundance. So when the rather curious \"situation\" arose, it was McCoy who was summoned in for a consult out of deference to his long-standing relationship with the … as it was delicately put … \"person in question.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He wished that Jim were around to handle this, but he was off doing that damned fool diving of his. Kirk had regaled him with tales of deep-sea explorations, wearing antiquated gear and a bathing suit rather than proper insulated suits with their built-in fail-safe oxygen supplies. \"That\u0027s not really undersea diving,\" he\u0027d sniffed. \"You don\u0027t feel like you\u0027re part of the sea.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027ll become a permanent part of the sea if you\u0027re not careful,\" McCoy had grumbled at him. But he\u0027d decided not to push it too much; the problem with Kirk was that he\u0027d probably come up with something even more dangerous to do. That\u0027s the kind of guy he was: totally uncaring about personal safety. Under the impression that trivialities such as mortality applied to lesser beings.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Hopefully that would change as soon as Kirk started the faculty assignment at Starfleet Academy. Even that, though, made McCoy apprehensive. There was only one place where Kirk would truly be happy, and that was in the command chair of a starship. But they\u0027d been giving him the full treatment, Starfleet had. Emphasized all the experience he had to share. Convinced him that by teaching at the Academy, he could be improving Starfleet at its core.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And he\u0027d bought it. Blast him, he\u0027d bought it. McCoy knew, in his heart of hearts, that it was going to cost Kirk in the long run. His body might have been on Earth, but his soul was in the stars. He would keep running faster and faster, looking for something that he didn\u0027t even know he was missing. And when he finally realized that whatever it was he was searching for was still gone—light-years away and forever beyond his reach—he would start to wither. Wither and die. McCoy could see it clear as anything, but Kirk—home and flush with triumph from his second five-year mission—had been blinded to it. Blinded by the success and accolades. And maybe, God help him, by the legend that was building around him. McCoy had no doubt that, sooner or later, Kirk would realize the hideous mistake. Realize what he\u0027d gotten himself into because he\u0027d believed his own press.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Damn his ego,\" he muttered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Damn whose ego, Doc?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e McCoy looked up and saw Mr. Sulu standing there, his arms folded across his chest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No one\u0027s,\" replied McCoy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sulu smiled. \"Oh, come on now, Doc. You ask me to come meet you here at the Surgeon General\u0027s building … you\u0027re all mysterious about it … and now you won\u0027t even tell me what\u0027s on your mind?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, we\u0027ll … discuss it,\" said McCoy. \"Uhm … sit down, Sulu. How are things going with you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sulu looked at McCoy appraisingly. It was clear he knew something was on the doctor\u0027s mind. How could he not, after all? McCoy had summoned him, with some degree of urgency, from Starfleet Headquarters, and obviously had some reason for doing so. But he also knew that McCoy wasn\u0027t the type to be rushed. He\u0027d get to it in his own good time, so it was simplest to go along with McCoy at his own speed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Things are going fine, Doc,\" Sulu said as he sank into the chair opposite McCoy. It wasn\u0027t McCoy\u0027s office, but merely one that he was borrowing. \"Have you heard?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Heard what?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ve been offered the position of first officer aboard the Bozeman. Had a subspace meeting with Captain Bateson. He\u0027s,\" and he smiled slightly, \"not exactly Captain Kirk. More the … cerebral type.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Funny. For some reason, I have trouble picturing you any place other than the helm of the Enterprise.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So do I. But let\u0027s face it, Doc. The newest Enterprise refit will take at least six to eight months … I\u0027ve even heard as much as a year. Plus there\u0027s talk about this new Excelsior class that will make the Enterprise obsolete. I have as much loyalty to the Enterprise as the next man, Doc … but the writing\u0027s on the wall. Two, maybe three years tops, and she\u0027ll be retired, and I\u0027ll be … what? Three years older? Still at helm?\" He shook his head. \"I have to admit that Admiral\u0027s Kirk\u0027s decision to teach shook me a bit. At first I was a bit stunned. But then I thought, Well, with the sort of career he\u0027s had, he deserves it, right? He\u0027s entitled.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e McCoy said nothing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sulu continued, \"Somehow I was perfectly satisfied with the status quo as along as James Kirk was in that command chair. But if I\u0027m going to be out there on my own, Doc, then it\u0027s about time I started working on my career, too. Sink or swim, as they say.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"As they say.\" He paused. \"Sulu, do you ever wish there was … something else? Something more, besides a career?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wish?\" He shrugged. \"I\u0027ve … thought of it from time to time, of course. But this is who I am, Doctor. It\u0027s what I do. No use complaining about it now.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e McCoy shifted uncomfortably in his seat, and Sulu looked at him a bit askance. \"Doc …?\" He let the prompt hang there in the air. \"Doc … we\u0027ve known each other for too long to be shy about things now. If there\u0027s something on your mind …\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You know,\" McCoy said, \"no matter how many times I\u0027ve had to deliver news like this, it doesn\u0027t get easier. Sulu … Susan Ling is dead.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sulu stared at him a moment and then said calmly, \"I\u0027m … sorry to hear that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e McCoy looked surprised. \"Don\u0027t take this wrong, but … I\u0027d have expected even Spock to give more of a reaction than that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"More of a reaction?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes! I tell you she\u0027s dead, you sit there cool as you please and just tell me you\u0027re sorry to hear it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sulu was about to reply, then stopped, reconsidered, and started again. \"Doc … there\u0027s something I\u0027m missing here. I feel badly that this friend of yours is—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mine? I never …\" He sighed in exasperation, then turned and said, \"Computer—file on Susan Ling.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A file appeared on the screen and McCoy swiveled it around for Sulu to see.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sulu stared at it … and went ashen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e McCoy saw the instant change in Sulu\u0027s demeanor, and immediately realized the magnitude of his error. \"Oh, God … you didn\u0027t know her real name, did you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sulu shook his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m sorry, Sulu.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He stared at the image on the screen. Ling Sui, as he had known her, stared back at him with that slightly uncomfortable expression one always has when posing for some sort of official photograph. Words ran alongside the picture and he tried to read them, but they blurred together. He rubbed at the bridge of his nose and sat back, trying to compose himself. \"How?\" he managed to ask.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sakuro\u0027s disease. Apparently the symptoms first manifested while she was on Marris Three, and their facilities aren\u0027t exactly up to Federation standard. She managed to get to a starbase, but by then it was too late.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sulu looked down at his lap. \"I … haven\u0027t seen her for years. Six … maybe seven years, I think.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Haven\u0027t thought about her since then?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He shook his head, and a small smile touched his lips. \"Oh, I\u0027ve … remembered her … from time to time. I\u0027ll tell you about it sometime … although it would help if you had a few drinks in you to make it believable. I wish …\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e McCoy raised an eyebrow. \"What?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I was just thinking that … Susan … was a remarkable woman. Being with her was like trying to snag light rays. And I sometimes wish I\u0027d … I\u0027d managed to have more of her than just a fleeting memory.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well … you\u0027re always supposed to be careful of what you wish for, because you may get it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The comment jogged at Sulu\u0027s memory for a moment, and then he recalled. He shook his head slowly. \"That\u0027s funny.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There\u0027s something funny about this?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, only in that Chekov said exactly the same thing shortly before I met Susan.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then, slowly, a tumbler clicked over in Sulu\u0027s mind. He looked at McCoy with curiosity and said, \"Doc … how did you know that I knew her?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e McCoy sighed. \"I was wondering when you\u0027d ask. She didn\u0027t have a formal will, precisely, but she did leave behind a document and you were named in it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What, she left me something?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not something exactly …\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was a knock at the door, and a soft voice came from the other side. It was female, very young, with a slightly musical lilt to it. \"Doctor? I\u0027m lonely in the other room. Can I come in? Is he here yet?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sulu and McCoy exchanged glances.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And Sulu knew.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Instantly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His voice was a hoarse whisper. \"You can\u0027t be serious.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e McCoy nodded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But …\" Sulu felt as if he\u0027d lost physical contact with the rest of his body. \"But … we just … there was just that one time, in the desert …\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A lot about humans has changed over the millenia, but the fact that it only takes once isn\u0027t among them,\" McCoy said dryly. \"Would you like to meet her?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Before Sulu could get out another word, the door slid open.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She was wearing a carefully pressed blue dress. Her hands were interlaced in front of her, her fingernails delicately painted red. Her long black hair was drawn back in a ponytail. Her face …\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her face looked like someone had taken Ling Sui\u0027s head, shrunk it to child size, and stuck it on a little girl\u0027s body.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She studied Sulu carefully.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are you my father?\" she asked. Her English was carefully spoken and slightly accented. Sulu knew immediately that she was multilingual.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sulu looked to McCoy. McCoy nodded slowly. \"First thing we did,\" he said softly. \"Ran a test cross-matched against your gene files. There\u0027s no doubt.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He turned back and stared at her. \"It … appears so,\" he said in answer to her question. He was looking for something to say, something memorable, something that he could look back on years from now and marvel at its brilliance and pithiness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And you are—?\" he asked after a moment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It wasn\u0027t brilliant. It wasn\u0027t pithy. It wasn\u0027t even especially useful, because she simply stared at him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Not wanting to leave matters hanging, McCoy said, \"Hikaru Sulu … this is Demora Ling. Or … Demora Sulu, if you …\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Get married?\" asked Demora.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Despite the fragility of the situation, McCoy was nonetheless amused. \"I was going to say \u0027arrange an adoption.\u0027 But that\u0027s pretty much up to you. To both of you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sulu felt as if he were reeling. It seemed all a hell of a lot to absorb at one time, and there was Demora simply staring at him with Ling Sui\u0027s eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So … you\u0027ll be going off on another ship soon, right? The Bozeman?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sulu nodded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That sounds exciting. Have a good time.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Slowly Sulu hunkered down until he was on eye level with her. \"Honey,\" he said slowly, \"I\u0027m … look, I want you to be a big girl about this …\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You don\u0027t have to sound so patronizing,\" she informed him airily.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m … sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to. Demora … could you wait outside? I know you\u0027ve been there for a while,\" he said upon seeing her face start to twist in exasperation. \"Just a short while longer. And then we\u0027ll go …\" For want of a better word, he said, \"home.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She seemed to be looking straight through to the back of his head. Then she nodded and stepped into the outside room, the doors hissing behind her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He remained in a crouched position, his back to McCoy. \"It\u0027s … a lot to absorb. You understand, don\u0027t you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wish there had been a smoother way to tell you.\" He paused. \"What are you going to do?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know. Not yet. I just … need time to think.\" Slowly he straightened up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I know this may sound like an odd thing to say at this time, Sulu, but …\" McCoy stuck out a hand. \"Congratulations. You\u0027re a father.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank you, Doctor.\" Sulu shook the hand. Then he started for the door, stopped, turned back to McCoy, and said once more, with unmistakable incredulity in his voice, \"It was just the one time.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I hope it was worth it,\" said McCoy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Actually … I barely remember it. I was half asleep,\" said Sulu, and he walked out the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And McCoy shook his head and muttered to himself, \"Well, it\u0027s pretty damned obvious which half was awake.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/939/28431.html","bookId":44,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 2:55:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 2:55:11 AM"}
