What were you thinking, that could so drag you from this place?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas there longing in Kadagar’s eyes? He didn’t think so. ‘Lord, no more than weariness. A moment’s rest.’ He looked to the assembled legions. ‘They are ready. Good.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he moved to join his retinue Kadagar stayed him with one hand and leaned close to whisper, ‘ What were you thinking about, brother? ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rag doll . ‘Old friend, it was a moment empty of dreams. A place of grey dust. That and nothing more.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKadagar let go, stepped back. ‘Aparal – is it true?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Lord?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The laughter—’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, Lord. A Hust waits for us, in the hands of a Shake warrior.’ He pointed at the carcass of the dragon. ‘Two passes of the blade, to slice through Iparth Erule’s neck.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He must be killed! This Shake warrior!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes, Lord.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKadagar lifted one hand to his brow, reminding Aparal of the father, of poor, lost Krin Ne Fant. ‘But … how?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAparal cocked his head. ‘Lord? Why, when all the others have fallen, when he alone remains. When twelve dragons break through. Sire, this is not a legion of Hust. It is one sword.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Kadagar was nodding now, eyes flooding with relief. ‘Just so, brother.’ He glanced back at the carcass. ‘Poor Iparth Erule.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Poor Iparth Erule.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKadagar Fant, Lord of Light, then licked his lips. ‘Such a terrible waste.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn every echo that reached Sandalath Drukorlat, she heard ghosts laughing. Withal sat close, down on the stone of the dais, almost at her feet, but it seemed he was dozing, exhaustion making a mockery of his vigil. She did not mind. Mortal failure was ever tinged with irony, was it not?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes, listening, waiting for the visions to return. Were these sendings from Mother Dark? Or just the cluttered rag-ends of all those lives surrendered to these walls and floors of stone? Mother, I doubt there is anything of you in these scenes. The gloom is of their own making, and those hard voices rocking so back and forth in my skull, well, I know them all .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne side crimson with blood, Anomander Rake straightening to face the Hust Legion. ‘The invasion has just begun,’ he told the waiting warriors. ‘We risk being overwhelmed.’ He drew a slow, deep breath, jaws briefly clenching in pain. ‘I shall wait for them beyond the Rent, to deny them the Throne of Shadow. This leaves the gate itself. Hust Legion! You shall march to the gate. You shall march through it. You shall take the battle to them, and hold them there. And,’ he scanned the rows of helmed faces, ‘when the last five of you remain, you must give your lives to sealing that wound. You shall, Hust-armed and Hust-armoured, for ever close Starvald Demelain.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWailing shrieks from blades and scaled breastplates, from helms, from greaves and gauntlets, a deafening chorus that shattered into wild laughter. But within that insane glee, the faces of the Andiian warriors were expressionless. And with solemn salutes they acknowledged their lord’s command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHust Legion, we never saw you again .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Eleint stopped coming .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHust Legion, how many did you kill on that other side? How many bones lie in heaps upon that alien plain? There at the gate? I can almost … almost see them, a felled forest of bones .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now shadows slide over them, shadows from the sky .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnomander Rake, ‘for ever’ was a lie. But you knew that. You were just buying time. Thinking we would ready ourselves for the next invasion. Did we? Did anyone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then, a suspicion whispers in my skull. You made her face us once again. Well, not us. Me .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKilled yourself a dragon, did you, Yedan Derryg?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeel up to a thousand more?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithal knew he was dreaming. The Meckros city where he had been born was nothing like this, a place of smoky dark quartzite and walls sheathed in mica and anthracite, and even as the groaning rise and fall beneath his feet told him the city was indeed floating on unseen seas, beyond the canted avenue lining the high sea wall on his left he could see nothing. No stars above, no cresting foam below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCordage creaked, the only sounds surrounding him. The city was abandoned, and he was alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Mortal. She will not listen. She is lost in ages past .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked round, and then grunted, irritated with himself. She was the Goddess of Dark. What else would he see of her, if not this empty abyss on all sides? ‘And me, an island city, untethered and unanchored and caught on unknown currents. Mael knows, Withal, even your dreams lack the subtle touch.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-222.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
