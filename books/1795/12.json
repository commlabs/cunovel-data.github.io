Can’t wait to see how it plays out.” Pamela’s eyes gleamed behind the lenses of her glasses. “And just think, the whole town will be watching.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m glad everyone else finds this mess so amusing.” Hannah glanced at the menu and saw that it hadn’t changed in eight years, either. It still featured the same eclectic but curiously inspired assortment of vegetarian burgers, French fries, pizzas, quesadillas, and noodle dishes. “I can assure you that from where I’m sitting, there’s nothing remotely entertaining about it. Rafe made it clear this afternoon that he’s going to be a problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He always was a problem, as I recall.” Pamela propped her elbows on the yellow Formica tabletop and rested her chin on her folded hands. “So, tell me. Has he changed much?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. He’s driving a Porsche these days instead of a motorcycle, but as far as I can tell, he still has no visible means of support.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah looked up sharply from the menu. “What does ‘hmm’ mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s been some talk that he might have been dabbling in a few less-than-legal activities during the past eight years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great. You think I’m sharing Aunt Isabel’s inheritance with a gangster?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No one’s really sure, you understand. But you’ve got to admit, the Porsche is a little hard to explain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah thought about that for a few seconds. “Well, one thing’s for certain. Whatever he’s been up to in the past few years, he still views me as a prissy overachiever. Not exactly the basis for a lasting relationship.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who’s talking duration?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I refuse to allow you to live out your prurient fantasies vicariously through me, Pam.” Hannah sighed. “I guess I’ll know soon enough whether or not he’s changed. If he starts spending his evenings down at the Total Eclipse, I’ll get a very big clue, won’t I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d say that would be a hint, yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s change the subject.” Hannah dropped the menu on the table. “Brad and the kids?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The kids are great.” Pamela’s eyes softened and lit up with enthusiasm. “I promised them you’d come to dinner soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be there with bells on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And Brad? Did he get that joint appointment at the institute yet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePamela’s smile faded. “We thought we were going to have some excellent news on that front to announce later this month. But now we’re not so sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something go wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You could say that. The something is named Perry Decatur. As far as we can tell, he’s the one blocking the appointment. He’s been jealous of Brad for years. Probably afraid that if Brad joins the staff at the institute, he’ll be put in the shade.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah sat back in surprise. “I didn’t know Perry worked at the institute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought I told you. He left his position at Chamberlain six months ago. His title is Vice President of Finance and Administration. Brings in big donors. Everyone assumes he’s got his eye on becoming director one of these days.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah shook her head in wry disgust. “Perry always was a fast talker.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never thought you’d come back here for good.” Jed Steadman sat forward in the wicker chair and clasped his hands lightly between his knees. “Figured that with the way things were between you and your grandfather, you’d want to stay clear of Eclipse Bay as much as possible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRafe stacked his feet on the railing, rocked back in his chair, and took a swallow of beer from the bottle he had brought from the kitchen. “One thing I’ve learned in the past eight years: Never say never.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hear you.” Jed watched a seagull ride a current of air above the cliffs. “Life takes some twists and turns sometimes. I thought I’d be long gone by now myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s right. Your big plan was to get a job as a foreign correspondent with one of the big-city dailies. What happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A man has to be flexible or he’ll miss out on some incredible opportunities. When Ed Bolton said he would sell the Journal to me a few years ago, I jumped at the chance. As editor and owner, I get to run my own show.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A lot to be said for that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You got that right.” Jed slanted him a sidelong glance. “Judging by the Porsche outside, you’ve done okay for yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRafe took another swallow of beer. “Managed to stay out of jail.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJed gave a short bark of laughter. “Almost forgot. Not doing time behind bars was your big career objective, wasn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRafe raised the beer bottle in a mocking salute. “And here I am today, a resounding success in my chosen field. A lesson for wayward youth across this great land.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Exactly what is your chosen field?” Jed’s eyes glinted with curiosity. “No offense, but I never heard that you ever actually got yourself what folks like to call a real job.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I get by.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve noticed.” Jed watched him intently. “There’s talk going around that you maybe found some, shall we say, unconventional ways to accomplish that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re starting to sound like a reporter, Jed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJed held up his hands, palms out. “Okay, I get the point. No more questions in that area. Can’t blame me for asking. I am in the newspaper business, after all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sat in companionable silence for a few minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Heard you and Connie split up a couple of years ago,” Rafe said eventually. “Sorry.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-1/page-12.html","bookId":1795,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:19:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:19:58 PM"}
