I’m totally going to hit him up for a recommendation . . . if Mike and I are still together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, I don’t know if cuff links are his specialty,” Spencer said, biting down hard on the inside of her cheek. She had a feeling this was going to be a long night. Hopefully Chase wouldn’t want to chat with any of her friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThinking of Chase, she pulled out her phone, leaned over Hanna, and showed her the picture he’d given her of Ali at The Preserve. “Look.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna’s lips were pursed. “Where did you get this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been digging up stuff about her. You know where this is, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Duh. I’d know that dayroom anywhere.” Hanna’s brow furrowed. “Ali looks about our age, maybe a little younger.” She pointed at the figure whose face they couldn’t see. “Who’s that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was hoping you’d know. He’s with Ali, don’t you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna squinted. “Too bad he’s not wearing something distinctive. Everyone and their mother has a black hoodie, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Noel has a black hoodie,” Spencer said, coughing awkwardly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna gave Spencer a long, serious look. “It does seem like him, doesn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want it to be.” Spencer sank to the bed and rubbed her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But it seems like it, doesn’t it?” Hanna asked softly. Hanna had told Spencer about how Mike didn’t remember where Noel had been when the bomb went off on the cruise . . . and about how she’d seen Noel at the Bill Beach. She shook her head. “And I still can’t believe you went into that apartment building in Philly by yourself. You could have been killed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think A just wanted to scare me,” Spencer mumbled, her stomach churning. It all seemed so obvious now: Ali and her helper had planted that address in the CVS system for Chase to find. They’d rigged the trapdoor to fall when Spencer snooped around. So did that mean A knew Spencer was snooping?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer leaned into the mirror and blotted a bit of smeared eye shadow on her temple. “I wish I could go back to that building, but I’m way too scared.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would you want to go back?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because even if that’s not where Ali’s private nurse lives, Ali and her helper have been there, booby-trapping the place. And now that the trap has been sprung, there’s a chance they’d go back and collect all the stuff they’d planted in that attic. Maybe that bowling ball is Noel’s dad’s. Maybe something up there can be traced to Ali.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh.” Hanna slowly ran a brush through her hair. “I never thought about that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a theory Chase had raised. Spencer had begged him to go in her place today to see if Ali or her mysterious boyfriend showed up, but he couldn’t. He didn’t explain why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer laptop beeped as if on cue. Spencer had a new e-mail in her top secret account. She glanced at the screen, shielding it from Hanna with her hand. Looking forward to seeing you tonight, Britney, Chase wrote, adding a winking smiley face. And, by the way, I just found out something interesting about Alison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart started to pound. What?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother e-mail popped up. Don’t want to tell you online, Chase wrote. But I’ll see you soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer gritted her teeth. She glanced at the clock on the bedside table. Only three more hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was going to feel like an eternity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as dusk was falling, Spencer and Chase, who met her back at her house, walked hand in hand to the limo at the curb. As Chase held the door for her, she gave him a bashful smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You look amazing,” Chase said, kissing her cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer tried not to swoon. “You look great, too.” Chase’s tux fit him perfectly. He’d been so polite when he’d handed Spencer her corsage and posed for the pictures. Even Amelia, who wrinkled her nose at everything, had gawked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe limo turned out of the cul-de-sac and onto the country road toward Philadelphia. The front window was down just a little, blowing in the sweet-smelling spring air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even when Chase popped the cork of a bottle of champagne and handed Spencer a glass, she couldn’t relax. She turned to Chase. “Now that we’re alone, can you please tell me what you know about Alison?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase sipped from his champagne flute. “I got some interesting footage from a friend. It’s a surveillance video from a building not far from here. There’s a girl in one of the shots who looks like Alison.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer’s skin prickled. “You’re kidding.” She glanced at Chase’s phone, which was on his lap. “Do you have it on you? Can we watch?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase stared at his phone, too. “I don’t have it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” Spencer slumped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was that the only reason you came out with me tonight?” Chase’s voice was froggy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course not!” Spencer cried. “I just . . . well, that sounds huge. I’d love to see it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her hand. “This is huge too, though. Being with you, I mean. I just want a calm, normal night, one where we don’t talk about Ali or stalkers or the shitty things that have happened to us. One where, like, you don’t almost die from something falling on your head.” He tried to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer blinked. “But . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How about this.” Chase squeezed her hand. “How about I access the video after our first dance. That’s, what, an hour from now? I just want a little bit of time with this amazing girl I met named Spencer. Okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBubbles from the champagne fizzed in Spencer’s nose. She gazed at the blurry highway lights above them. When was the last time she’d just enjoyed something? Even the cruise, which was supposed to be relaxing, had been a horrible, stressful mess. And it was kind of nice to be thought of as just Spencer, a regular girl, not Spencer the Pretty Little Liar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As long as you promise to show me everything as soon as that first dance ends,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I promise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey shook on it. Chase rested his head on her shoulder. They looked out the window as the city of Philadelphia glittered on the horizon, and they started to talk. Spencer asked him about what his prom would have been like, and who he would have liked to have taken, and what he was thinking about studying in college next year. Then they talked about her upcoming semester at Princeton. Spencer even told him a little about the huge mishap at the potluck party the weekend she’d visited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey talked the whole traffic-jammed ride into the city, and before Spencer knew it, they were taking the off-ramp near the zoo. Her pulse had slowed. Her cheeks hurt from laughing. Talking about everything but the case was a good suggestion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, as they stopped at a light, the driver turned on the radio. And now, turning to the murder investigation of Tabitha Clark. Investigators say they’ve made headway with their questioning and have several potential suspects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer dug her nails into her knee. Suspects?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That story is crazy, isn’t it?” Chase crossed his legs. “I’ve been following it a little. A few people have sent requests for me to post about it on my site.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh,” Spencer said, shakily pushing a lock of hair off her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase grabbed his champagne flute. “Actually, you were in Jamaica when Tabitha died, weren’t you? Did you see anything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer turned and stared at him, a cold feeling trickling down her back. “I never told you I was in Jamaica.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase blinked. “Yes, you did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I didn’t.” She started to shake all over. “I definitely didn’t.” It had been scary enough to admit who she really was. She wasn’t stupid enough to tell him about Jamaica on top of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase drained his flute in one sip, his eyes not leaving hers for a second. His Adam’s apple rose and fell as he swallowed. Slowly, he reached into his pocket for something. It was the same way someone threatened might reach for a knife, a gun. An entirely new reality formed in Spencer’s mind. What if Chase knew Spencer was in Jamaica because he had been there, too?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, Spencer’s blood went cold and the whole horrible scheme clicked into place. How easy it had been to find his conspiracy theory blog. How willing Chase had been to feed her all those details about Ali, secrets no one could just happen upon. Those pictures he’d shown her were obviously from a private collection, too, not randomly mailed to him. And Chase was brilliant at hacking into computer systems, which meant he could have easily planted information on Naomi Zeigler’s laptop on the cruise, Billy Ford’s laptop, and the CVS system. If that address was even in the CVS system. Spencer had just taken his word for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d been the one who’d taken her to the booby-trapped apartment. And then he’d fallen against that door, knocking on it. He’d made it out to be an accident, but what if it hadn’t been? Had he known that trapdoor was going to fall? Did he somehow trigger it to open with that knock? Or was it a signal to someone inside?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould Chase be Ali’s secret boyfriend? The other A? All this time, the girls had thought it was Noel . . . and she’d fallen right into Real Ali’s trap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer’s hand inched toward the door handle. Suddenly, Chase clamped down on her other wrist and pulled her toward him. His eyes blazed. His happy smile was gone. “There’s something I need to tell you,” he said sternly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I . . .” Spencer trembled. She pointed at something out the window. “What’s that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase released her wrist and looked. Spencer twisted to the handle and wrenched the door open. By the time Chase realized the trick, she was on the pavement. A cold breeze zipped up her skirt. Her heel turned on the sidewalk, but she kept going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Spencer!” Chase called. “What are you doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to scramble out of the car, too. Spencer yelped and kicked the door with her heel, slamming it in his face. The light turned green. Cars behind the limo honked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go!” Spencer screamed at the driver, who looked freaked out. Amazingly, the limo did go. Spencer turned and ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe zigzagged past a couple walking hand in hand and into an alleyway. This was in a part of the city she didn’t know well at all. No cabs passed. People sat on their stoops, glaring. Kids disappeared around a corner, their charged laughter spiraling through the alleyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed for the burner phone, the only one she’d brought tonight. Maybe she could call a cab. The screen was already blinking. When she saw the jumbled letters and numbers in the sender line, her heart dropped to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can run, but you can’t hide, Spence! Kisses, A\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer phone beeped again. It was the same text. And then the same text again, and then again, jamming her phone until an alert warned that her phone had run out of memory. Spencer switched to the call function, but a new message appeared: OUT OF BATTERY. POWERING OFF.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screen went dark. The sky seemed to darken around her, too, the shadows deepening. Spencer was cut off. A had won again. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crushed-pretty-little-liars-13/page-30.html","bookId":2389,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:24:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:24:21 AM"}
