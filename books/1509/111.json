The Four Divine Monarchs?

King of Hell, Hades. Lord of Thunder, Zeus. And King of the Seas, Poseidon. Our boss is Zeus, obviously. Just now, that was Poseidon. With the boss injured he’s probably here to help look after him. Prometheus, who came the other day, is the boss’ brother, but these two have a much different relationship. Back before, when they were fighting shoulder to shoulder, he apparently took a serious injury for the boss to keep him safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see. I had no idea that was Poseidon! He really is so good looking! But I still think our boss is better. More manly!” Ke’er nodded resolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiuxiu covered her mouth and stifled a giggle. “Is this supposed to be a compliment? You don’t call him handsome, just ‘manly.’ I doubt the boss would applaud the choice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I-I’m off to speak with the Wine Master,” Ke’er stuttered, leaving in a hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Ke’er left, Xiuxiu’s smile faltered and slipped away.

You should be afraid you’ll be the only one to love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHua Li fixed his friend with a penetrating stare. “No. I also have your love.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Garbage!” Lan Jue shot a foot out at Hua Li, but his saucy friend deftly slithered out of the way.

So which one was it, really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHua Li’s figure vanished in a flash, free from Lin Guoguo’s evil clutches. He hissed at her, teeth grinding. “I’m all natural!
