It was, in any case, hard to talk to Brother Nhumrod, who had a nervous habit of squinting at the speaker\u0027s lips and repeating the last few words they said practically as they said them. He also touched things all the time-walls, furniture, people-as if he was afraid the universe would disappear if he didn\u0027t keep hold of it. And he had so many nervous tics that they had to queue. Brother Nhumrod was perfectly normal for someone who had survived in the Citadel for fifty years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well . . .” Brutha began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother Nhumrod held up a skinny hand. Brutha could see the pale blue veins in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I am sure you know that there are two kinds of voice that are heard by the spiritual,” said the master of novices. One eyebrow began to twitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, master. Brother Murduck told us that,” said Brutha, meekly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“-told us that. Yes. Sometimes, as He in His infinite wisdom sees fit, the God speaks to a chosen one and he becomes a great prophet,” said Nhumrod. “Now, I am sure you wouldn\u0027t presume to consider yourself one of them? Mmm?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, master.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“-master. But there are other voices,” said Brother Nhumrod, and now his voice had a slight tremolo, “beguiling and wheedling and persuasive voices, yes? Voices that are always waiting to catch us off our guard?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha relaxed. This was more familiar ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the novices knew about those kinds of voices. Except that usually they talked about fairly straightforward things, like the pleasures of night-time manipulation and the general desirability of girls. Which showed that they were novices when it came to voices. Brother Nhumrod got the kind of voices that were, by comparison, a full oratorio. Some of the bolder novices liked to get Brother Nhumrod talking on the subject of voices. He was an education, they said. Especially when little bits of white spit appeared at the corners of his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha listened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother Nhumrod was the novice master, but he wasn\u0027t the novice master. He was only master of the group that included Brutha. There were others. Possibly someone in the Citadel knew how many there were. There was someone somewhere whose job it was to know everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Citadel occupied the whole of the heart of the city of Kom, in the lands between the deserts of Klatch and the plains and jungles of Howondaland. It extended for miles, its temples, churches, schools, dormitories, gardens, and towers growing into and around one another in a way that suggested a million termites all trying to build their mounds at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the sun rose the reflection of the doors of the central Temple blazed like fire. They were bronze, and a hundred feet tall. On them, in letters of gold set in lead, were the Commandments. There were five hundred and twelve so far, and doubtless the next prophet would add his share.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun\u0027s reflected glow shone down and across the tens of thousands of the strong-in-faith who labored below for the greater glory of the Great God Om.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably no one did know how many of them there were. Some things have a way of going critical. Certainly there was only one Cenobiarch, the Superior Iam. That was certain. And six Archpriests. And thirty lesser Iams. And hundreds of bishops, deacons, subdeacons, and priests. And novices like rats in a grain store. And craftsmen, and bull breeders, and torturers, and Vestigial Virgins . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter what your skills, there was a place for you in the Citadel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if your skill lay in asking the wrong kinds of questions or losing the righteous kind of wars, the place might just be the furnaces of purity, or the Quisition\u0027s pits of justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA place for everyone. And everyone in their place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun beat down on the temple garden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Great God Om tried to stay in the shade of a melon vine. He was probably safe here, here inside these walls and with the prayer towers all around, but you couldn\u0027t be too careful. He\u0027d been lucky once, but it was asking too much to expect to be lucky again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trouble with being a god is that you\u0027ve got no one to pray to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crawled forward purposefully towards the old man shoveling muck until, after much exertion, he judged himself to be within earshot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spake thusly: “Hey, you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no answer. There was not even any suggestion that anything had been heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOm lost his temper and turned Lu-Tze into a lowly worm in the deepest cesspit of hell, and then got even more angry when the old man went on peacefully shoveling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The devils of infinity fill your living bones with sulphur!” he screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis did not make a great deal of difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Deaf old bugger,” muttered the Great God Om.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr perhaps there was someone who did know all there was to be known about the Citadel. There\u0027s always someone who collects knowledge, not because of a love of the stuff but in the same way that a magpie collects glitter or a caddis fly collects little bits of twigs and rock. And there\u0027s always someone who has to do all those things that need to be done but which other people would rather not do or, even, acknowledge existed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third thing the people noticed about Vorbis was his height. He was well over six feet tall, but stickthin, like a normal proportioned person modeled in clay by a child and then rolled out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second thing that people noticed about Vorbis was his eyes. His ancestors had come from one of the deep desert tribes that had evolved the peculiar trait of having dark eyes?-not just dark of pupil, but almost black of eyeball. It made it very hard to tell where he was looking. It was as if he had sunglasses on under his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the first thing they noticed was his skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeacon Vorbis was bald by design. Most of the Church\u0027s ministers, as soon as they were ordained, cultivated long hair and beards that you could lose a goat in. But Vorbis shaved all over. He gleamed. And lack of hair seemed to add to his power. He didn\u0027t menace. He never threatened. He just gave everyone the feeling that his personal space radiated several meters from his body, and that anyone approaching Vorbis was intruding on something important. Superiors fifty years his senior felt apologetic about interrupting whatever it was he was thinking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was almost impossible to know what he was thinking about and no one ever asked. The most obvious reason for this was that Vorbis was the head of the Quisition, whose job it was to do all those things that needed to be done and which other people would rather not do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou do not ask people like that what they are thinking about in case they turn around very slowly and say “You.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe highest post that could be held in the Quisition was that of deacon, a rule instituted hundreds of years ago to prevent this branch of the Church becoming too big for its boots.[2] But with a mind like his, everyone said, he could easily be an archpriest by now, or even an Iam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVorbis didn\u0027t worry about that kind of trivia. Vorbis knew his destiny. Hadn\u0027t the God himself told him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There,” said Brother Nhumrod, patting Brutha on the shoulder. “I\u0027m sure you will see things clearer now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrutha felt that a specific reply was expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, master,” he said. “I\u0027m sure I shall.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“-shall. It is your holy duty to resist the voices at all times,” said Nhumrod, still patting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, master. I will. Especially if they tell me to do any of the things you mentioned.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“-mentioned. Good. Good. And if you hear them again, what will you do? Mmm?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come and tell you,” said Brutha, dutifully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“-tell you. Good. Good. That\u0027s what I like to hear,” said Nhumrod. “That\u0027s what I tell all my boys. Remember that I\u0027m always here to deal with any little problems that may be bothering you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, master. Shall I go back to the garden now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“-now. I think so. I think so. And no more voices, d\u0027you hear?” Nhumrod waved a finger of his nonpatting hand. A cheek puckered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, master.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What were you doing in the garden?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hoeing the melons, master,” said Brutha.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Melons? Ah. Melons,” said Nhumrod slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Melons. Melons. Well, that goes some way toward explaining things, of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn eyelid flickered madly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t just the Great God that spoke to Vorbis, in the confines of his head. Everyone spoke to an exquisitor, sooner or later. It was just a matter of stamina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVorbis didn\u0027t often go down to watch the inquisitors at work these days. Exquisitors didn\u0027t have to. He sent down instructions, he received reports. But special circumstances merited his special attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt has to be said . . . there was little to laugh at in the cellar of the Quisition. Not if you had a normal sense of humor. There were no jolly little signs saying: You Don\u0027t Have To Be Pitilessly Sadistic To Work Here But It Helps!!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there were things to suggest to a thinking man that the Creator of mankind had a very oblique sense of fun indeed, and to breed in his heart a rage to storm the gates of heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mugs, for example. The inquisitors stopped work twice a day for coffee. Their mugs, which each man had brought from home, were grouped around the kettle on the hearth of the central furnace which incidentally heated the irons and knives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had legends on them like A Present From the Holy Grotto of Ossory, or To The World\u0027s Greatest Daddy. Most of them were chipped, and no two of them were the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there were the postcards on the wall. It was traditional that, when an inquisitor went on holiday, he\u0027d send back a crudely colored woodcut of the local view with some suitably jolly and risque message on the back. And there was the pinned-up tearful letter from Inquisitor First Class Ishmale “Pop” Quoom,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethanking all the lads for collecting no fewer than seventy?eight obols for his retirement present and the lovely bunch of flowers for Mrs. Quoom, indicating that he\u0027d always remember his days in No. 3 pit, and was looking forward to coming in and helping out any time they were short-handed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it all meant this: that there are hardly any excesses of the most crazed psychopath that cannot easily be duplicated by a normal, kindly family man who just comes in to work every day and has a job to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVorbis loved knowing that. A man who knew that, knew everything he needed to know about people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently he was sitting alongside the bench on which lay what was still, technically, the trembling body of Brother Sasho, formerly his secretary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up at the duty inquisitor, who nodded. Vorbis leaned over the chained secretary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What were their names?” he repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“. . . don\u0027t know . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know you gave them copies of my correspondence, Sasho. They are treacherous heretics who will spend eternity in the hells. Will you join them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“. . . don\u0027t know names . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I trusted you, Sasho. You spied on me. You betrayed the Church.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“. . . no names . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Truth is surcease from pain, Sasho. Tell me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“. . . truth . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVorbis sighed. And then he saw one of Sasho\u0027s fingers curling and uncurling under the manacles. Beckoning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned closer over the body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSasho opened his one remaining eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“. . .truth . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“. . .
