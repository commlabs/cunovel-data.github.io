The only time I left was to see our boy—and he’s right next door.” Jake tilts his head to the right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s right through there. There’s only a wall separating me from my son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want…see him,” I force out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, sweetheart.” He strokes my cheek with his thumb. “But I think I should get Kish now that you’re fully awake to let him check you over. Your mom and dad—I should call them and let them know you’re properly awake now. They’re waiting over at the hotel. They’ll want to see you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I want to see my son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” I shake my head. Shit, that hurts. “I want…him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake smiles, and this time it’s a real honest-to-God Jake smile. The smile he reserves for me only, and I couldn’t be more relieved to see it right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” he concedes. “How could I ever say no to you? I’ll get him now and bring him through.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake leans down and presses his lips gently to mine. “I missed you so much,” he whispers over my lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he leaves the room, leaving me alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence hits me immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was in a car accident that resulted in my son’s being born while I was unconscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI missed his birth. I’ve missed the first week of his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve missed those important first moments. The moments when a mother bonds with her child and he bonds with her. They were taken away from me. I can’t ever get them back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if I can’t bond with him now? What if he rejects me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn’t understand why I’ve not been with him for the start of his life. To him, I’ll be a stranger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe don’t know each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do I say—do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know he’s only a baby and won’t understand what I’m saying, but these first moments between us now are crucial, and I’m lying in a bed, struggling to move and in pain every time I speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate that I haven’t been here for him. I hate that this is how I’m meeting my son for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was not how I imagined it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI imagined my baby being handed to me, holding him in my arms. Giving him to Jake to hold for the first time. Watching as Jake had his first moments with our son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot having my child pulled from me while I was unconscious and Jake was on his way to the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLoss for what should have been ours overwhelms me. Visions of what happened form in my mind, forcing fresh tears to my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy son was born alone, surrounded by strangers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m just so thankful he’s had Jake with him ever since.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it makes my heart hurt that Jake has had to cope with this alone—take care of me and become a dad all on his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t even imagine how Jake felt when he was told what happened. If it were him, I know it would have killed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know without a doubt that Jake and our son will have bonded, and I am so happy for that. I’m just afraid he won’t bond with me, that he might reject me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know how I will cope with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now instead of being excited to meet my son, I’m terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear the door open, then the squeak of wheels and two sets of feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body starts to tremble, my heart beats erratically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes, afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t think I can do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Put him over by the bed,” I hear Jake say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe squeaky wheels grow ever closer. Then they stop and I hear the sound of a plug being put it in the socket, a switch being turned on, and the gentle hum of a machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Give me a holler when you want a hand bringing him back through,” I hear a female voice say. Then the door closes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel the bed dip as Jake sits down by my legs. “Tru.” His voice is soft. “Are you awake?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know I made him get the baby, but now I’m scared. I hesitate, actually considering faking sleep, and immediately hate myself for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Open your eyes.” His voice is still soft, but there’s a quiet command in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a burning breath, I whisper, “I’m…afraid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear a light sigh escape Jake. He takes my hand in his. I curl my fingers around his hand. “I know, baby…” I can tell he’s talking from experience. “But I promise, one look at him, Tru…that’s all it takes. Trust me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I do. I open my eyes and turn my head to the side. There he is, in an incubator pushed up against the side of my bed. I see him, and it’s love at first sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is beautiful. The most beautiful thing I have ever seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t remember ever feeling a love like this before. It’s equally as powerful as the love I feel for Jake, but so very different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA mother’s love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, I can see so much of Jake in him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe has the same furrow Jake has in his brow when he’s sleeping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny worries of not bonding with him are gone. I just love him, completely. And I start to cry instantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake squeezes my hand. “Hey, don’t cry. He’s okay in there, really. It’s just keeping him warm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake thinks I’m crying because I’m worried that’s he’s in an incubator. Of course I’m concerned about the incubator, but that’s not why I’m crying right now. I’m crying because I’m happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why don’t you touch him?” Jake suggests. “That might make you feel better. It helped me the first time I saw him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start to free my hand from Jake’s when he says, “Hang on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake releases my hand and disappears into the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s then for the first time that I notice the tubes taped to my arm. I follow them up and see them attached to two different drips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance at my right arm and see a cast covering it, my hand swaddled in bandage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake said I hurt my head in the accident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lift my good hand to it and feel a thick bandage on my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just need to clean your hand before you touch him,” Jake tells me, reappearing with a bottle of gel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile at him. He sounds so responsible. In a way, he sounds like my dad would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s because he is a dad. He’s had over a week learning how to be one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday is my first day as a mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForcing back a wave of fresh tears, I chance a quick glance at Jake and see him squeeze some gel out and rub it over his hands. Then he squeezes another blob into his hand, sits back down on the bed, takes my hand in his, and starts gently working the gel into my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s cold on my skin, but Jake soon warms me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re good to go.” He smiles, giving my hand one last rub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grin at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking my hand from his, I slowly put it through the porthole, keeping my eyes on my baby boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant my fingertips touch the soft downy skin on his tiny hand, sensations explode under my skin, tunnelling straight for my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could spend forever here with him like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have so many questions about him that I want to ask Jake, but I don’t think my throat will hold out, so I ask the important one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Name?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake shakes his head, smiling gently. “I haven’t named him. I was waiting for you. That honour is all yours, Tru.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart crumbles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at my son, thinking of all the names I had come up with…all the ones Jake hated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He still like…rock songs?” I grate out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA small chuckle escapes Jake. “Yeah, I sing to him a lot—the old favourites. I think we might have a mini–rock star on our hands.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, smiling. A rock star needs a rock star’s name, right? A smile curves my lips. “I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake gives me a suspicious look, humour in his eyes. “It’s something crazy, isn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I croak out, giving him an affronted look. “I thought…” I pause, swallowing through the burning. “Jonathan Jacob.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look on Jake’s face right now is beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re giving him Jonny’s name?” I watch him gulp down the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake bends close and gently kisses my lips. “I love it. I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Love you,” I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom out of nowhere our little boy curls his fingers around my little finger, the one that was still gently stroking his skin, gripping tightly for his small size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh softly in surprise, turning to look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He does that a lot, he likes to hold on to your finger,” Jake tells me, running his own fingers along the crook of my arm. “I think he likes his name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah?” I smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah…” Moving away, Jake walks around the bed, kicks his shoes off, and carefully climbs onto the space beside me. Lying on his side, his head on the pillow, he says into my ear, “I missed you so much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis breath tickles my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn my face to him and he leans in and kisses me softly on the lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning from Jake, I move my gaze back to my son. I’m finding it hard not to look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake’s arm goes across my waist. “He looks like you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, like you.” Beautiful like you, Jake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs softly. “No, he definitely looks like you. Everyone agrees with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone agrees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone else got to see my baby before I did. Sadness pokes at my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrushing over my sadness, I shake my head in disagreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake chuckles, then presses his lips to the skin between my neck and shoulder blade. It tickles down my spine; even the parts of me that are in pain shiver with delight at the feel of Jake’s lips on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s got your lips and your colouring,” Jake says against my skin, still kissing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This…gonna go on for…while,” I force out, giving him a quick look, eyes smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Forever,” he replies, and I know he’s not talking about the disagreement anymore. Burying his face into my neck, he takes a ragged breath. “I love you so much, Tru. Thank you for coming back to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI press my cheek against the top of his head. “I…always will.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tightens his hold on me. That’s how we stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJake’s holding on to me, and I’m holding on to our son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three of us are together, and nothing is ever going to keep us apart again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s been three months since the accident. Three months since my beautiful son, JJ, was born.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe called him Jonathan Jacob for a day, and then Jake shortened it to JJ, and that’s what everyone has been calling him since.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spent just over two months in the hospital recovering. Initially it was bed rest, letting myself heal. Then I started daily physiotherapy once my arm and hand had healed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also saw a counsellor twice a week. Dr. Kish recommended it. I may not remember the actual accident, but he said I’d been though a terrible trauma, and while I might not remember it on the surface, it’s still buried deep within me. Talking about the accident with someone would help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went through phases of emotions. One day I’d be on top of the world, feeling extremely lucky to be alive, knowing I could have died. Then the next day, I would be angry. Angry this had happened to me. Angry I had missed the birth of my son. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wethering-the-storm-the-storm-2/page-43.html","bookId":1999,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:31:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:31:55 PM"}
