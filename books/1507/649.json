Everyone on the island, including the Cultivators of the Footloose Sect, could hear him clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir faces all flickered with various emotions. The people near the battlefield didn’t dare to get too close. Their expressions were that of shock, and they were panting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Meng Hao? Who’s that? It sounds like he’s really important in the Footloose Sect!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What kind of person would the Patriarch risk his life to protect? He must be the hope of the whole Footloose Sect! He can’t die!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Meng Hao? I remember! He was an Inner Sect disciple of the Reliance Sect! The Patriarch was right! He’s the highest ranking member of our Sect next to the Patriarch!” The astonished Cultivators immediately committed Patriarch Reliance’s words to heart, engraving them there to remember always.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, Patriarch Reliance’s words were filled with such realistic emotion that even he was starting to believe them. Tears appeared in his eyes as he roared out. It was at this point that the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch stopped in mid-air, his eyes wide with shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why aren’t you chasing him?” said Patriarch Reliance, blinking. He was now far larger than the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch, and had inserted himself between him and Meng Hao. He glared angrily. “Kill me, and then you can pass!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatriarch Reliance was now fully immersed in the game. To him, it was actually quite fun, and when he spoke, his voice burst with incredible power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With me here, nobody can hurt Meng Hao!” roared Patriarch Reliance. Of course, inwardly, he was laughing. He wanted the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch to strike him down as quickly as possible, and then go take care of the little bastard. Then he himself would finally be freed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch didn’t seem to have any intention of chasing Meng Hao. From his perspective, there was no way for Meng Hao to truly escape; he would catch him sooner or later. However, the Demon beast in front of him was something quite rare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, it was rare enough that the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch couldn’t possibly let it go!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What an incredible, loyal Demon beast,” he said slowly. “In all my life, I’ve never seen anything like it!” The admiration in his eyes grew stronger as he looked at Patriarch Reliance, nodding and smiling. “For a Demon beast like this to follow that child is a real pity. Demon turtle, I am the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch. Are you willing to be my follower? If so, then from now on, you will be the Divine Beast Dao Protector of the Wang Clan!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The day I achieve Immortal Ascension, I will bring you with me into the Heavens!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao was just about to press down on the good luck charm when he heard the words of the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch. He stopped in place and looked back. When he saw the scene, and especially the trembling Patriarch Reliance, he wanted to laugh out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew Patriarch Reliance, and that he most valued his freedom. In order to get rid of Meng Hao, Patriarch Reliance might be able to forget about some other matters, but as for his freedom… talking about that was one good way to really piss him off!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never imagined it would play out this way,” thought Meng Hao. “But I like it. Come on, be a bit more realistic, you old turtle. Keep up the act, I want to see more!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatriarch Reliance stared with wide eyes for a moment, and then his heart began to pound. He felt like he was about to explode; madness suddenly surged through his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you just say? What did you call me?” He almost couldn’t believe that someone would try to turn him into a guard beast. Actually, this was the second time such a humiliation had occurred to him since he grew up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first time had been at the hands of the League of Demon Sealers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Patriarch Reliance, the level of irritation this caused him exceeded anything else in the world. His body began to tremble and distort, and it was only because of the little bit of rationality left that he was able to suppress his rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not pleased, little Demon turtle?” said the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch, his face sinking. He had offered this Demon turtle a rare, moving opportunity. Normally speaking, considering his temper, he would have just instantly killed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fudge! YOU’RE the Demon turtle!” roared Patriarch Reliance. “Everyone in your whole Wang Clan are all Demon turtles, and you’re the bastard son of a turtle! Do you really dare to try to make me your security guard!?!?!” Moments later, though, he inwardly urged himself to just hold on a little bit longer. All he had to do was hold on, and then great good fortune would come his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy this point, though, his body had grown incredibly blurry. Furthermore, his real body was actually trembling some, causing huge waves to surge out on the sea, along with echoing rumbling sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, it’s beyond your control,” said the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch, his voice cool. “If you’re willing, good. If you’re not willing, it doesn’t matter. When I make a decision, nobody can change it. I’ll put some restrictive spells on you, and then from now on, you’ll be the Demon turtle of my Wang Clan!” Apparently, he felt his own words to be the will of Heaven, like laws and statutes that couldn’t be broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao was going wild with joy, and almost started laughing out loud. He knew that currently, he could leave at any time he wished. Besides, if Patriarch Reliance couldn’t endure through all this, then Meng Hao didn’t mind facing a bit of danger just to be able to see that happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch spoke, he raised his right hand and performed an incantation. Instantly, thousands of restrictive spell symbols appeared in mid-air. They circulated around in the area to form a huge net, which then shot toward the illusory, turtle-form Patriarch Reliance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatriarch Reliance’s body was blurry, but it was still possible to see how furious he was. His panting sounded like explosions, and his fury… finally reached the point of detonation!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were wide; earlier, he had done everything he could to hold back his rage. But now, he couldn’t suppress even a tiny bit of it. In the blink of an eye… his fury exploded!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThunderous booming sounds echoed out in all directions as Patriarch Reliance lifted his head up and let out an unprecedented howl of rage!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“AAARRGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!” In this moment, he didn’t care about Meng Hao or the Demon Sealing Sect. All he cared about was the towering rage he felt from being offended in such a way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch overt humiliation made him think back to how he had felt being restricted by the League of Demon Sealers. It was like an old wound had been ripped open. Patriarch Reliance’s rage filled his mind, and he roared again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit! Dammit….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The League of Demon Sealers is one thing, but you, tiny child, you actually dare to humiliate the Patriarch!?!?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatriarch Reliance was so immersed in his rage that he completely forgot about the act from before. His eyes were bright red, and the entirety of Saint’s Island was shaking violently. The land quaked, as if some enormous creature were waking up beneath it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surrounding seawater was covered with massive, roaring waves, as if the sea in the area was about to explode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFar beneath Saint’s Island, deep in the blackness of the sea, something like two oil lamps suddenly appeared. They were bloodshot, and filled with madness, the madness instigated by old wounds being ripped open. It was a madness stemming from humiliation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBOOM!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuge fissures ripped open in the land. The sky grew dark, wild colors flashed about, and the sea raged. All of these sudden changes caused the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch’s face to fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, before he could even make a single move, an aura exploded up from deep within the sea. The aura was filled with intense rage, and as soon as it appeared, it caused even the air to be shredded. It seemed as if Saint’s Island were being ripped out from the very world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch sensed the aura, his face completely filled with shock. He immediately took a deep breath and then flew up into the air, his face pale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Immortal!!” he said, his voice faint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is the aura of an Immortal!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Demonic Qi like an Immortal. This is the will of a Demon Immortal!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA deep, growling voice could suddenly be heard from within the ground, causing the earth to shake and mountains to tremble. “You actually dare to call the Patriarch a Demon turtle? You actually dare try to make me your security guard!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice came up from the ground and from within the sea. The seawater churned and seethed and began to spin around Saint’s Island until it transformed into a huge vortex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You actually dare to try to put restrictive spells on me! Are you… worthy?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBOOM!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sea exploded up, causing water to shower about in all directions. A huge force seemed to shoot up into the sky, and at the same time, a gargantuan head became visible within the sheets of water. It stretched out to blot out the entire sky. Its shadow was so huge that it could obstruct both the sun and the moon. It covered over everything!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the colossal head of a vicious turtle, its skin covered with wrinkles. It was pitch black and terrifying, and when it opened its mouth, sharp, yellow teeth could be seen. And then there were the eyes, which seemed blurry at first, but then clearly radiated intense fury and rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was… the head of Patriarch Reliance’s real body!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn indescribable energy pulsed out from Patriarch Reliance. His aura emanated out, causing all living things to tremble with fear. Up in mid-air, the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch slowly forced himself to turn around. Then he saw the indescribably gigantic head filling the entire sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gaped, and his mind filled with a roaring sound. His eyes went wide, filled with an expression of astonished disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly understood why his opponent could so frivolously waste its essence. It was because, its essence… was incredibly, astonishingly vast….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You….” stammered the 10th Wang Clan Patriarch, his scalp going numb. For years, he had swept across Planet South Heaven, but he had never seen a shocking, terrifying Demon beast like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want the Patriarch to be your security guard?” raged Patriarch Reliance. The sound of his voice was like thunder, filled with madness. Countless mountains on Saint’s Island collapsed, and huge waves rolled out across the sea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Wang Clan Patriarch staggered backward several paces. Patriarch Reliance’s roar just now caused him to cough up a huge mouthful of blood. His face was pale white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanting, he thought back to what he had said about making his opponent a guard. Then he took a deep breath. Obviously, he had absolutely no qualifications whatsoever to try to make a Demon Immortal act as a guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Senior, please calm your anger,” he said quickly, continuing to back up. “This is all just a big misunderstanding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Misunderstanding my flipping ass!” roared Patriarch Reliance. The echo of his roar sounded back and forth, causing the sea itself to roar, making it sound like there were countless Patriarch Reliances all roaring at the same time. But then he said, “Allow the Patriarch to bestow you with some good fortune!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the second time that Meng Hao had seen Patriarch Reliance’s real body. It was as shocking now as it had been before. Suddenly, he thought back to how he had vented his spleen on Patriarch Reliance in the Demon Immortal Pagoda, and he felt a little scared. But then he remembered that he could restrain Patriarch Reliance with the Demon Sealing Scripture, and he felt a bit calmer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was at this point that Meng Hao heard the words ‘good fortune,’ and his eyes began to shine brightly. He quickly began to back up; he knew that now was the time for him to make his exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-----\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis chapter was sponsored by Tommy Tea, Brett Flowers, Beau Greene, Fabian Müller, and Stefica Hoff\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-5-chapter-645\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-5-chapter-647\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-5-chapter-646","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:26 AM"}
