And jackass. And dickhead. And bastar-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I get your point!\" he snaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hand is on the doorknob when he calls my name again. I pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I also want to say I\u0027m sorry-about last night,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn toward him as I speak. \"Are you sorry you let it happen? Or sorry about the way you stopped it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cocks his head and shrugs his shoulders as if he doesn\u0027t understand my question. \"All of it. It never should have happened.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bastard,\" I finish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe engine of my jeep purrs its\u0027 familiar sound when I crank it, and that pisses me off too. I slam my fist against the steering wheel, wishing so many things. I wish I never would have met Will the first week I was here. It would have been so much easier if I\u0027d have met him in class first. Or better yet, I wish we never would have even moved to Ypsilanti. I wish my dad were alive. I wish my mother wasn\u0027t being so vague about her errands. I wish Caulder wasn\u0027t at our house every day. Seeing him just makes me think of Will. I wish Will would never have fixed my jeep. I hate that he does considerate things like that. It would make it so much easier to hate him if he really was all those things I called him. Oh my god, I can\u0027t believe I called him all those names. Wait, no regrets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pick the boys up from school and drive home. I beat Will home today, but I won’t be waiting at the window. I’m done waiting at the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be at Caulder\u0027s,\" Kel yells as they slam the jeep door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I walk inside, I hear my mother talking to someone in her bedroom. I pause outside her door. It\u0027s a one-sided conversation so she must be on the phone. Normally, I would never eavesdrop on one of her conversations. However, her behavior lately warrants a little nosiness. Or maybe my behavior warrants a little rebellion. Either way, I cup my ear to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. I know. I\u0027ll tell them soon,\" she whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I think it will go over better if I tell them alone…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I will. I love you too, Babe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s signing off. I quietly tiptoe to my bedroom and slip inside. I shut the door behind me and slide to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven months now. It took her all of seven months to move on. She can\u0027t be seeing someone else already, but her words on the phone couldn\u0027t have been more clear. I\u0027m in stage one again: Denial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could she? And whoever he is, he already wants her to introduce us to him? I already don\u0027t like him. And her nerve! How could she accost Will like she did, when what she\u0027s doing is just as deplorable, if not worse? Stage one is extremely brief. I\u0027m back in stage two again: Anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decide not to bring it up right away. I want to find out more before I confront her about it. I want the upper hand in this situation, and it\u0027s going to take some thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lake? Are you back?\" She\u0027s knocking on my door. I have to roll forward and hop up to get out of the way when she opens it. She sees me stand and her eyebrows raise as she watches me jump up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stretching. My back hurts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn\u0027t buy it, so I clasp my hands behind me and stretch my arms upward, bending forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take some aspirin,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m off tonight, but I have a lot of sleep to catch up on. I didn\u0027t get any at all today so I\u0027m going to lie down. Can you make sure Kel gets a bath before he goes to bed tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both start down the hallway. \"Wait, Mom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turns back to me, her lids dragging over her bloodshot eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going out Thursday night. Is that okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe eyes me suspiciously. \"With who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eddie, Gavin and Nick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three guys? You aren\u0027t going anywhere with three guys.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Eddie\u0027s a girl. She\u0027s my friend. Her boyfriend is Gavin and we’re double dating. I\u0027m going with Nick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes brighten a little. \"Oh. Well, good.\" She smiles as she opens the door to her bedroom. \"Wait,\" she says. \"I work Thursday. What about Kel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will has a sitter on Thursdays. He already said Kel could stay there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks pleased, but only for a second. \"Will agreed to pay a sitter? To watch Kel? So you could go on a date?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrap. I didn\u0027t realize how this would look. \"Mom, it\u0027s been weeks. We went on one date, we\u0027re over it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe eyes me curiously. \"Hmm.\" She returns to her room, still unappeased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer suspicion brings me a small sense of gratification. She thinks I\u0027m lying about something. Now we\u0027re even.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to third period,\" I say to Eddie as we exit history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just don\u0027t feel like it. Headache. I think I\u0027ll go sit in the courtyard and get some fresh air.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugs as we start to part ways in the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Layken.\" She grabs my arm. \"Does it have anything to do with what happened at lunch? With Mr. Cooper? Is everything okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile at her reassuringly. \"No, it\u0027s fine. Mr. Cooper just wants me to refrain from my colorful choice of words in his class.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe purses her lips together and walks away with the same unappeased look my mother had last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe courtyard is empty. I guess none of the other students need a breather from the teacher they\u0027re secretly in love with. I sit at a bench and pull my phone out of my pocket. Nothing. I\u0027ve only spoken to Kerris once since I moved. She was the one friend in Texas I was closest to, but she was actually best friends with another girl. It\u0027s odd when your best friend has an even better best friend. I chalked it up to the fact that I was too busy for best friends, but maybe it was more than that. Maybe I\u0027m not a good listener. Maybe I\u0027m not a good sharer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mind if I join you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up as Eddie takes a seat on the bench across from me. \"Misery loves company,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Misery? And why are we miserable? You have a date to look forward to tomorrow night. And your best friend is me,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBest friend. Maybe. Hopefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t think Will is going to come looking for us?\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cocks her head at me. \"Will? You mean Mr. Cooper?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh god, I just called him Will. She\u0027s already suspicious. I smile and come up with the first excuse that pops into my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, Mr. Cooper. We called teachers by their first names at my last school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn\u0027t respond. She\u0027s picking at the paint on the bench with her blue fingernail. Nine of her fingernails are green, just the one is blue. \"I\u0027m just going to say something here,\" she says. Her voice is calmer. \"Maybe I\u0027m way off base, maybe I\u0027m not. But whatever I say, I don\u0027t want you to interject.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think what was happening at lunch yesterday was more than just a slap on the wrist for inappropriate verb usage. I don\u0027t know how much more, and honestly it\u0027s none of my business. I just want you to know you can talk to me. If you need to. I\u0027d never repeat anything, I don\u0027t have anyone besides Gavin to repeat stuff to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one? Best friends? Siblings?\" I hope this changes the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope. He\u0027s all I have,\" she says. \"Well, technically. If you want to know the truth, I\u0027ve had seventeen sisters, twelve brothers, six moms and seven dads.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t tell if she\u0027s making a joke, so I don\u0027t laugh in case she isn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Foster care,\" she says. \"I\u0027m on my seventh home in nine years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. I\u0027m sorry.\" I don\u0027t know what else to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be. I\u0027ve been with Joel for four of those nine years. He\u0027s my foster dad. It works. I\u0027m content. He gets his check.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were any of your twenty-nine sibling’s blood related?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughs. \"Man, you pay attention. And no, I\u0027m an only child. Born to a mother with a yearn for cheap crack and pricey babies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe can see I\u0027m not following.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She tried to sell me. Don\u0027t worry, nobody wanted me. Or she was just asking too much. When I was nine she offered me to a lady in a Wal-Mart parking lot. She gave her a sob story about how she couldn\u0027t take care of me, yada yada, offered the lady a deal. A hundred bucks was my going rate. It wasn’t the first time she tried this right in front of me. I was getting bored with it, so I looked right at the lady and said, \u0027You got a husband? I bet he’s hot!\u0027 My mother backhanded me for ruining the sale. Left me in the parking lot. The lady took me to the police station and dropped me off. That\u0027s the last time I ever saw my mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God, Eddie. That\u0027s unreal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, it is. But it\u0027s my real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lie down on the bench and look up at the sky. She does the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said Eddie was a family name,” I say. “Which family?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t laugh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what if I think it\u0027s funny?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolls her eyes. \"There was a comedy DVD my first foster family owned. Eddie Izzard. I thought I had his nose. I watched that DVD a million times, pretending he was my dad. I had people refer to me as Eddie after that. I tried Izzard for a while, but it never stuck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both laugh. I pull my jacket off and pull it on top of me, sliding my arms through it backwards so that it warms the parts of me that have been exposed to the cold for too long. I close my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had amazing parents,\" I sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Had?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dad died seven months ago. My mother moved us up here, claimed it was for financial reasons, but I\u0027m not so sure she was being honest now. She\u0027s seeing someone else already. So yes, amazing is past tense at the moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe both lie there pondering the hands we were dealt. Mine pales in comparison to hers. The things she must have seen. Kel is the same age now that Eddie was when she was put into foster care. I don’t know how she walks around so happy, so full of life. We\u0027re quiet. Everything is comfortably quiet. I silently wonder if this is what it feels like to have a best friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sits up on her bench after a while, hands stretched out in front of her as she yawns. “Earlier, the thing I said about Joel-and me being a check to him? It’s not like that. He’s really been a great guy. Sometimes when things get too real, my sarcasm takes over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile at her in understanding. \"Thanks for skipping with me, I really needed it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for needing it. Apparently, I did too. And about Nick? He’s a good guy, just not for you. I’ll drop it. But you still have to go with us tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know I do. If I don’t, Chuck Norris will hunt me down and kick my ass.” I flip my jacket around and ease my arms in as we walk through the door and back into the hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So if Eddie is something you made up, what\u0027s your real name?\" I ask her before we part ways. She smiles and shrugs her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right now, it’s Eddie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wanna have friends\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat will let me be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll alone when being alone\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eis all that I need.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-The Avett Brothers, The Perfect Space\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Eight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s mom?” I ask Kel.
