Now that the chase was drawing to a conclusion, she was finally going to get some answers. She found herself drawing back, afraid to hear them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly rang the doorbell. The moment the door opened and she saw Sam Meadows, her fears went away. All she felt was pleasure and relief at seeing this man who had been so close to Mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kelly!\" He cradled her in a warm bear hug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Sam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her hand. \"Come on in.\" Kelly stepped inside. It was a charming two-bedroom apartment, in a building that had once belonged to a member of the French nobility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drawing room was spacious and luxuriously appointed with French furniture, and in a small alcove, there was a curiously carved oak bar. On the wall was a Man Ray, and Adolf Wolfli drawings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t tell you how devastated I am about Mark,\" Sam said awkwardly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly patted his arm. \"I know,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s unbelievable.\" \"I\u0027m trying to find out what happened,\" Kelly said. \"That\u0027s why I\u0027m here. I hope you can help me.\" She took a seat on the couch, filled with a sense of anticipation and apprehension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam\u0027s face darkened. \"No one seems to know the full story. Mark was working on a secret project.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was apparently collaborating with two or three other employees at KIG. They say he committed suicide.\" \"I don\u0027t believe it,\" Kelly said vehemently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t either.\" His voice softened. \"And do you know the main reason? Because of you.\" Kelly looked at Sam, puzzled. \"I don\u0027t understand? \"How could Mark ever leave someone as lovely as you? How could anyone ever leave someone as lovely as you?\" He was moving closer. \"What happened is a great tragedy, Kelly, but life has to go on, doesn\u0027t it?\" He put her hand in his. \"We all need someone, don\u0027t we? He\u0027s gone, but I\u0027m here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour kind of woman needs a man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My kind of-?\" \"Mark told me how passionate you are. He says you love it.\" Kelly turned to him in surprise. Mark would never have said that. He would never have discussed her like that with anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam put one arm around her shoulders. \"Yes. Mark told me you really had to have it. He used to tell me how great you were in bed.\" Kelly was suddenly panic-stricken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam said, \"And Kelly, if it makes you feel any better, Mark didn\u0027t suffer at all.\" And she looked into Sam Meadows\u0027s eyes and she knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll be having dinner in a few minutes,\" Sam said. \"Why don\u0027t we work up an appetite in bed?\" Kelly felt suddenly faint. She managed to force a smile. \"That sounds great.\" Her mind was working furiously. He was too big for her to fight, and she had nothing to fight him with. He began fondling her. \"You know you\u0027ve got a great ass, baby. I go for that,\" Kelly smiled. \"Do you?\" She sniffed. \"I\u0027m hungry. Something smells good.\" \"Our dinner.\" Before he could stop her, Kelly got up and moved toward the kitchen. As she passed the dinner table, she got a shock. The table had been set for one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly turned. In the drawing room, Sam was walking over to the door and turning the key in the lock. She watched him put the key in the drawer of an armoire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly looked around the kitchen for a weapon. She had no way of knowing which drawer held the knives. On the counter was a box of angel hair pasta. On the stove was a pot of boiling water, and next to it, a smaller pot with a red sauce that was cooking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam walked into the kitchen and put his arms around Kelly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pretended not to pay any attention. She looked at the sauce on the stove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks wonderful.\" He was stroking her body. \"It is. What do you like to do in bed, baby?\" Kelly\u0027s mind was racing. She said softly, \"Everything. I used to do something kinky to Mark that drove him crazy.\" Sam\u0027s face lit up. \"What was that?\" \"I would take a warm, wet washcloth and-\" She picked up a soft cloth on the sink. \"I\u0027ll show you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrop your pants.\" Sam Meadows grinned. \"Yeah.\" He loosened his trousers and dropped them to the floor. He was wearing boxer shorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now your shorts.\" He dropped his shorts, and his organ was engorged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly said admiringly, \"My, my? She picked up the soft cloth with her left hand and moved toward him. With her right hand, she picked up the pot of boiling water and hurled the contents onto his genitals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly could still hear his screams as she took the key out of the armoire, unlocked the door, and fled. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-38.html","bookId":2370,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:00 AM"}
