We were baby vampires ourselves then. Damon was confused and searching, and I was blood-drunk and ready for action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow our roles had reversed. And yet, whether bound by a shared history or loyalty or even by blood - that mysterious, vexing, life-giving -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esubstance - we were together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn\u0027t trust each other. We didn\u0027t like each other. But we were each other, reflecting our shadow, secret selves in the other\u0027s identity. We were running from a small-town mob that was after me, toward an entire city that believed Damon to be the deadliest murderer in history. We were in it together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we deserved each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs much as I tried to hide it, I had a deadly dark side. And I saw, in Damon\u0027s concerned glances toward Cora and the gentle way he\u0027d cradled Oliver\u0027s body as he brought him to me for burial, that Damon had a deeply feeling, human side. But could the two ever exist in tandem? And how many more humans would be killed before we could live in peace as vampires?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know the answer. But I knew there would be many more deaths. All I could hope was that they wouldn\u0027t be by my own hand. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stefan-s-diaries-the-ripper-the-vampire-diaries-4/page-21.html","bookId":2112,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:15 PM"}
