THE DANCE-SONG.","content":"One evening went Zarathustra and his disciples through the forest; and when he sought for a well, lo, he lighted upon a green meadow peacefully surrounded with trees and bushes, where maidens were dancing together. As soon as the maidens recognised Zarathustra, they ceased dancing; Zarathustra, however, approached them with friendly mien and spake these words:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Cease not your dancing, ye lovely maidens! No game-spoiler hath come to you with evil eye, no enemy of maidens.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e God’s advocate am I with the devil: he, however, is the spirit of gravity. How could I, ye light-footed ones, be hostile to divine dances? Or to maidens’ feet with fine ankles?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To be sure, I am a forest, and a night of dark trees: but he who is not afraid of my darkness, will find banks full of roses under my cypresses.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And even the little God may he find, who is dearest to maidens: beside the well lieth he quietly, with closed eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Verily, in broad daylight did he fall asleep, the sluggard! Had he perhaps chased butterflies too much?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Upbraid me not, ye beautiful dancers, when I chasten the little God somewhat! He will cry, certainly, and weep—but he is laughable even when weeping!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And with tears in his eyes shall he ask you for a dance; and I myself will sing a song to his dance:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A dance-song and satire on the spirit of gravity my supremest, powerfulest devil, who is said to be “lord of the world.”—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And this is the song that Zarathustra sang when Cupid and the maidens danced together:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Of late did I gaze into thine eye, O Life! And into the unfathomable did I there seem to sink.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But thou pulledst me out with a golden angle; derisively didst thou laugh when I called thee unfathomable.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Such is the language of all fish,” saidst thou; “what THEY do not fathom is unfathomable.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But changeable am I only, and wild, and altogether a woman, and no virtuous one:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Though I be called by you men the ‘profound one,’ or the ‘faithful one,’ ‘the eternal one,’ ‘the mysterious one.’\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But ye men endow us always with your own virtues—alas, ye virtuous ones!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thus did she laugh, the unbelievable one; but never do I believe her and her laughter, when she speaketh evil of herself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And when I talked face to face with my wild Wisdom, she said to me angrily: “Thou willest, thou cravest, thou lovest; on that account alone dost thou PRAISE Life!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then had I almost answered indignantly and told the truth to the angry one; and one cannot answer more indignantly than when one “telleth the truth” to one’s Wisdom.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For thus do things stand with us three. In my heart do I love only Life—and verily, most when I hate her!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But that I am fond of Wisdom, and often too fond, is because she remindeth me very strongly of Life!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She hath her eye, her laugh, and even her golden angle-rod: am I responsible for it that both are so alike?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And when once Life asked me: “Who is she then, this Wisdom?”—then said I eagerly: “Ah, yes! Wisdom!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One thirsteth for her and is not satisfied, one looketh through veils, one graspeth through nets.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Is she beautiful? What do I know! But the oldest carps are still lured by her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Changeable is she, and wayward; often have I seen her bite her lip, and pass the comb against the grain of her hair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Perhaps she is wicked and false, and altogether a woman; but when she speaketh ill of herself, just then doth she seduce most.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When I had said this unto Life, then laughed she maliciously, and shut her eyes. “Of whom dost thou speak?” said she. “Perhaps of me?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And if thou wert right—is it proper to say THAT in such wise to my face! But now, pray, speak also of thy Wisdom!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ah, and now hast thou again opened thine eyes, O beloved Life! And into the unfathomable have I again seemed to sink.—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thus sang Zarathustra. But when the dance was over and the maidens had departed, he became sad.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “The sun hath been long set,” said he at last, “the meadow is damp, and from the forest cometh coolness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e An unknown presence is about me, and gazeth thoughtfully. What! Thou livest still, Zarathustra?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Why? Wherefore? Whereby? Whither? Where? How? Is it not folly still to live?—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ah, my friends; the evening is it which thus interrogateth in me. Forgive me my sadness!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Evening hath come on: forgive me that evening hath come on!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thus sang Zarathustra.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2158/61047.html","bookId":445,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 2:08:22 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 2:08:22 PM"}
