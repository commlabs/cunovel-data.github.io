A strange gleam flickered in his eyes as he pointed up toward the Heavens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Paragon... Bridge!” he said softly. Rumbling sounds could be heard coming from inside Meng Hao himself, and suddenly, everyone could see something inside his body. Not even his clothing could cover up the bright arc of light that stretched from the top of his head all the way to his dantian region and formed... a bridge!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA spectacular bridge hidden inside his body, almost like a qi meridian. Then... the bridge materialized up in the sky....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Paragon Bridge!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRUUUUUUMMMMBLLLLE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMassive rumbling could be heard as the sky collapsed, the space it had occupied now completely filled by the Paragon Bridge. It radiated awe-inspiring might, and a dazzling glow. The countless magical symbols which covered its surface glittered, and the bridge was so large that anyone who saw it couldn’t help but stare with wide eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What magic is this...?” The fleeing disciples of the Blacksoul Society gasped and stared, eyes wide with disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatriarch Blacksoul was also gaping. Based on the level of his cultivation base, he knew what he was looking at and cried out in alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Paragon magic! Y-you\u0027re... in the Echelon!!” At the same time that his voice echoed out, pressure exploded out from the Paragon Bridge, crushing down onto the lands, causing the entire world to tremble. Instantly, Patriarch Blacksoul was engulfed by massive force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe trembled, and a look of astonishment appeared on his face. Not only was he terrified by the pressure that was crushing down onto him... his body was physically shaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA terrifying sensation rose up in his heart, and he sensed an indescribable feeling of deadly crisis. That sensation told him that if he tried to fight against this Paragon Bridge, there was a great risk that he would perish!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Impossible! Even the Paragon magic of the Echelon isn’t this powerful. This is impossible!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time that Patriarch Blacksoul was completely shaken, a glowing beam shot out from the Paragon Bridge, a dazzling light filled with Paragon power. In the blink of an eye, it enveloped the incense burner which floated above Patriarch Blacksoul’s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe incense burner began to vibrate, and was then slowly dragged toward the Paragon Bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get back here!” Patriarch Blacksoul growled. He might be experiencing a sensation of deadly crisis, and might have been shaken by the Paragon Bridge, but he was still a 3-Essences Dao Lord. He was the overlord of this world, a person who had fought countless battles throughout his life. Despite being surprised, but he still let out a vicious roar, causing his divine sense to spring out and prevent the incense burner from being taken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had realized earlier that his opponent had come for the incense burner, and he had no intention of letting him take it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the instant that Patriarch Blacksoul roared, Meng Hao extended his hand and made a grasping motion toward the incense burner. The Star Plucking Magic was unleashed, which combined with the power of the Paragon Bridge, causing the incense burner to be dragged rapidly toward Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s my treasure, the legacy of the Blacksoul Society! You think you can just take it away!?” Patriarch Blacksoul bit the tip of his tongue and spit out some blood. Then he roared, causing the incense burner to stop in place. Despite the power of the Paragon magic, it suddenly began to fly back in the direction of Patriarch Blacksoul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao frowned, and his eyes flickered icily. With a cold harrumph, he stepped forward and appeared on top of the Paragon Bridge, where he stamped down violently with his right foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Paragon Bridge rumbled, and the light surrounding it spread out in all directions. The pressure from the bridge then increased to the absolute maximum Meng Hao was capable of unleashing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat amount of crushing force could shake Heaven and Earth!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe planet had already been in a state of imminent collapse, but now, it couldn’t endure any longer. Massive rumbling could be heard... as the surface of the planet crumbled completely!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMassive chunks of land were hurled about wildly, and intense crashing sounds could be heard as cracks spread out everywhere. Mountains were leveled, and rivers evaporated. The countless fleeing Blacksoul Society disciples on the planet were experiencing an apocalypse, and none of them possessed the wherewithal to successfully escape it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the blink of an eye, the cultivators began to scream as the power of planetary destruction completely pulverized them. Even more were consumed by the fissures forming in the crumbling lands around them, and some actually exploded into clouds of blood and gore from the pressure emanating from the bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe few cultivators who somehow managed to evade death would suddenly find themselves facing the terracotta soldier, which swung its greatsword and slaughtered any escapees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire planet that housed the Blacksoul Society was experiencing a doomsday!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe destruction of the lands accelerated, and the sky collapsed. The entire planet... looked like a clenched fist that was now quickly opening up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Crumble!” Meng Hao cried, pushing his hand downward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat gesture caused the pressure coming from the Paragon Bridge to increase by a full order of magnitude, ensuring that the entire planet was completely destroyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRUUUUUUMMMMBLLLLE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole planet was collapsing!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCountless fragments shot out into the starry sky as a massive force exploded out from the planet itself. It exploded, sending a huge shockwave blasting out in all directions. Without exception, all of the Blacksoul Society disciples were hit, causing blood to spray out in all directions as their bodies were shredded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire planet was now reduced to countless fragments which floated out into the starry sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only things that remained were wreckage, corpses, and chunks of gore....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reek of blood hung heavy over the area, and it seemed as if it would never dissipate for all eternity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatriarch Blacksoul stared in shock and coughed up a mouthful of blood. His body withered a bit, and began to tremble. His mouth opened, and a strange sound could be heard, as if he had thousands of things he wanted to say, but they were all stuck in his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the moment that the planet collapsed and the blood sprayed from his mouth, the incense burner which he had been attempting to wrest control of, was wrenched away by Meng Hao and the Paragon Bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a bright beam of colorful light, the incense burner... flew toward Meng Hao, shrank down, and landed in his palm!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that instant, Meng Hao shivered as he was sensed some familiar fluctuations coming from inside the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, whether it was because they were inside the incense burner, or because of other reasons, those fluctuations were very faint. So faint, in fact, that they seemed to be on the verge of fading away completely. For some reason, Meng Hao... felt uneasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, there was no time to investigate the matter now. Planetary debris was floating about in all directions, and in the middle of it all was a bridge, upon which stood Meng Hao. Beneath that bridge was Patriarch Blacksoul, trembling violently, eyes completely bloodshot, seemingly on the verge of going mad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked around at the destroyed planet that had once housed the Blacksoul Society, and all of the dead disciples. The sect which he had personally built up was now fading away into the starry sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sight caused him to tremble, and throw his head back and let out the most piercing of howls!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Child, I won’t rest until you are dead!!” As the sound of his howl echoed out in all directions, his energy surged up. His hair was thrown into disarray as he went completely mad. Staring dead at Meng Hao, he charged in attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEssence power erupted around him, causing Meng Hao’s eyes to widen. Of course, he was well aware that his action of destroying this planet would catch the attention of the Heavengod Alliance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, he probably didn’t have very much time left before the Alliance’s almighty experts showed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao sighed. He had chosen to destroy the planet because he had no other alternative. That was the only way to inflict serious damage to Patriarch Blacksoul, and thus lay hands on the incense burner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve got to end this quickly!” Meng Hao’s eyes flickered with killing intent. He quickly placed a sealing mark on the incense burner and put it away, then lifted his right hand high into the air, causing the Battle Weapon to appear once more as a shocking blade!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRUMBLE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao\u0027s energy surged up and then exploded out, causing a Heaven-shaking, Earth-shattering murderous aura to transform him into something like a celestial warrior!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, the meat jelly flew out of his bag of holding, transforming into a suit of armor. His energy once again exploded up, creating a tempest that swept all the dust and rubble around him away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA red beam of light flew out, which was the mastiff. As it became a cape, Meng Hao threw his head back and roared, and an intense, bloody glow erupted up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he lifted up his left hand, within which was his fourth Nirvana Fruit, which he pushed down onto his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it merged into him, rumbling filled his mind, and the world around him changed. The rubble of the planet, the starry sky... all turned azure!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Meng Hao stood on the Paragon Bridge, he suddenly breathed in sharply, which caused the Paragon Bridge to immediately flare with boundless light. A sensation of unbridled supremacy emanated from it, which was sucked in and absorbed by Meng Hao, so that it seemed as if he were....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA living, breathing Paragon!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Patriarch Blacksoul closed in, Meng Hao performed a tremendous downward slash toward him with the Battle Weapon!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was his most powerful state, and his most powerful strike. He was at the pinnacle!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe starry sky seemed to lurch to a stop. Natural laws scattered. Time seemed to come to a standstill in the Eighth Mountain and Sea....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing that remained within the starry sky was the long blade, radiating brilliant light as it flashed toward Patriarch Blacksoul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatriarch Blacksoul threw his head back and roared, waving both hands. Suddenly, he exploded, causing flesh and blood to burst about. It transformed into a blood mist, from within which surged... a seemingly endless amount of souls!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Blacksoul Heaven Slaughter!” A droning sound could be heard as seemingly endless numbers of souls filled the starry sky, spreading out to fill nearly half of the starry sky above the Heavengod Alliance. The shocking sight caused all of the planets within the affected area to tremble. Countless Heavengod Alliance cultivators who were in meditative trances opened their eyes and looked up in shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that moment, countless streams of divine sense swept through the void toward the area where Meng Hao and Patriarch Blacksoul were fighting!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Heavengod Alliance was thrown into a huge commotion!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1218\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1220\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1219","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM"}
