As soon as she got home, she saw that she had a telephone message.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSetting down her purse, she began to slip off her shoes and pushed the Play button on her machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNate Olsen\u0027s voice stopped her cold, one shoe off, one foot raised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rachel, hi... I\u0027m sorry I missed you.\" His words were followed by a short pause. \"I\u0027m still thinking about our dinner and was just wondering if you were, too. I\u0027ll talk to you later, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty-Five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the first Monday of August, Grace Sherman opened the library and posted the sign for the free movie that would be shown Saturday night. This was a new feature the library had begun in June. It\u0027d been Grace\u0027s idea, and the popularity of the event had surprised and delighted her. She believed the library should be part of the community, that it should be responsive to people\u0027s needs and interests and attract patrons of all ages. She always chose a movie families could watch together. That often meant a classic; this week\u0027s was The African Queen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMondays were always busy and the morning passed quickly. Loretta Bailey returned to her desk and Grace realized her assistant was already back from lunch. It seemed she\u0027d left only a few minutes ago. If Grace was going to have lunch, she had to take her turn now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached into the bottom drawer for her purse and when she straightened she came face-to-face with LisaShore, Cliff Harding\u0027s daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lisa,\" she said, recovering quickly. \"What a pleasant surprise!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Grace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was a lovely young woman who reminded Grace of Cliff in a dozen different ways, although she didn\u0027t resemble him physically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t tell you how happy I am to find you. I took a chance coming into town like this, since I wasn\u0027t sure you\u0027d be here. I felt we should talk.\" The look in her eyes implored Grace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing in Washington?\" That was a silly question; she was visiting her father, of course. Grace had no idea how much Lisa knew about what had happened between her and Cliff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rich and I are here to see Dad. I don\u0027t suppose you could squeeze in a quick lunch, could you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace struggled with her composure but managed to respond graciously. \"Of course I can. Why don\u0027t we sit down for a few minutes first? How\u0027s April?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Growing by leaps and bounds,\" Lisa said, obviously proud of her daughter. \"Dad and Rich took her into Seattle.\" She glanced away guiltily. \"I told them I had a bad case of cramps, which is actually true, so they suggested I stay home. I wanted to come into town to see you—but that part I didn\u0027t share with my dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace understood how difficult it must\u0027ve been for Lisa to mislead her father. What she had to say must be important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace slung her purse over her shoulder, waved goodbye to Loretta and walked out of the library with Cliff\u0027s daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were barely out the door when Lisa spoke with a quiet intensity. \"I just had to find out what went wrong between you and my dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace sighed, unsure whether or not she should be grateful that Cliff hadn\u0027t said anything to his daughter. Then again, maybe he had. It was clear that Lisa knew something, or that she sensed it, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey bought crab salad sandwiches—the Pot Belly\u0027s special of the day—and sat down on a park bench near the marina. Tourists and locals alike strolled past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad won\u0027t tell me a thing,\" Lisa said as soon as they\u0027d unwrapped their sandwiches. \"All I know is that you\u0027re not seeing each other anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace focused her attention on the boats gently bobbing in the marina. She simply couldn\u0027t look Lisa in the eye and explain what she\u0027d done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything\u0027s my fault,\" Grace said, her voice trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer confession was followed by a short silence. \"That\u0027s not what my dad said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s wrong,\" Grace insisted. \"I misled him—no, it\u0027s more than that, I deceived him.\" She refused to minimize her role in their separation. If not for her Internet relationship with Will, she suspected she\u0027d be engaged or even married to Cliff by this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace realized there was no help for it. Lisa had a right to know the truth. \"I was seeing Cliff and at the same time involved with another man.\" There it was—the plain and horrible truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa gasped. \"But that\u0027s what my mother did. Now I understand...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, I know,\" Grace whispered. Her betrayal had been unforgivable in Cliff\u0027s eyes, a repeat of the betrayals he\u0027d endured during his twenty-year marriage. Grace understood that she\u0027d committed the one unpardonable sin and she accepted responsibility for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you still involved with this other man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace shook her head. \"It was quite a while ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why aren\u0027t you seeing Dad?\" Lisa finished the first half of her sandwich. Grace hadn\u0027t started hers; she put it in her bag to eat later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clasped her hands together. \"Cliff won\u0027t have anything to do with me. I can deal with that now but it\u0027s taken me a long time to reach this point. You have a wonderful father, Lisa. Although we aren\u0027t part of each other\u0027s lives any more, I\u0027ll always love him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa wrapped up the remaining half of her lunch, then crossed her arms and leaned back on the park bench. \"I find that interesting, because Dad said almost those identical words to me. That he isn\u0027t part of your life anymore but he loves you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He loves me? He said that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was crazy about you when he brought you out to meet me last year—and he still is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to understand my father. He\u0027s a complex man. He doesn\u0027t give his heart easily, nor does he stop loving someone just like that.\" She snapped her fingers for emphasis. \"Look at all the chances he gave my mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace rejoiced at Lisa\u0027s words, but that joy was virtually shattered by Cliff\u0027s adamant response. He loved her, despite what she\u0027d done, and yet he refused to forgive her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve tried to reach him,\" Grace said in a low voice. \"I was such a fool and when I discovered the other man intended to stay in his marriage...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was married?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace felt her face heat with humiliation. How easy it had been to rationalize her behavior at the time. Now, it mortified her even more. She had no excuse, no justification to offer, other than her own schoolgirl fantasies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa took her hand and squeezed it gently. \"That explains why Dad\u0027s acting this way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace hung her head. \"You don\u0027t know how much I regret everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you do,\" Lisa said gently. \"Still, you bid on my dad in the Dog and Bachelor Auction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you hear about that?\" she asked, surprised that Lisa knew about the charity event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From Cal. How much did Dad cost you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your father was my birthday gift from my friends and my daughters, and they paid a whopping eight hundred dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa let out a low whistle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one paid more for any bachelor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa grinned and gave her a thumbs-up. \"Have you gone on your date already?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace nodded and decided she didn\u0027t want to discuss their evening out. There really wasn\u0027t much to say, which was depressing in itself. \"He sent me flowers afterward,\" she added sadly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That sounds like my dad. You\u0027re probably the only woman other than my mom and me he ever sent flowers to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Lisa was hoping to encourage her, she\u0027d failed miserably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long are you in town?\" Grace asked, changing the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only until tomorrow—that\u0027s why I had to speak to you this afternoon. It was now or never.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m so glad you did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa sighed. \"Dad has your picture in his bedroom. Did you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s on his bedside table. He doesn\u0027t know I saw it, but I did. It\u0027s one of you and Midnight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He probably just forgot to take it down.\" Grace didn\u0027t want to get her hopes up, not after the disappointment of their dinner together, and the fact that she hadn\u0027t heard from him after receiving the flowers. \"Or,\" she said dejectedly, \"he\u0027s just very fond of that horse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he is, but that\u0027s not why he kept the photo in his room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace remembered the day Cliff had taken the picture. It\u0027d been October and her first trip to his ranch. This was before he\u0027d torn down the old barn and replaced it with the bigger, more modern stable. Cliff had given her the \"grand tour,\" and as they walked around his property, he\u0027d shared his vision of the ranch. He spoke of the improvements he hoped to make, the breeding programs he\u0027d planned to institute. She hadn\u0027t understood a lot of it, but she\u0027d felt his passion and his love for horses. That same day, he\u0027d shown her his stallion and then stepped back to take her picture as she stood by the corral fence. At that very moment, Midnight had trotted toward her and poked his head over the top rung, curious about this stranger. Grace had turned to admire him and to stroke his sleek black neck. It was that image Cliff had captured on film. He\u0027d shown her the snapshot, but he must have enlarged and framed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m worried about my dad,\" Lisa confided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? How do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s working too hard and he doesn\u0027t seem nearly as happy as he was the last time I saw him. I didn\u0027t notice it until this summer. He\u0027s been trying to hide it, but I know my father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrace wasn\u0027t nearly as happy, either. \"I wish I could help, but there\u0027s nothing I can do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But there is, don\u0027t you see?\" Lisa said with such fervor that tears sprang to her eyes. \"Win him back, Grace. He loves you and you say you love him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do!\" Her love for him was real; she wanted Lisa to believe that. \"But he doesn\u0027t want to see me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not true. Even Cal said my father\u0027s a different person since you two broke up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What should I do?\" Grace couldn\u0027t think of a single thing she\u0027d left unsaid or undone. Despite Cliff\u0027s repeated rejections, she\u0027d tried again and again, until it became obvious nothing would change his mind about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fight for him,\" Lisa pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who do I fight? Cliff himself? How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wear him down,\" Lisa said. \"Send him cards and letters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"E-mails?\" she suggested, eyebrows raised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Lisa cried. \"Do something—anything—and don\u0027t give up until you\u0027ve broken through his defenses.\" She twisted sideways on the bench, sitting so she could face Grace. \"But only if you sincerely love my father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do,\" Grace assured her again. \"I truly do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I felt you must—but I had to find out. I had to know for sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two women hugged. Grace was so moved by the honesty and hopefulness of Lisa\u0027s words, she felt like weeping. \"Oh, Lisa, I can\u0027t thank you enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t let me down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t,\" she promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat very night, Grace wrote Cliff a long e-mail. She began by thanking him for the flowers and then told him how much their dinner date had meant to her. She said, in simple, straightforward sentences, that she missed him and thought of him often. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/44-cranberry-point-cedar-cove-4/page-34.html","bookId":1944,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:49 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:49 AM"}
