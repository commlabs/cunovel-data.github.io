{"id":13219,"no":21,"title":"XXI CONSTANCE CROSS-EXAMINES","content":"It was like turning to the light the several facets of one of those old-fashioned jewels Flora was privately bearing away, to see the five beauties part company: \"Good-by, good-by,\" kiss, kiss--ah, the sad waste of it!--kiss left, kiss right, \"good-by.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As the Callenders came in again from the veranda, their theme was Flora. \"Yet who,\" asked Constance, \"ever heard her utter a moral sentiment?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, her beauty does that,\" rejoined the kindly Miranda. \"As Captain Kincaid said that evening he--\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, I know. He said he would pass her into heaven on her face, and I think it was a very strange thing for him to say!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why?\" daringly asked Miranda--and ran from the room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The hater of whys turned upon her sister: \"Nan, what\u0027s the matter?... Oh, now, yes, there is. What made you start when Miranda mentioned--Yes, you did. You\u0027re excited, you know you are. When we came in from the garden you and Flora were both--\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now, Connie--\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Pshaw, Nan, I know he\u0027s been here, it\u0027s in your face. Who was with him; Charlie?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes. They just dropped in to say good-by. The battery\u0027s ordered to Virginia. Virginia hasn\u0027t seceded yet, but he feels sure she will before they can get there, and so do I. Don\u0027t you? If Kentucky and Maryland would only--\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now, Nan, just hush. When does he go?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To-morrow. But as to us\"--the girl shrugged prettily while caressing her roses--\"he\u0027s gone now.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How did he talk?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh--quite as usual.\" The head bent low into the flowers. \"In the one pretty way he has with all of us, you know.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Constance would not speak until their eyes met again. Then she asked, \"Did Charlie and Flora give him any chance--to express himself?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, Con, don\u0027t be foolish. He didn\u0027t want any. He as much as said so!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ye-es,\" drawled the bride incredulously, \"but--\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, he really did not, Con. He talked of nothing but the battery flag and how, because I\u0027d presented it, they would forever and ever and ever and ever--\" She waved her hands sarcastically.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Nan, behave. Come here.\" The pair took the sofa. \"How did he look and act when he first came in? Before you froze him stiff?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I didn\u0027t freeze him.\" The quiet, hurt denial was tremulous. \"Wood doesn\u0027t freeze.\" The mouth drooped satirically: \"You know well enough that the man who says his tasks have spared him no time to--to--\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Nan, honest! Did you give him a fair chance--the kind I gave Steve?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, Con! He had all the chance any man ever got, or will get, from me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The sister sighed: \"Nan Callender, you are the poorest fisherman--\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m not! I\u0027m none! And if I were one\"--the disclaimant glistened with mirth--\"I couldn\u0027t be as poor a one as he is; he\u0027s afraid of his own bait.\" She began to laugh but had to force back her tears: \"I didn\u0027t mean that! He\u0027s never had any bait--for me, nor wanted any. Neither he nor I ever--Really, Con, you are the only one who\u0027s made any mistake as to either of us! You seem to think--\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, dearie, I don\u0027t think at all, I just know. I know he\u0027s furiously in love with you--Yes, furiously; but that he\u0027s determined to be fair to Fred Greenleaf--\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh!\"--a yet wickeder smile.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, and that he feels poor. You know that if the General--\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The hearer lifted and dropped both arms: \"Oh!--to be continued!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, I know, too, that he doesn\u0027t believe, anyhow, in soldiers marrying. I\u0027ve never told you, sweet, but--if I hadn\u0027t cried so hard--Steve would have challenged Hilary Kincaid for what he said on that subject the night we were married!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Anna straightened, flashed, and then dropped again as she asked, \"Is that all you know?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, I know what counts for more than all the rest; I know you\u0027re a terror to him.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Remotely in the terror\u0027s sad eyes glimmered a smile that was more than half satisfaction. \"You might as well call him a coward,\" she murmured.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not at all. You know you\u0027ve been a terror to every suitor you\u0027ve ever had--except Fred Greenleaf; he\u0027s the only one you couldn\u0027t keep frightened out of his wits. Now this time I know it\u0027s only because you\u0027re--you\u0027re bothered! You don\u0027t know how you\u0027re going to feel--\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now, Con--\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And you don\u0027t want to mislead him, and you\u0027re just bothered to death! It was the same way with me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It wasn\u0027t!\" silently said Anna\u0027s lips, her face averted. Suddenly she turned and clutched her sister\u0027s hands: \"Oh, Con, while we talk trifles Flora\u0027s home lies in ashes!... Yes, he told me so just now.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Didn\u0027t he tell her too?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why, no, Connie, he--he couldn\u0027t very well. It--it would have been almost indelicate, wouldn\u0027t it? But he\u0027s gone now to tell her.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He needn\u0027t,\" said Constance. \"She knows it now. The moment I came in here I saw, through all her lightness, she\u0027d got some heavy news. She must have overheard him, Nan.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Connie, I--I believe she did!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, that\u0027s all right. What are you blushing for?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Blushing! Every time I get a little warm--\" The speaker rose to go, but the sister kept her hand:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Keep fresh for this evening, honey. He\u0027ll be back.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, he won\u0027t. He doesn\u0027t propose to if he could and he couldn\u0027t if he did. To get the battery off to-morrow--\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It won\u0027t get off to-morrow, nor the next day, nor the next. You know how it always is. When Steve--\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, I don\u0027t know anything,\" said Anna, pulling free and moving off. \"But you, oh, you know it all, you and Steve!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But the elder beauty was right. The battery did not go for more than a fortnight, and Hilary came again that evening. Sitting together alone, he and Anna talked about their inner selves--that good old sign! and when she gave him a chance he told her what Greenleaf had said about her and the ocean. Also he confided to her his envy of small-statured people, and told how it hurt him to go about showing the bigness of his body and hiding the pettiness of his soul. And he came the next evening and the next, and the next, and the next, and the next.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2232/62668.html","bookId":440,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 5:16:10 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 5:16:10 AM"}
