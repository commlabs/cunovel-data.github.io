{"id":20990,"no":16,"title":"Chapter 16","content":"\u003cp\u003eIn Y.T.\u0027s peripheral vision she sees a brief flash, hears a clunking noise. She looks over in that direction to see that the source of the light is a sort of doggie door built into the side of the Hong Kong franchise. The doggie door has in the very recent past been slammed open by something coming from the inside, headed for the lawngrid with the speed and determination of a howitzer shell. As all of this registers on Y.T.\u0027s mind, she begins to hear the shouting of the jeeks. This shouting is not angry and not scared either. No one has had time to get scared yet. It is the shouting of someone who has just had a bucket of ice water dumped over his head.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis shouting is still getting underway, she is still turning her head to look at the jeeks, when the doggie door emits another burst of light. Her eyes flick that-a-way; she thinks that she saw something, a long round shadow cross-sectioned in the light for a blurry instant as the door was being slammed inward. But when her eyes focus on it, she sees nothing except the oscillating door, same as before. These are the only impressions left on her mind, except for one more detail: a train of sparks that danced across the lawngrid from the doggie door to the jeeks and back again during this one-second event, like a skyrocket glancing across the lot.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePeople say that the Rat Thing runs on four legs. Perhaps the claws on its robot legs made those sparks as they were digging into the lawngrid for traction. The jeeks are all in motion. Some of them have just been body-slammed into the lawngrid and are still bouncing and rolling. Others are still in mid-collapse. They are unarmed. They are reaching to grip their gun hands with the opposite hands, still hollering, though now their voices are tinged with a certain amount of fear. One of them has had his trousers torn from the waistband all the way down to the ankle, and a strip of fabric is trailing out across the lot, as though he had his pocket picked by something that was in too much of a hurry to let go of the actual pocket before it left. Maybe this guy had a knife in his pocket.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThere is no blood anywhere. The Rat Thing is precise. Still they hold their hands and holler. Maybe it\u0027s true what they say, that the Rat Thing gives you an electrical shock when it wants you to let go of something.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Look out,\" she hears herself saying, \"they got guns.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHiro turns and grins at her. His teeth are very white and straight; he has a sharp grin, a carnivore\u0027s grin. \"No, they don\u0027t. Guns are illegal in Hong Kong, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"They had guns just a second ago,\" Y.T. says, bulging her eyes and shaking her head.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"The Rat Thing has them now,\" Hiro says.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe jeeks all decide they better leave. They run out and get into their taxis and take off, tires asqueal.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eY.T. backs the taxi on its rims out over the STD and into the street, where she grindingly parallel parks it. She goes back into the Hong Kong franchise, a nebula of aromatic freshness trailing behind her like the tail of a comet. She is thinking, oddly enough, about what it would be like to climb into the back of the car with Hiro Protagonist for a while. Pretty nice, probably. But she\u0027d have to take out the dentata, and this isn\u0027t the place. Besides, anyone decent enough to come help her escape from The Clink probably has some kind of scruples about boffing fifteen-year-old girls.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That was nice of you,\" he says, nodding at the parked taxi. \"Are you going to pay for his tires, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m having some cash flow problems.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe stands there in the middle of the Hong Kong lawngrid. They look each other up and down, carefully.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I called my boyfriend. But he flaked out on me,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Another thrasher?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"The same.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You made the same mistake I made once,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Mixing business with pleasure. Going out with a colleague. It gets very confusing.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I see what you mean.\" She\u0027s not exactly sure what a colleague is.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I was thinking that we should be partners,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s expecting him to laugh at her. But instead he grins and nods his head slightly. \"The same thing occurred to me. But I\u0027d have to think about how it would work.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe is astounded that he would actually be thinking this. Then she gets the sap factor under control and realizes: He\u0027s waffling. Which means he\u0027s probably lying. This is probably going to end with him trying to get her into bed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I gotta go,\" she says. \"Gotta get home.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNow we\u0027ll see how fast he loses interest in the partnership concept. She turns her back on him.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, they are impaled on Hong Kong robot spotlights one more time.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eY.T. feels a sharp bruising pain in her ribs, as though someone punched her. But it wasn\u0027t Hiro. He is an unpredictable freak who carries swords, but she can smell chick-punchers a mile off.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Ow!\" she says, twisting away from the impact. She looks down to see a small heavy object bouncing on the ground at their feet. Out in the street, an ancient taxi squeals its tires, getting the hell out of there. A peek is hanging out the rear window, shaking his fist at them. He must have thrown a rock at her.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eExcept it\u0027s not a rock. The heavy thing at her feet, the thing that just bounced off of Y.T.\u0027s ribcage, is a hand grenade. She stares for a second, recognizing it, a well-known cartoon icon made real.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen her feet get knocked out from under her, too fast really to hurt. And just when she\u0027s getting reoriented to that, there is a painfully loud bang from another part of the parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd then everything finally stops long enough to be seen and understood.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe Rat Thing has stopped. Which they never do. It\u0027s part of their mystery that you never get to see them, they move so fast. No one knows what they look like. No one except for Y.T. and Hiro, now.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s bigger than she imagined. The body is Rottweiler-sized, segmented into overlapping hard plates like those of a rhinoceros. The legs are long, curled way up to deliver power, like a cheetah\u0027s. It must be the tail that makes people refer to it as a Rat Thing, because that\u0027s the only ratlike part -- incredibly long and flexible. But it looks like a rat\u0027s tail with the flesh eaten away by acid, because it just consists of segments, hundreds of them neatly plugged together, like vertebrae.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus H. Christ!\" Hiro says. And she knows, from that, that he\u0027s never seen one either.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRight now, the tail is coiled and piled around on top of the Rat Thing\u0027s body like a rope that has fallen out of a tree. Parts of it are trying to move, other parts of it look dead and inert. The legs are moving one by one, spasmodically, not acting in concert. The whole thing just looks terribly wrong, like footage of an airplane that has had its tail blown off, trying to maneuver for a landing. Even someone who is not an engineer can see that it has gone all perverse and twisted.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe tail writhes and lashes like a snake, uncoils itself, rises up off the Rat Thing\u0027s body, gets out of the way of its legs. But still the legs have problems; it can\u0027t get itself up.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Y.T.,\" Hiro is saying, \"don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe does. One footstep at a time, she approaches the Rat Thing.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s dangerous, in case you hadn\u0027t noticed,\" Hiro says, following her a few paces behind. \"They say it has biological components.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Biological components?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Animal parts. So it might be unpredictable.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe likes animals. She keeps walking.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s seeing it better now. It\u0027s not all armor and muscle. A lot of it actually looks kind of flimsy. It has short stubby winglike things projecting from its body: A big one from each shoulder and a row of smaller ones down the length of its spine, like on a stegosaurus. Her Knight Visions tell her that these things are hot enough to bake pizzas on. As she approaches, they seem to unfold and grow.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey are blooming like flowers in an educational film, spreading and unfolding to reveal a fine complicated internal structure that has been all collapsed together inside. Each stubby wing splits off into little miniature copies of itself, and each of those in turn splits off into more smaller copies and so on forever. The smallest ones are just tiny bits of foil, so small that, from a distance, the edges look fuzzy.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is continuing to get hotter. The little wings are almost red hot now. Y.T. slides her goggles up onto her forehead and cups her hands around her face to block out the surrounding lights, and sure enough she can see them beginning to make a dull brownish glow, like an electric stove element that has just been turned on. The grass underneath the Rat Thing is beginning to smoke.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Careful. Supposedly they have really nasty isotopes inside,\" Hiro says behind her. He has come up a little closer now, but he\u0027s still hanging way back.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s an isotope?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"A radioactive substance that makes heat. That\u0027s its energy source.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you turn it off?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t. It keeps making heat until it melts.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eY.T. is only a few feet away from the Rat Thing now, and she can feel the heat on her cheeks. The wings have unfolded as far as they can go. At their roots they are a bright yellow-orange, fading out through red and brown to their delicate edges, which are still dark. The acrid smoke of the burning grass obscures some of the details.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe thinks: The edges of the wings look like something I\u0027ve seen before. They look like the thin metal vanes that run up the outside of a window air conditioner, the ones that you can write your name in by mashing them down with your finger.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOr like the radiator on a car. The fan blows air over the radiator to cool off the engine.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s got radiators,\" she says. \"The Rat Thing has got radiators to cool off.\" She\u0027s gathering intel right at this very moment.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut it\u0027s not cooling off. It\u0027s just getting hotter.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eY.T., surfs through traffic jams for a living. That\u0027s her economic niche: beating the traffic. And she knows that a car doesn\u0027t boil over when it is speeding down an open freeway. It boils over when it is stopped in traffic. Because when it sits still, not enough air is being blown over the radiator.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s what\u0027s happening to the Rat Thing right now. It has to keep moving, keep forcing air over its radiators, or else it overheats and melts down.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Cool,\" she says. \"I wonder if it\u0027s going to blow up or what.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe body converges to a sharp nose. In the front it bends down sharply, and there is a black glass canopy, raked sharply like the windshield of a fighter plane. If the Rat Thing has eyes, this is where it looks out.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eUnder that, where the jaw should be are the remains of some kind of mechanical stuff that has been mostly blown off by the explosion of the grenade.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe black glass windshield -- or facemask, or whatever you call it -- has a hole blown through it. Big enough that Y.T. could put her hand through. On the other side of that hole, it\u0027s dark and she can\u0027t see much, especially so close to the bright orange glare coming from the radiators. But she can see that red stuff is coming out from inside. And it ain\u0027t no Dexron II. The Rat Thing is hurt and it\u0027s bleeding.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"This thing is real,\" she says. \"It\u0027s got blood in its veins?\" She\u0027s thinking This is intel. This is intel. I can make money off this with my pardner -- my pod -- Hiro.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThen she thinks: The poor thing is burning itself alive.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t do it. Don\u0027t touch it, Y.T.,\" Hiro says. She steps right up to it, flips her goggles down to protect her face from the heat. The Rat Thing\u0027s legs stop their spasmodic movements, as though waiting for her.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe bends down and grabs its front legs. They react, tightening their pushrod muscles against the pull of her hands. It\u0027s exactly like grabbing a dog by the front legs and asking it to dance. This thing is alive. It reacts to her. She knows.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe looks up at Hiro, just to make sure he\u0027s taking this all in. He is.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Jerk!\" she says. \"I stick my neck out and say I want to be your partner, and you say you want to think about it? What\u0027s your problem, I\u0027m not good enough to work with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eShe leans back and begins dragging the Rat Thing backward across the Lawngrid. It\u0027s incredibly light. No wonder it can run so fast. She could pick it up, if she felt like burning herself alive. As she drags it backward toward the doggie door, it brands a blackened, smoking trail into the lawngrid. She can see steam rising up out of her coverall, old sweat and stuff boiling out of the fabric. She\u0027s small enough to fit through the doggie door -- another thing she can do and Hiro can\u0027t. Usually these things are locked, she\u0027s tried to mess with them. But this one is opened.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eInside, the franchise is bright, white, robot-polished floors. A few feet from the doggie door is what looks like a black washing machine. This is the Rat Thing\u0027s hutch, where it lurks in darkness and privacy, waiting for a job to do. It is wired into the franchise by a thick cable coming out of the wall. Right now, the hutch\u0027s door is hanging open, which is another thing she\u0027s never seen before. And steam is rolling out from inside of it.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNot steam. Cold stuff. Like when you open your freezer door on a humid day. She pushes the Rat Thing into its hutch. Some kind of cold liquid sprays out of all the walls and bursts into steam before it even reaches the Rat Thing\u0027s body, and the steam comes blasting out the front of the hutch so powerfully that it knocks her on her ass.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe long tail is strung out the front of the hutch, across the floor, and out through the doggie door. She picks up part of it, the sharp machine-tooled edges of its vertebrae pinching her gloves.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly it tenses, comes alive, vibrates for a second. She jerks her hands back. The tail shoots back inside the hutch like a rubber band snapping. She can\u0027t even see it move. Then the hutch door slams shut. A janitor robot, a Hoover with a brain, hums out of another doorway to clean the long streaks of blood off the floor.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAbove her, hanging on the foyer wall facing the main entrance, is a framed poster with a garland of well-browned jasmine blossoms hung around it. It consists of a photo of the wildly grinning Mr. Lee, with the usual statement underneath:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWELCOME!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is my pleasure to welcome all quality folks to visiting of Hong Kong.

The ones who saw our isle as a morsel of Red China\u0027s pleasure have struck their faces in keen astonishment to see many great so-called powers of the olden guard reel in dismay before our leaping strides and charged-up hustling, freewheeling idiom of high-tech personal accomplishment and betterment of all peoples.
