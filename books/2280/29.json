He looked me up, looked up the team and figured he knew what he needed. He’s no fool. He knew, as well, that Madison has our talent. She’s a trusted employee, but he told me right away that she spoke with dead people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s hope that doesn’t put her in danger,” Logan said thoughtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It already has,” Sean muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then we’d better solve this thing damned fast.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean nodded, bade Logan and the others good-night and went through the connecting door to his own room. The police reports were where he’d left them. He collected them and stacked them neatly; Logan would need them in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lay down to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo minutes missing. Two minutes in which to hide a mannequin—and steal a robe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was as good as two days if you knew what you were doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, as he fell asleep, he stopped thinking about the killer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he was thinking about Madison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt as if he’d known her forever. As if she’d been part of his life, part of his consciousness. But it had only been two days….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVengeance no longer needed to watch. There was something wrong. The girl knew she was in danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat damned Sean Cameron. It should have gone so smoothly. The police had seen what was there to be seen, and now—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang. Luckily, Vengeance was alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing the number on the caller ID screen of the phone, Vengeance cursed silently. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m scared.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be an idiot!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The investigation is getting serious. It was supposed to look like a locked-room mystery. Once Alistair was charged, that was supposed to be the end!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And it will continue to look that way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, no, the FBI is all over the place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even if they make discoveries, they’ll never know, they’ll never understand, they’ll never be able to trace the truth!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept talking; she was panicking. Talk, talk, talk. Vengeance tried to be nicer, to be more reassuring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just keep your story straight!” Vengeance warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe calmed down, and Vengeance reminded her again not to call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I call you—that’s one thing. Don’t you call me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Vengeance was able to hang up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Vengeance grew thoughtful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVengeance’s partner was….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVengeance’s partner might have to meet with an accident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The M.E. is going to think we’re ghouls,” Madison whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d come to the morgue again with Sean and Katya Sokolov, who’d been an M.E. in San Antonio before joining the Krewe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d stopped at Madison’s bungalow to feed Ichabod—and bring Bogie with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile it seemed natural to Madison that the team’s only pathologist would want to view the body and the autopsy report, there was no ostensible reason for a civilian to be there a second time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mortal remains, just mortal remains,” Bogie told her. He grinned at Katya. “Now, while you may be the one with the experience in a morgue, you might want to stop staring at me. They’ll think you’re not right in the head, you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat flushed. “Sorry! I’m still so…overwhelmed. You can’t imagine what a fan I am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you.” Bogie looked at Madison. “Maybe that’s why I hang around. I need the adulation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shh,” Sean warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I feel like a ghoul,” Madison whispered again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Trust me, you’re fine. You’re with me, and if anyone questions that, I’m asking you questions about the young woman as you knew her in life,” Kat said. “Not to worry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were met then in reception by an attendant who escorted them back to a private autopsy room. Dr. Lee Chang was waiting there for them, standing silently behind the gurney that held the remains of the woman who had once been Jenny Henderson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dr. Chang, thank you,” Sean said. “I’d like you to meet Dr. Katya Sokolov, who is with our team. She’d like to go over your report with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course. Dr. Sokolov, pleased to meet you,” Chang said, shaking Kat’s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe offered her his clipboard. Kat came around the gurney, toward the counter where there was a sink and a huge overhead light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison heard her speaking with Chang as he ushered her closer to the body. Bogie stood on the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried not to breathe through her nose. She tried not to hear the trickle of water and smell the chemical scent that couldn’t be disguised by any manner of freshener or filter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny, Madison said silently. She still found it difficult, but she touched the arm of the corpse. It astonished her that a human being could feel so absolutely stiff and cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny’s eyes opened. They became enormous as she stared not at Madison but at Bogie standing beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHumphrey Bogart! Jenny said in silent awe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the—well, not in the flesh, kid. Bogie shook his head. This is no place for a girl like you, Miss Henderson. There’s got to be someplace you can go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know how, Jenny said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome with us. Just will yourself. Get up, and come with us, Bogie urged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadison wanted to scream in protest. No, living with one ghost is enough!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t. I don’t…I don’t… I’m cold and I’m scared…but I can’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank God, Madison thought for a moment. But that was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squeezed Jenny’s arm lightly. You can. You can. Bogie did it, and if he did it, you can, too. Jenny, don’t you want to help us catch your killer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny nodded solemnly. She glanced from Bogie to Madison to Sean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’re a cop, right? she asked him. You came soon after I got here. She smiled vaguely. You know I always wanted to be in the movies, she said. I guess now…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’re famous, Bogie told her. And you’ll become a legend when this is solved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As you can see,” Dr. Chang said, drawing Kat back to the autopsy table, “she was killed with one sure cut. The intention was to kill. I told Agent Cameron earlier that the strike itself was planned. Unopposed, the killer managed what he intended with ease.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat nodded. “Despite the fragile position of the artery, it’s really not easy to aim so surely and deliver such a deadly strike. There are no hesitation wounds, and poor Jenny doesn’t have a defensive wound on her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The whole thing would have taken a matter of seconds,” Dr. Chang said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Way less than two minutes,” Sean commented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChang frowned, looking at him. “Yes, of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean stepped up behind Kat, grabbed her and mimed a knife and the blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think that was eight seconds,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSean released her. “And the killer didn’t really need the extra time when he was in the tunnel because no camera was running there, and he knew it. I believe he had to be somewhere in the studio or down in the tunnel. Or even in the Black Box Cinema.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, Dr. Chang,” Kat said, shaking the M.E.’s hand again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you coming? Bogie silently asked Jenny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m naked and chopped to pieces, Jenny said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, just rise, and think about yourself in a favorite outfit. The flesh is nothing now, and the soul, the mind, are everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Caleb will take you out,” Chang said, indicating the assistant who had led them in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he did, Madison walked between Kat and Sean. She knew that Bogie was behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt a little prickle at her nape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she knew that Jenny had risen to join them, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny was going to help. She was going to come with them, and relive her own murder at the scene of the crime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan Raintree was still setting up the command center for the team in the designated room at the police station—and having his own briefing with Knox. When Sean called him, he discovered that the briefing was nearly finished, and that he and the others would still join them at one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was just noon, but Sean wanted to get to the studio as quickly as possible. He was convinced that if they could figure out how someone besides Alistair might have gotten in—how the robe had been stolen—they could get on with the rest of the puzzle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if they failed, at the very least they’d create reasonable doubt that Alistair was the killer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they couldn’t fail. Because even with reasonable doubt, the press had branded him a killer, and he’d never live a normal life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs much as Sean needed Madison, he was afraid that after the previous night, it was no longer wise to involve her. Except that she was already involved and therefore targeted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other problem was that he was afraid to leave her anywhere on her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut nothing had really happened, he told himself. Bogie might well have been mistaken. He was very protective of his earthly charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in his heart, he didn’t believe that Bogie was wrong about the danger to Madison. The killer was devious, with a definite agenda, and wasn’t going to let anyone stand in his or her way. Madison wasn’t in law enforcement; she’d probably never even handled a gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they drove away from the morgue, he decided he had to try to protect her. “Madison, I know this won’t be easy for you, but I’m going to take you to the police station. We’ll have you hang around in the team’s ops center while we’re at the studio and try to get the word out that you have nothing to do with the investigation anymore.” He glanced at her in the rearview mirror. She was seated in back, between the ghostly Bogie and Jenny Henderson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be ridiculous,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m concerned about your safety.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-unholy-krewe-of-hunters-6/page-29.html","bookId":2280,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:43:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:43:02 PM"}
