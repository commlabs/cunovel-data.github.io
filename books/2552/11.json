He didn\u0027t know how, but his body had extr uded them during daysleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he\u0027d fed - God, how he hated the word, the concept, the act. It made him feel like some sort of jungle animal; he would never get used to it. The w omen had decided to alternate, so Lacey had been the donor this time. The s un was just about down, and the three of them had taken their usual positio ns around the coffee table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Joe had noticed that Carole seemed withdrawn. She looked tired, but he sensed it was more than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m okay\" Carole said without looking at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLacey said, \"She\u0027s been like this all day.\" This earned her a brief glare fr om Carol. \"Well it\u0027s true. You barely said two words to me before we went to sleep, and maybe half a dozen since we woke up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you sleep well?\" Joe said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As a matter of fact, no,\" Carole said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bad dreams?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a way.\" She looked up, first at Joe, then at Lacey. \"Are we proud of ours elves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About what?\" Joe said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Lacey said. \"We reduced the world\u0027s undead population by eight and we learned something that could turn this fight around: kill one of the big-shot undead and a whole lot of others die too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarole said, \"What about how we learned that secret?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLacey shook her head. \"I\u0027m not following.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarole sighed and looked at the ceiling. \"Torture. Am I the only one who\u0027s b othered by the fact that we tortured that creature into giving us the inform ation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Lacey said with an edge on her voice. Joe could sense his niece\u0027s ba ck rising. \"I guess you could say you are. They\u0027re already dead, Carole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, they\u0027re undead. And they very obviously feel pain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hang on now,\" Joe said. He caught Carole\u0027s troubled gaze and held it. \"We d id what we had to, Carole. I didn\u0027t like it, and I\u0027m sure Lacey didn\u0027t eithe r, but this is war and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A war for what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For survival,\" Lacey said. \"Them or us. This isn\u0027t a war of ideologies, Carol e,\" Lacey said. \"And it\u0027s not a war of religions either. This is a war for the survival of the human race.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if we have to sacrifice our humanity to win it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe leaned back and kept silent. This wasn\u0027t what he\u0027d wanted to talk to Caro le about, but he sensed this argument had been brewing all day, maybe longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBest to stay out of the line of fire unless it escalated too far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ever hear of the Spanish Inquisition, Carole?\" Lacey said. \"That was \u0027human ity\u0027 at its most creative. We invented torture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound proud of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all. I look at a picture of a rack or an Iron Maiden and my stomach t urns. My point is that we, as the living, don\u0027t exactly have clean hands when it comes to depravity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not worried about humanity\u0027s hands,\" Carole said sofdy. \"I\u0027m worried a bout ours - the three of us. I\u0027d like to believe that we deserve to win. But if in the process we become like the enemy, what have we won?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The right to survive!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that all you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Lacey shot to her feet and pounded the table. \"I want more! I want t o see every single one of those bloodsucking parasites dead and rotting in the sun! They robbed me of the person I loved more than anyone in my life, they took my parents - maybe I was on rotten terms with them, and maybe I\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ell always be pissed at them for naming me Lacey, but they were still my pa rents - and then they took one of the few men in the world that I love and r espect and tried to turn him into a monster like them. I want them gone, Carole, I want them wiped off the face of the earth, and I want them to go screaming in agony, and I\u0027m for doing whatever it takes to achieve that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice broke and tears streamed down her cheeks as she pounded the tab le with each word. \"Whatever - it - takes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe rose, put an arm around Lacey\u0027s shoulders, and let her lean against him. Time to make peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m okay,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you\u0027re not. None of us has been okay since the invasion. We\u0027re all da maged to varying degrees, but we all want the same thing. Carole has a val id point. We need to win - we must win - but maybe there should be a line we w on\u0027t cross in order to win. I think we may have crossed that line at the Post Office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt Lacey stiffen and shake her head. \"No lines, no limits, no quarter, n o mercy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe tightened his grip on his niece\u0027s shoulders. How was he going to salvage this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we leave it that we agree to disagree and hope we don\u0027t have to cross the line again - hope that we don\u0027t find ourselves in a position where we eve n have to think about crossing it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if that moment came, Joe wondered, what side of that line would he c ome down on?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLacey shrugged, reluctantly, he thought. \"I guess I\u0027m all right with that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarole nodded. \"So am I. I pray we\u0027re never faced with that choice again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" Joe said, sagging with relief. \"You two had me worried there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Lacey said, looking up at him with a half-smile playing about her lips. \"You thought we\u0027d break up the team? Never happen. Right, Carole?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never. Our work is too important. But I thought it needed an airing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s aired,\" Joe said. \"Now let me air something else.\" He sat and t ook Carole\u0027s hands in his. \"How long have you been wiring yourself with exp losives?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked away. \"A while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think that should be obvious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was. But for Joe it was unthinkable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carole, you mustn\u0027t. . . you can\u0027t...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t,\" she said. \"Not unless all hope is gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even then - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe faced him. \"I will not become one of them, Joseph. And didn\u0027t you tell us yourself that you jumped off the Empire State Building?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, he had, hadn\u0027t he. He wished he hadn\u0027t told them. It cut off his argumen t at the knees. What could he say - that it was all right for him but not for h er?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But blowing yourself up ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of Carole being torn to pieces, bits of her splattered against th e walls and ceiling of a room, or scattered up and down a street, sickened hi m.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile was tremulous. \"What better way to go? I put my hand in my pocket, I press a button, and it\u0027s over - instantaneous, painless, and, considering t he straits I\u0027ll be in at that moment, I\u0027ll probably take a few of the enemy with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I kind of like that idea,\" Lacey said. \"Maybe you can wire me and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe held up a hand. \"Lacey, please.\" He stared at Carole. \"All right. What c an I say? It\u0027s something only you can decide, Carole. But I beg you, when th ings look blackest, when you think there\u0027s no way out and the situation can\u0027t get worse, hold off pressing that button. Give it just one more minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I don\u0027t want to lose you. And who knows? Maybe in that one extra m inute the situation will start to turn around. Promise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"Promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe leaned back. He\u0027d thought he\u0027d feel better confronting her about this, but he didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put it behind him for now and looked first at Lacey, then Carole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. That\u0027s settled - I hope. Now we should plan our next step. Whe n do we leave for New York?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLacey dropped back into her seat. \"New York? So soon? Are we ready for th at?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think we have much choice,\" Joe said. He got up and settled himself on the couch. \"First off, I don\u0027t think there\u0027s another nest we can practice on. Second, after what we did this morning, I\u0027ve got a feeling this area\u0027s go ing to be on the receiving end of a lot of attention. So while they\u0027re lookin g this way, gearing up to make a move against the church and the people holdi ng it, I propose we sneak in under their radar and strike where they least ex pect it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarole was nodding. \"I like it. And from the way things went this morning, I believe dawn is the best time. But I assume we\u0027ll find more than three col laborators guarding the Empire State Building.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lots more,\" Joe said. He glanced at his niece. \"Too many for even Annie Oa kley here to take out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLacey smiled. \"Oh, I don\u0027t know about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got up and went to the dining area. She returned dragging a large canva s mail sack. She set it beside the couch and pulled open the top. Joe start ed when he saw the jumble of weapons inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good Lord, Lacey, what did you do? Rob an armory?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Almost as good. Before we left the Post Office this morning I collected e very pistol and piece of ammo I could find, from Vichy and undead alike. E\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003even picked up that sawed-off shotgun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe shook his head. \"It\u0027s still not enough. We\u0027re only three and there\u0027s doze ns of them. We\u0027ll need another way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLacey looked at Carole. \"Explosives? That napalm you cooked up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarole shook her head. \"Nothing I can make has the detonation velocity nec essary to damage a building like the Empire State.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLacey looked glum. \"Then what? If we can\u0027t get inside - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I have a idea,\" Carole said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLacey brightened. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just the start of one. Let me work it through first. How long have we got?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to leave as soon as possible,\" Joe said. \"Hit them before they find out what we did at the Post Office. Or if they do know, catch them while they\u0027re still off balance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we should make the trip by day,\" Lacey said. \"That way the only one s around to stop us will be living. At night we\u0027ll have to dodge the undead as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I can\u0027t help you during the day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLacey smiled and nudged the letter bag with a toe. \"I think Carole and I c an handle any Vichy we meet along the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe wasn\u0027t keen on lying helpless in a car trunk while the two women took all the risks, but he couldn\u0027t fault Lacey\u0027s logic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right then,\" he said. \"We leave at dawn. Will that give you enough time, Carole?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope so. I\u0027ll need to take the car to see if I can find what I need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Just get back in time so we can stock up for the trip. We need to fin d some gas too. The Lincoln\u0027s pretty low.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No need,\" Lacey said. \"There\u0027s a cool convertible with a full tank sitting in the garage. We can take that instead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like you\u0027ve got all the bases covered. Only one thing left to do befo re we go. Carole, drop Lacey off at the church so she can tell them what we did at the Post Office and to expect reprisals. But most important, tell the m the get-death secret. Have Gerald Vance get on his shortwave and start bro adcasting it around the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think anyone\u0027ll believe it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope so. Maybe in New York we\u0027ll find a way to give the world more tang ible proof.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoe didn\u0027t answer. He was working on the beginning of an idea of his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBARRETT . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a little after midnight when James Barrett stepped out of the elevato r into the Observation Deck atrium. A couple of Franco\u0027s get-guards pulled p istols and started for him. Where was Artemis tonight? He was usually the fi rst to get in the face of anyone, living or undead, who set foot on the deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething in their eyes, their expressions. Was it fear? What was going do wn here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Franco said to meet him here,\" Barrett said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go check,\" said one of the guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs commander of the Empire State Building\u0027s human contingent, Barrett was u sed to being taken straight to Franco. Why this extra layer of insulation a ll of a sudden?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, he was responsible for round-the-clock security. He could have stayed around just on days - the really important time for security - but that meant he\u0027d never get to see Franco, and Franco would never see him. So he caught a few winks here and there when he could and made sure he was arou nd for at least some of the night shift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d held the job for six months now. That meant he had nine-and-a-half years of servitude left. That was the deal with the undead: ten years of service a nd they\u0027d turn him. Fine for the other slobs to wait that long, but not him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d risen as high as a living man could go in Franco\u0027s organization. He need ed to take the next step, needed to be turned, and soon. But he still hadn\u0027t found the lever to boost him to that stage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come with us,\" said the returning vampire. \"But first...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe patted Barrett down and removed the .44 Magnum from his shoulder holst er. He stared at it a moment, then handed it back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarrett hid his shock. He\u0027d never been frisked before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go,\" said the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut instead of escorting him to the outer deck, he led him into a stairwell to the left of the elevator bank and down the steps to the eighty-fifth floo r. After a short walk along a hallway, he was passed through another set of guards into a bare room furnished with only a king-size four-poster bed. Lar ge sheets of plywood had been bolted over the windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFranco paced the room, his hands behind his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s been some trouble,\" he said without preamble, without so much as a glance at Barrett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\" It must be really serious, he thought. \"I haven\u0027t heard anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wouldn\u0027t,\" Franco said, his eyes were on the floor as he paced. \"I se nt Artemis down to New Jersey a few days ago to check up on Olivia and see to it that she was staying on top of things. If she wasn\u0027t - as I was sure was the case - he was to take over. This evening I received a report from do wntown that - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to catch himself and cast a quick sidelong glance at Barrett. Wh at was he hiding? He knew that Artemis and a few of his get lived down in the Village. What had Franco heard?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFranco shook his head and went on. \"I heard a report that made me suspect t hat something might have happened to Artemis. So I sent a flyer down to che ck.\" Finally he looked up at Barrett. \"Artemis is dead. So is Olivia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, shit,\" Barrett said. It was the best he could do. He was all but speechles s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArtemis dead? Barrett couldn\u0027t wrap his mind around it. Was there a tougher undead son of a bitch in the world? He doubted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Staked. Same as Olivia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her guards too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A massacre! Who - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suspect it has something to do with that vigilante priest. That\u0027s the only a nswer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he\u0027s one of you now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His followers aren\u0027t. Maybe when they found out that we turned him, instea d of being demoralized, they went berserk. I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarrett heard opportunity knocking. Here was a chance to stand out, to mayb e shorten that nine-and-a-half-year wait for immortality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA plan was already forming. Show up down there, pretend to be another refugee, infiltrate their ranks, wait till the time was right, till they were off gu ard, then blow them all away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want me to go down and check it out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFranco shook his head. \"No. I need you here. I want you to gather your men f rom inside and outside the city and concentrate them around this building. I\u0027m going to organize a counter strike and I don\u0027t want any interruptions. By next week I\u0027ll have gathered a horde of ferals to set loose down there. No quarter, no survivors. Then I\u0027m going to incinerate the entire area. The fla mes will be visible for miles. Not one house or church or synagogue will be left standing.

His ass was on the line here too, and if a caravan full of vampire hunter s was headed this way, he wanted to know about it before they reached Fifth Avenue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause invariably vampire hunters were cowboy hunters too. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/midnight-mass/page-11.html","bookId":2552,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:30:25 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:30:25 AM"}
