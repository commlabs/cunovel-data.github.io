She clambered to her feet. ‘Take my hand, Rutt. It’s time to walk.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crouched, staring up at the gate. Beneath it the crumbling ruin of Kettle House was like a thing crushed under a heel. Something like blood oozed out from its roots to carve runnels down the slope. She believed it was dead, but of course there was no way to know for sure .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no glory in failure. Kilava had learned that long, long ago. The passing of an age was always one of dissolution, a final sigh of exhaustion and surrender. She had seen her kin vanish from the world – the venal mockery that were the T’lan Imass hardly weighed as much as dust upon the scales of survival – and she well understood the secret desires of Olar Ethil .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe the hag would succeed. The spirits knew, she was ripe for redemption .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKilava had lied. To Onrack, to Udinaas, to Ulshun Pral and his clan. There had been no choice. To remain here would have seen them all slain, and she would not have that on her conscience .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the wound was breached, the Eleint would enter this world. There was no hope of stopping them. T’iam could not be denied, not with what was coming .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only unknown, to her mind, was the Crippled God. The Forkrul Assail were simple enough, as bound to the insanity of final arguments as were the Tiste Liosan. Kin in spirit, those two. And she believed she knew what her brother intended to do, and she would leave him to it , and if her blessing meant anything, well then he had it, with all her heart. No, the Crippled God was the only force that troubled her .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered the earth’s pain when he was brought down from the sky. She remembered his fury and his agony when first he was chained. But the gods were hardly done with him. They returned again and again, crushing him down, destroying his every attempt to find a place for himself. If he cried out for justice, no one was interested in listening. If he howled in wretched suffering, they but turned away .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Crippled God was not alone in that neglect. The mortal realm was crowded with those who were just as wounded, just as broken, just as forgotten. In this way, all that he had become – his very place in the pantheon – had been forged by the gods themselves .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now they feared him. Now, they meant to kill him .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Because the gods will not answer mortal suffering. It is too much … work.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe must know what they intended – she was certain of it. He must be desperate in seeking a way out, an escape. No matter what, she knew he would not die without a fight. Was this not the meaning of suffering?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer feline eyes narrowed on the gate. Starvald Demelain was a fiery red welt in the sky, growing, deepening .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Soon,’ she whispered .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would flee before them. To remain here was too dangerous. The destruction they would bring to this world would beggar the dreams of even the Forkrul Assail. And once upon the mortal realm, so crowded with pathetic humans, there would be slaughter on a colossal scale. Who could oppose them? She smiled at the thought .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ There are a few, aren’t there? But too few. No, friends, let them loose. T’iam must be reborn, to face her most ancient enemy. Chaos against order, as simple – as banal – as that. Do not stand in their path – not one of you could hope to survive it .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat then of her children?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Dear brother, let us see, shall we? The hag’s heart is broken, and she will do whatever she can to see it healed. Despise her, Onos – the spirits know, she deserves nothing else – but do not dismiss her. Do not .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed very complicated .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKilava Onass looked up at the wound .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ But it isn’t. It isn’t anything like that at all .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRock cracked in Kettle House, startling her. Reddish mists roiled out from the sundered walls .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ She was flawed, was Kettle. Too weak, too young.’ What legacy could be found in a child left alone, abandoned to the fates? How many truths hid in the scatter of small bones? Too many to bear thinking about .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother stone shattered, the sound like snapping chains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKilava returned her attention to the gate .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGruntle slumped against a massive boulder, in the full sun, and leaned his head back against the warm stone, closing his eyes. Instinct’s a bitch . The god who had damned him was a burning presence deep inside, filling him with an urgency he could not understand. His nerves were frayed; he was exhausted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had journeyed through countless realms, desperate to find the quickest path to take him … where? A gate. A disaster about to be unleashed. What is it you so fear, Trake? Why can you not just tell me, you miserable rat-chewing bastard? Show me an enemy. Show me someone I can kill for you, since that seems to be the only thing that pleases you . \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-199.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
