Jagger cried out with each thrust, but Nikolai could show him no mercy. His hips began to snap in a forceful rhythm that left Jagger clutching the sheet beneath him and grunting with each thrust. Nikolai reached beneath Jagger and found his cock, already half hard again. He pulled and stroked it without mercy, forcing Jagger’s orgasm, making him come again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you feel me inside you, Princeling? Can you feel my heart beating deep inside your body? You’re mine, baby. Sweet baby…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJagger leaned his head back against Nikolai’s chest, and Nikolai stuck his tongue deep in his ear, making him arch and twist under him, causing Nikolai’s shaft to press even deeper inside him. “Mine,” he growled in Jagger’s ear. “My mate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJagger turned his face toward Nikolai and gasped out one word that filled Jagger with joy. “Yours,” he said. That word made Nikolai lose all control and he came so hard it left him boneless and sated, sagging against his little prince. Jagger was his and he’d never let him go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJagger turned his face into Nikolai’s chest and he mumbled something Nikolai couldn’t understand. “What baby? What did you say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I said—” He looked up at Nikolai. “That I-I love you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikolai felt his heart flutter a little in his chest. Well, damn. “God, baby, I love you too. So much I thought it might kill me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJagger smiled shyly. “You kept it to yourself pretty well. My mother told me you did, but I thought it was just, you know, that you wanted to control me and tell me what to do. Maybe even make me suffer for what I did to you at first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikolai pulled him closer and crushed his lips into Jagger’s. When they were both nearly breathless, Nikolai whispered against Jagger’s mouth. “Are you suffering yet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking up from under his eyelashes, Jagger gazed at Nikolai with speculation. “You kind of deserved punishment, you know. All those lies about your ‘stepbrothers.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry about that, Princeling, but I didn’t think you were ready to hear that you were my mate just yet, and I never expected my family to bust in there and try to rescue me like that.” Nikolai chuckled. “My cousin Blayde’s new mate is a human who’s been in some porn flicks. I remembered one of them in particular, ‘Some Day My Prince Will Come.’ It gave me the idea. That and the fact that my old Nanna used to tell us the story.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm,” Jagger said with a little frown. “Yes, I looked it up later on the compnet—an ancient human fairy tale. Very funny. Maybe when you came in just now I should have had a glass slipper waiting for you. Isn’t that what Cinderella’s prince gave her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Probably not a good look for me,” Nikolai laughed. “My family already thought you tried to put me in a dress. High heels would make Lucas lose his mind completely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the story I read, the prince rescued Cinderella.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s right, sweetheart. Just like when you agreed to that crazy contract Lucas came up with. You saved my life by saying yes. I couldn’t have stood it if you’d refused.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So in a way, I did rescue you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, baby,” Nikolai said tenderly, pulling him closer in his arms. “And I rescued you right back. And I always will—forever after.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE END \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-alpha-s-concubine-love-slaves-of-the-alphas-2/page-19.html","bookId":1592,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:25:17 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:25:17 AM"}
