{"id":99390,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\u003cp\u003eNadia falls silent. She squats with her face averted. Raz and Sharmila look anxious and move away to discuss the revelation in whispers. I stay where I am, watching Beranabus work. I\u0027m not that disturbed by Nadia\u0027s prediction. This is all crazy anyway. Death\u0027s only to be expected in a place like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeranabus is having difficulties with the window. The patches of light are slotting into place, but slowly. And while most of the patches he\u0027s joined together are pulsing at the same rate, some aren\u0027t. If he could see the lights, it would be simple, but he can\u0027t. He has to create the window using complicated, time-consuming spells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t understand why the magician and the others can\u0027t see the lights. They\u0027re more powerful and experienced than me. So why am I the only one who can view the assembly of the window?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I\u0027m pondering that, a few more patches of light slot into place. A shimmer runs through the panel. The various colours vibrate a few times in unison. Then they all turn yellow and stop pulsing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah!\" Beranabus grunts. He turns, claps his hands to get everyone\u0027s attention, then waves at the window of yellow light, now visible for all to see. Raz and Sharmila approach with suspicion. Nadia hangs back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know what is through there?\" Sharmila asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Another world,\" Beranabus says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you be more specific?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs. \"I was searching for Cadaver, not a specific world. Until we pass through the window, I\u0027ve no way of telling where we\u0027ll emerge.\" He raises a bushy eyebrow. \"Nervous, Miss Mukherji?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nadia told us about her vision,\" Raz mutters, gaze lowered. \"About the Kah-Gash and your quest. She said there would be fighting and death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeranabus snorts. \"That girl should learn to keep her mouth shut.\" He glares at Nadia, then shrugs. \"You chance death every time you face a demon. That\u0027s nothing new.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we have been told that on this occasion it definitely lies in wait,\" Sharmila says. \"That is different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really,\" Beranabus says. \"Nadia has no idea who will die. It could be anyone - you, her, me, the boy. Maybe it will be all of us.\" Beranabus looks at the window and scowls. \"You can quit if you wish. I\u0027ve no time for cowards. But consider this - the Kah-Gash can destroy a universe. If you withdraw and the piece of the weapon we\u0027re chasing falls into the hands of the Demonata...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really believe the Kah-Gash exists?\" Sharmila asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharmila and Raz share an uneasy glance then Raz nods, followed - after a pause of several seconds - by Sharmila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about you, Fleck?\" Beranabus turns his small dark eyes on me. This is the first really close look I\u0027ve had of him. His skin is pale, but covered in dirt and grime. Lots of wrinkles, and a few old scars and blemishes. Untidy black hair, clumps of grey and white, his beard trimmed unevenly. His hands are clean, in contrast with the rest of him, but the tight flesh round his knuckles is covered by lots of blotches and faded scars. Dusty, dirty clothes. He wears a small flower in a buttonhole on his jacket, which looks pathetically out of place. Several of his teeth are missing, and the rest are crooked and rotten. He smells bad, like something that has half decomposed. I don\u0027t like him and I don\u0027t trust him. But he\u0027s the only hope I have of finding Art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m coming,\" I say, trying to sound more positive than I feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then it\u0027s decided,\" Beranabus says and steps through the yellow window. Sharmila follows, then Nadia - reluctantly, chin low.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaz claps me on the back. \"After you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI face the window of yellow light. Think about the demons that might be waiting on the other side. Take a breath. Hold it. Step through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA desert world. It\u0027s night, but lots of stars are glittering, so I can see clearly in all directions. Beranabus is magically searching for Cadaver, standing very still, eyes closed. After a few minutes he shakes his head. \"He\u0027s been through here but didn\u0027t stop.\" Rolling his shoulders, he spits on his hands, scuffs the sand with his feet, then starts on another spell, to open a new window and follow the demon to whatever world it fled to next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe patches of light round us are glowing steadily when Beranabus begins. Soon after he starts searching for Cadaver, several pulse and move towards a spot in front of him. As he chants, more pulse and others drift in from afar to be added to the patchwork panel. Beranabus is piecing them together with spells. But if he could see them like I could, and move them directly by hand...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think about offering my help, but I\u0027m afraid he\u0027ll laugh at me, so I keep my idea to myself. After a while I realise it\u0027s been ages since I ate or drank, yet I don\u0027t feel hungry or thirsty. I mention this to Raz, who\u0027s lying on the sand close by, idly gouging out shapes with a finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I noticed that too,\" he says. \"And although I have been here a day or two, I don\u0027t feel sleepy. Our bodies must work differently in this universe. It is a place of magic and you can do many incredible things with magic.\" He waves a hand over the sand and a sandcastle slowly thrusts upwards, turrets, a moat, tiny sandy guards on the ramparts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cool!\" I gasp. \"Do you think I could...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try,\" he says. \"I didn\u0027t know I could do that until just now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcited, I sit and think about a castle even bigger and grander than Raz\u0027s. I wave a hand over the sand, summoning my masterpiece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisappointed, I decide I\u0027m being too ambitious, so I picture a smaller castle, with fewer turrets and troops. Again, nothing happens. I keep lowering my expectations, demanding less and less, until finally I ask for the simplest sandcastle possible. The sand ripples, then spits up a meagre glob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaz laughs. \"Don\u0027t worry. Gifts vary. Magic shows itself uniquely in each person. I can create sandcastles. Perhaps you can change shape or make rain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes and think about what sort of an animal I\u0027d like to turn into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater. No luck with the shape-changing or making rain. If I have a magical gift, it must be very unique!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeranabus is hard at work on the window, which seems to be nearing completion. I\u0027m lying next to Nadia, Sharmila and Raz close by. Nadia\u0027s been telling us about her life with Beranabus, the ways of demons, how to fight them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are they all?\" I ask during a lull. \"This is the second world I\u0027ve been to, and apart from the trees, I haven\u0027t seen any demons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a hurry to spot some?\" Sharmila chuckles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I was just wondering. Where do they live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They could be anywhere,\" Nadia says. \"Beneath the sand. All around us and invisible. On the other side of the world. There might be thousands here or only one. It varies. Some demons create a world just for themselves. Others - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Demons can create worlds?\" Raz interrupts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The stronger ones can. Most just rampage through existing realms, but demon masters have the power to make new worlds and even self-contained universes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do they make the stars as well?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNadia smiles grimly. \"Those aren\u0027t stars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stare at her then up at the sky. It\u0027s peppered with glowing dots. They\u0027re not like the stars in our universe - they\u0027re bigger, brighter, closer, and many move across the heavens like meteors. But they can\u0027t be anything other than...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re demons,\" Nadia says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They can\u0027t be!\" Sharmila protests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nevertheless, they are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But...\" Sharmila gazes up at the sky, horrified. \"To be able to see them from here... they must be enormous!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are they demon masters?\" Raz asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few, perhaps, but most are just incredibly large demons who sail the skies, looking for others to torture and destroy. They don\u0027t usually bother with the likes of us - we\u0027re too tiny - but occasionally one might decide to squash us like ants.\" She chuckles humourlessly. \"When that happens, you get out as quick as you can. There\u0027s nothing else you can do against a star-sized demon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gawp at Nadia, then at the sky, filled with monstrous shapes. Suddenly, this place feels a lot more dangerous than it did a few minutes ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next world is a giant, needle-shaped chunk of rock. The top is flat and lumpy, sixty or seventy feet in diameter. A hot wind howls round it, biting at us, threatening to rip us loose and cast us over the edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeranabus curses and crouches. We copy him. \"I\u0027ve been here before,\" he says, speaking as quietly as he can, yet loud enough to be heard over the howling wind. \"It wasn\u0027t somewhere I ever wanted to return to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe anxiety in his tone affects us all, even Nadia, who starts murmuring the words of a spell - I think it\u0027s meant to protect us, or at least her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll keep the window to the other world open as long as possible,\" Beranabus says. \"That way, if we come under attack, we can...\" He stops. The yellow window of light has blinked out of existence. Beranabus growls and a look of disgust crosses his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s happening, master?\" Raz asks nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve been ensnared,\" Beranabus says, rolling up the sleeves of his jacket and shirt. \"Cadaver\u0027s led us into a trap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he here?\" Sharmila asks, looking round uneasily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. He\u0027s not welcome in this place. But he must have tipped off the Kallin. They were waiting for us. They destroyed the window.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are the Kallin?\" Raz yells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crawl to the edge,\" Beranabus says, turning away from us and sitting cross-legged. \"Have a look. Nadia,\" he adds, \"marshal them. Help them fight. Buy me time. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll be able to open a new window fast enough, but let\u0027s not die cheaply.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe starts muttering spells, lips moving at a tremendous speed. Around him, patches of light pulse and blink, then move together, a bit faster than before, but not greatly so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe look at each other then crawl towards the edge of the needle. The wind increases as we get closer. We lie flat on our stomachs, inching forward. I feel sick. I don\u0027t want to look over the edge. But I must.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t suffer from vertigo, which is good because it\u0027s a long drop. And I mean L-O-N-G! I can\u0027t see the base of the needle. It seems to be suspended in mid-air, and for all I know, it is. We\u0027re in a universe of demonic magic. Who says giant needles of rock need to be rooted to the ground?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the stomach-churning drop isn\u0027t the worst thing. Slithering up the face of the rock are... things. Hundreds and thousands of small, long, black, hairy, spider-like creatures. Except they can\u0027t be spiders because they have no legs. They move more like worms. Slithering towards us, an army of them. The Kallin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the monsters leans back and raises its face to us. I see dozens of tiny eyes and a wide mouth. As I watch, the mouth stretches like a snake\u0027s, the thing opening its jaws far wider than its body. There are fangs inside the mouth. More than I can count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething taps my shoulder. I scream, whipping round. But it\u0027s only Nadia. She grabs me before I roll off the top of the needle, drags me away from the edge to where Sharmila and Raz are waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re in trouble,\" she says simply. \"There are thousands, so we can\u0027t fight them. Our best hope is to block them. That means a barrier of energy, to keep them back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will that work?\" Raz asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll soon find out. Now, we have a few minutes, so let\u0027s see what we have to work with. I want each of you to create a personal barrier. Imagine yourself at the centre of a bubble of energy. Let your magic flow into it. Once I have an idea of your power, I can coordinate a spell and unite our magic forces.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSharmila and Raz close their eyes and focus. I don\u0027t have a clue what I\u0027m doing, but I follow their lead. I concentrate, trying not to think about the Kallin, willing a barrier into place, praying I have more success than with the sandcastle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few seconds later Nadia says, \"Let\u0027s see what we have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open my eyes and spot her throwing a punch at Raz. Her fist stops several inches short of his face. She tries again - same result. She grunts with satisfaction. Jabs at Sharmila. Her fist slows but doesn\u0027t stop. Lightly smacks into Sharmila\u0027s chin, not harming her but getting through the barrier. \"Try to strengthen it,\" Nadia says. Jabs a second time. Again, she penetrates Sharmila\u0027s barrier, but with more difficulty. Pulls a so-so face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you,\" she says to me. Makes a fist, starts to throw a punch... then stops. Sticks out her right index finger. Pokes at me softly. Prods my nose. Smiles. \"Guess you\u0027re out of this one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not my fault,\" I grumble. \"I\u0027m not used to magic. I don\u0027t know how to make it work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s OK.\" She tweaks my nose. \"You can be our second line of defence. Watch for any demons getting through. If one penetrates the barrier, do your best to kill it while we plug up the hole it creates.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do I kill them?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With magic. You can stamp on them, choke them, firebolts of energy - whatever comes most naturally to you. But there has to be magic as well. You can\u0027t kill a demon by physical force alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if I can\u0027t make it work? What if - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kernel!\" she snaps. \"We don\u0027t have time for hysterics. Just do your best, like when you escaped from the demon tree.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe draws Sharmila and Raz aside to prepare them. While they\u0027re discussing magical barriers, I creep to the edge of the needle to monitor the advance of the Kallin. They\u0027re a lot closer than a couple of minutes ago. Not so small now that I have a better view of them. Two or three feet long. Making soft squeaking noises, barely audible over the roar of the wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think about throwing myself off, taking the easy way out, not waiting for them to clamber over me and rip at me with their fangs. One short step or leap... a few seconds or minutes of freefall... then no more worries. Unless there\u0027s nothing to freefall to. Maybe there\u0027s no ground in this part of the Demonata\u0027s universe. I might bob back up or fall forever, a lifetime of falling... screaming... thrashing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re almost to the top!\" I shout, putting the dark thoughts behind me. \"Half a minute and they\u0027ll be all over us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get back here,\" Sharmila calls. They\u0027ve gathered close to Beranabus, who\u0027s concentrating on the slowly forming window. I crouch next to Raz, feeling safer beside him than Sharmila, since he was able to construct a stronger barrier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here we go,\" Nadia says shakily. She half closes her eyes. So do Sharmila and Raz. There\u0027s a shimmer in the air a couple of feet in front of us. Then nothing. I wonder if the spell has worked, if we\u0027re protected or not. Then the first of the Kallin wriggles over the edge of the needle and launches itself at us, mouth wide, fangs bared, screeching with hunger and hate. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/demon-thief-the-demonata-2/page-9.html","bookId":2176,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:43:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:43:22 PM"}
