Thus, you must quickly head over.” The Flame Master said. The ripples from his body were growing increasingly intense.

Since such a great disturbance had occurred in the Chaotic Demon Sea, he needed to go over and make sure the Gu Clan, Tang Xinlian, Mu Lingshan and the rest were alright. If the Chaotic Demon Sea was affected, the places they were at would not be spared.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter saying what he needed to, the Flame Master’s gaze turned towards Ying Huanhuan. He hesitated for a while before speaking, “I’m afraid that I cannot continue to stay at your side this time.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eYing Huanhuan lightly nodded her head.

Soon after, flames suddenly emerged on his body. When the flames faded, his body had disappeared.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong knew that the Flame Master had retrieved this avatar of his. Looks like the danger this time was indeed not small.

Now that Devil Prison has put all of their efforts into the Chaotic Demon Sea, the Eastern Xuan Region should be safe for the time being.” Lin Dong did not hesitate. He tilted his head towards Ying Xuanzi and said.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Brother Lin Dong, bring me along too! I still haven’t been to the Chaotic Demon Sea!” Qingtan hastily said.

After pondering for \u0026nbsp;a moment, he nodded his head. Qingtan was the Darkness Ancestral Symbol controller and wielded the Darkness Saint Scythe. Hence she would be able to engage in battle with even a true king level Yimo king. Moreover, even he could not really tell how powerful Ying Huanhuan currently was, and she would contribute greatly to their battle power if she came along. Most importantly, he would worry if he left her behind by herself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Then the three of us shall go.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eQingtan immediately smiled happily when she heard this. Even her pretty little face had become substantially more sweet and charming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Since that is so, then go. Remember to take care of each other.” Ying Xuanzi nodded his head. Given this trio’s strength, they could go anywhere in this world. There was not much need to worry about them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Sect leader, Dao Sect should seal off itself for the time being after we leave incase anything should happen. Let me know if any problem crops up. Now that I have refined the Spatial Ancestral Symbol, I will be able to quickly return here.” Lin Dong said. Although Devil Prison’s power was concentrated in the Chaotic Demon Sea, there was no harm in being careful.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Okay.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eYing Xuanzi nodded and responded.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eUpon seeing this, Lin Dong no longer delayed. His arms reached out and grabbed Ying Huanhuan and Qingtan. Of the two slim waists, one was as soft as a snake while the other was ice-cold like jade, a feeling that made one feel a somewhat reluctant to part with.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, Lin Dong currently did not have to mood to enjoy this sensation. With a thought, silver light exploded from his body as the surrounding space started to violently distort.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eCh!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhen the silver light faded, everyone saw that the three figures had already disappeared into the distorted space and only violent spatial undulations remained.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eYing Xuanzi watched the trio disappear as he gently spit out a mouthful of air.
