THE LAND OF CULTURE.","content":"Too far did I fly into the future: a horror seized upon me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And when I looked around me, lo! there time was my sole contemporary.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then did I fly backwards, homewards—and always faster. Thus did I come unto you, ye present-day men, and into the land of culture.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For the first time brought I an eye to see you, and good desire: verily, with longing in my heart did I come.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But how did it turn out with me? Although so alarmed—I had yet to laugh! Never did mine eye see anything so motley-coloured!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I laughed and laughed, while my foot still trembled, and my heart as well. “Here forsooth, is the home of all the paintpots,”—said I.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With fifty patches painted on faces and limbs—so sat ye there to mine astonishment, ye present-day men!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And with fifty mirrors around you, which flattered your play of colours, and repeated it!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Verily, ye could wear no better masks, ye present-day men, than your own faces! Who could—RECOGNISE you!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Written all over with the characters of the past, and these characters also pencilled over with new characters—thus have ye concealed yourselves well from all decipherers!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And though one be a trier of the reins, who still believeth that ye have reins! Out of colours ye seem to be baked, and out of glued scraps.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All times and peoples gaze divers-coloured out of your veils; all customs and beliefs speak divers-coloured out of your gestures.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He who would strip you of veils and wrappers, and paints and gestures, would just have enough left to scare the crows.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Verily, I myself am the scared crow that once saw you naked, and without paint; and I flew away when the skeleton ogled at me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Rather would I be a day-labourer in the nether-world, and among the shades of the by-gone!—Fatter and fuller than ye, are forsooth the nether-worldlings!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This, yea this, is bitterness to my bowels, that I can neither endure you naked nor clothed, ye present-day men!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All that is unhomelike in the future, and whatever maketh strayed birds shiver, is verily more homelike and familiar than your “reality.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For thus speak ye: “Real are we wholly, and without faith and superstition”: thus do ye plume yourselves—alas! even without plumes!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Indeed, how would ye be ABLE to believe, ye divers-coloured ones!—ye who are pictures of all that hath ever been believed!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Perambulating refutations are ye, of belief itself, and a dislocation of all thought. UNTRUSTWORTHY ONES: thus do I call you, ye real ones!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All periods prate against one another in your spirits; and the dreams and pratings of all periods were even realer than your awakeness!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Unfruitful are ye: THEREFORE do ye lack belief. But he who had to create, had always his presaging dreams and astral premonitions—and believed in believing!—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Half-open doors are ye, at which grave-diggers wait. And this is YOUR reality: “Everything deserveth to perish.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Alas, how ye stand there before me, ye unfruitful ones; how lean your ribs! And many of you surely have had knowledge thereof.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Many a one hath said: “There hath surely a God filched something from me secretly whilst I slept? Verily, enough to make a girl for himself therefrom!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Amazing is the poverty of my ribs!” thus hath spoken many a present-day man.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Yea, ye are laughable unto me, ye present-day men! And especially when ye marvel at yourselves!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And woe unto me if I could not laugh at your marvelling, and had to swallow all that is repugnant in your platters!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As it is, however, I will make lighter of you, since I have to carry what is heavy; and what matter if beetles and May-bugs also alight on my load!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Verily, it shall not on that account become heavier to me! And not from you, ye present-day men, shall my great weariness arise.—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ah, whither shall I now ascend with my longing! From all mountains do I look out for fatherlands and motherlands.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But a home have I found nowhere: unsettled am I in all cities, and decamping at all gates.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Alien to me, and a mockery, are the present-day men, to whom of late my heart impelled me; and exiled am I from fatherlands and motherlands.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thus do I love only my CHILDREN’S LAND, the undiscovered in the remotest sea: for it do I bid my sails search and search.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Unto my children will I make amends for being the child of my fathers: and unto all the future—for THIS present-day!—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thus spake Zarathustra.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2158/61051.html","bookId":445,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 2:08:22 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 2:08:22 PM"}
