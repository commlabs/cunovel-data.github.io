Jack sipped from his drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" Davette asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought about a reply, said, \"To understand that, you\u0027d first have to buy it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young girl glanced briefly away then back to him. \"Well, you have to admit it\u0027s pretty hard to believe.\" By God, I think she does believe! Jack thought suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr at least she\u0027s trying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What put you onto us, anyway?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"An old friend of my family owns the weekly newspaper that covered your last... uh, mission. I got into that little town, what\u0027s it called?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bradshaw, Indiana.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Bradshaw. Anyway, I got there two days after you\u0027d left.\" She frowned. \"Nobody would talk about it by then. But I got your address.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lucky you weren\u0027t on time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard you\u0027d had some trouble.\" He took a sip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyone hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was it serious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dead. Seven dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went pale. \"You\u0027re joking! You can\u0027t be serious!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just looked at her. \"Okay,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were quiet for several seconds. She could tell he meant it. And he could tell it had gotten to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, he said, \"Let me give you a little advice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is real.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they were quiet again for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last she said, \"I don\u0027t know what to say. Or do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped away from the wall, shrugging off the somber mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you what you can do. If you ever get this story printed anywhere - which I frankly doubt - you can put this in it.\" He drained his glass and set it down on the carpet. \"Got your pad with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tape recorder,\" she answered. She dug quickly in her purse, produced it, and held it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okey doke.\" He stuck a cigarette in his grinning teeth, lit it. \"I\u0027ll give you the grand tour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled back, gestured about her. \"It\u0027s certainly a big house. How many bedrooms?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seven too many.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" she said quietly, gazing down the row of empty rooms. Four on one side. Three on the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t despair,\" he said. \"It\u0027s just eulogy time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he did something she knew she would never, for all the rest of her life, forget. Grinning all the while, chain-smoking like mad, he strode from room to room and in each one told one outrageous, impossible, hopelessly funny and (invariably) obscene story about each of its martyred occupants. Smiling, but unable to really laugh along with him, she padded along behind gazing, transfixed, by his every word and gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack Crow cried easily, readily, as he spoke. But without choking or moaning or even allowing it to interfere with his own laughter. His tone went up and down, was pretend-serious or pretend-drunk or pretend - little boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was utterly hypnotized throughout by his blazing pride in his lost team. No. She would never ever forget this. Jack seemed to enjoy it as well. And he seemed to understand her reaction for the compliment it was. He spent an hour and a half being animated and dramatic and hilarious and when he had finished they were both exhausted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCat appeared in the hallway and reminded him their plane was ready to fly and then was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to her and told her where they were going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said she knew. She said she was from there. From Dallas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said he missed Texas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo did she, she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long pause. Downstairs, rock and roll began thumping from somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen why don\u0027t you come along? was his next question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at him, her head tilted to hear the muffled sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will,\" she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she did. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire/page-6.html","bookId":2118,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:59:08 PM"}
