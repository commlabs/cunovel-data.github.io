You can usually find me either at home or at the public library, where I work. I\u0027ve lived in this town all my life and raised two daughters here. But my husband and I - well, about six months ago, he disappeared. Just…disappeared. Where\u0027s Dan? Why did he go? Who\u0027s he with? Will I ever find out? \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eMy hometown, my family and friends, bring me comfort during this difficult time. Comfort and a sense of shelter. I\u0027m continually reminded that life can and does go on. For instance, everyone\u0027s been discussing weddings and babies lately. Justine - the only daughter of my best friend, Olivia Lockhart - impulsively got married a little while ago. My own daughter Kelly recently had a baby. Unfortunately, she refuses to accept that Dan might not return to see his first grandchild. My older daughter, Maryellen, is more realistic. I think she\u0027s seeing a new man, but for some reason she won\u0027t tell me who it is. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eThen there\u0027s Jack, who\u0027s been pursuing a romance with Olivia, and his son, Eric, and Eric\u0027s girlfriend, Shelly (I think she\u0027s pregnant), and Zach and Rosemary Cox, whose marriage is reputedly on the skids and…Well, just come on over and we\u0027ll talk! \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eGrace\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/204-rosewood-lane-cedar-cove-2.jpg","author":"Debbie Macomber","type":"Romance","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/204-rosewood-lane-cedar-cove-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:09 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:42 AM"}
