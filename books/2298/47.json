{"id":93640,"no":47,"title":"Page 47","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter eight days and nights of \"should I or shouldn\u0027t I,\" Vickie called Gus and quit her job. She withdrew her savings from the bank. She called the utility companies and turned off the gas, water, electricity, and the phone. She didn\u0027t tell Bobbie Sue where she was going for fear that her friend might talk her out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed up her house and then, without a backward glance, she hopped into her car and went in search of her vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 38\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAntonio prowled the empty rooms and lonely halls of the castle like a caged beast. He had done what was best for Victoria, that was the important thing. No matter that he felt as though his heart had been torn from his chest, or that he had given up his best reason for existing. He loved her with his whole being and because he loved her, he had let her go. In time, he would forget her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed harshly, humorlessly. Time. If there was one thing he had in abundance, it was time. And never had it passed so slowly. Every day without Victoria seemed like an eternity. He took no pleasure in rising, or in feeding. He had growled at Lady Kathryn so often she had gone into hiding, leaving him more alone than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlone and in darkness. Strange, he thought, he had lived for centuries cloaked in the shadows of the night, but he had never realized how dark his life was until the light of Victoria\u0027s love was no longer there to illuminate his heart and soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVictoria. Her scent filled every room in the castle. Her memory filled his every waking thought. He started to go after her a hundred times, but he always turned back. No matter how much he regretted letting her go, it was for the best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swore under his breath. Whose best? Not his! Never his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid she ever think of him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad she found someone else?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slammed his fist against the wall. Pain vibrated up his arm. Blood oozed from his knuckles. He hit the wall again and again, breaking through paint, plaster and mortar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drew his arm back, ready to strike again, when he heard a knock at the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrowning, he glanced over his shoulder. Who would be coming to call at this hour of the night? He laughed humorlessly. Who would be coming to call on him at any hour?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wrenched the door open, his angry words dying in his throat when he saw her standing there. He shook his head, unable to believe his eyes. He had dreamed of her, thought of her, yearned for her for so long, he was sure his lonely heart had conjured her image. An indrawn breath carried her scent to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill unconvinced, he stroked her cheek. Soft feminine flesh, warm with life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Victoria?\" She wore a pair of jeans that clung to her like a second skin, a black knit sweater, and a pair of fur-lined boots. Her hair fell over her shoulders in shimmering chestnut waves. In six hundred and twelve years, he had never seen anything more beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Antonio.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" He drank in the sight of her. What difference did it make why she was here? She was here, and that was all that mattered. He thanked a generous Fate for allowing him to see her one more time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to invite me in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped back. \"You need no invitation. You will always be welcome in my home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crossed the threshold, and he followed her into the parlor. His hungry gaze moved over her, every fiber of his being yearning toward her. \"Is something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to face him. \"That depends on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"I do not understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you love me, Antonio?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know that I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you know that I love you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have been through this before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to spend the rest of my life with you,\" she said, moving toward him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought of a hundred reasons why he should send her away, but when he tried to put them into words, they no longer made sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you share your life with me, Antonio?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnable to deny the urgings of his own heart any longer, he nodded. Right or wrong, he wanted her, all of her, for however long she was willing to put up with him and his unnatural lifestyle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I asked Ramsey to bring me across.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words slammed into him with the force of a stake through the heart. He stared at her, too stunned to speak. Opening his senses, he searched for some hint of supernatural power. To his relief, he found none.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki shrugged. \"He wouldn\u0027t do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" he asked incredulously. \"Why on earth would you ask him to do such a thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him as if he weren\u0027t too bright. \"Because I want to be what you are, of course. Because it\u0027s the only way we can ever truly be together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was right to refuse you,\" Antonio said. \"A decision like that— \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said you should do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAntonio stared at her, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you? Or will I have to search the world for a vampire who will bring me across?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are determined to do this thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Very.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My warrior woman.\" He drew her into his arms. \"You must be sure, sweeting. Once it is done, it cannot be undone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure. I\u0027ve thought about it for weeks and weeks.\" She looked up at him, frowning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do know how to do it, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I know how, though I have never made another vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is no hurry. When you are ready, let me know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m ready now. I want to share your life, all of it. I don\u0027t want to waste a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will not age. Are you sure this is the age you wish to be from now on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about that. She was twenty-two, old enough to know what she wanted. She could wait a year or two or five and still be young, but what if something happened to her while she was waiting? She was in good health now, but could get deathly ill or hit by a truck or, heaven forbid, become the target of another madman with a penchant for redheads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swept her into his arms and carried her up the stairs to the bedroom. At his nod, a fire sprang to life in the hearth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGently, he placed her on the bed, then sat down beside her and drew her into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at him, her eyes wide. \"Are you going to bite me now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but there is more to it than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will it hurt?\" she asked tremulously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said, and then he explained how it was done, that he would take her blood and then she would take his. Her earthly body would die and when she awoke, she would be as he was, a creature of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you still sure this is what you want?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must remove your crucifix.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki wrapped her hand around the thick silver cross. She had worn it for almost as long as she could remember. How could she take it off?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe read the pain and confusion in her eyes. And waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will I still feel the same about everything when I\u0027m a vampire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is up to you. You need not surrender your faith or your beliefs. There are priests and rabbis among the Undead. They are men who did not ask for the Dark Gift, but who have adjusted to it and manage to continue to live their religion, though slightly modified. Becoming a vampire is like mortal death. Whatever a man is in this life is what he takes with him into the next world. The same is true of becoming a vampire. A man who was a liar when he was alive will be a liar when he is turned, just as an honest man will remain an honest man when he becomes a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought that over for a moment and then she removed the cross and chain and wrapped it in a hanky she pulled from the pocket of her jeans. She held it tightly for a moment and then placed it in the back of the bottom dresser drawer. When she closed the drawer, she knew she had also closed a door on one chapter of her life. Tonight, a new chapter would begin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked deep into Antonio\u0027s eyes, dark blue eyes filled with love and hope, and then she sat down beside him and kissed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a low groan, he tightened his arms around her. He fell back on the bed, carrying her with him, his mouth working its familiar magic, carrying her to places she had never been before, making her forget everything but her need for this man in her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt the brush of his fangs against her neck, a sudden rush of heat followed by waves of intense pleasure. She knew a moment of fear as all the strength seemed to leave her body. The world grew dark, and she was falling, falling, her hold on life growing weaker as she fell into the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she heard Antonio\u0027s voice calling her back, telling her that he loved her, that she must fight to live. Must drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed something warm to her mouth and she drank, drank his life and his memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sleep now, my sweetest one.\" His hand stroked her brow. \"When you awake tomorrow, I will show you the world as you have never seen it before. Sleep… \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFilled with an aching tenderness, Antonio gazed at the woman in his arms. He had not prayed since he was turned, but he prayed now, prayed fervently that he had not made a terrible mistake, that she would not hate him for doing what she had asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wiped the blood from her mouth. Though he had never slept in this bed, he knew Victoria would not want to awake in a coffin; indeed, he had a feeling he would be taking his rest in a bed from now on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter removing her shoes, he tucked her under the covers, fully clothed, and then he went through the castle, making certain all the wards were in place. They would sleep here tonight; tomorrow, he would move the bed to a more secure location. But tonight…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight, for the first time in his preternatural life, he would take his rest beside a woman he loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonight, he thought as he stretched out beside her. Tonight, and for all his tomorrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t want to wake up. She felt warm and secure and at peace for the first time in her life. Sighing, she turned onto her side, remembering the dream she\u0027d had the night before. It was very like the dreams she\u0027d had before, the ones with the golden goblet, only this time she had been the one to drink the contents, and in doing so, she had become a vampire. One of the Undead. A creature of the night. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/desire-after-dark-vampire-trilogy-3/page-47.html","bookId":2298,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:03:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:03:24 PM"}
