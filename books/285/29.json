As it was, he had already come to the conclusion that his railroad acquaintance was a sharper.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will trouble you to prove your claim to it,\" said Luke, not at all disturbed by Coleman\u0027s impudent assertion.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I gave it to you yesterday to place in the safe.
