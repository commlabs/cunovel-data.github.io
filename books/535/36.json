{"id":21436,"no":36,"title":"Chapter 36","content":"Peter blundered away into the streets, an outcast. He walked furiously about, getting in the way of people who looked for pleasure.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He lived again the late encounter. Remotely he saw himself quietly at the feet of Lady Mary, before he had lost his happy peace. Then the storm was loose, and he saw her merely as one to be desired and held. Finally, his imagination inexorably came full circle in the cold shame with which he had left her. He repeated continually the moment when his kisses had gone out, and he knew them for the vulgar gust of his jealousy. Their passion had not been true. Lady Mary had cried in bitter verity. They dishonoured her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Was all the story equally a falsehood? Peter dipped for assurance back into the quiet past. He floated again with Lady Mary under a dying sky, and saw her unattainably fair, with a hand that quietly rested under his. Surely this had been wonderful. Not even the stain of his brutal hunger for her dedicated beauty could destroy it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Why, then, did he so certainly know that his passion to-night was evil? His conscience, bringing him to a reckoning, told him that he did not love her. There was a rift, not to be closed, between his adoration of Lady Mary and the passion with which he had thought to claim her. He put[Pg 270] Wenderby aside, and asked himself whether he could ever have taken her by right of a vital need. His imagination would not allow him to do so. He could only see himself for ever kneeling, or delicately touching her as an exquisite privilege. He could not again repeat the physical claim. Mere coveting had prompted it. The soul had perished on his lips.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e How instantly she had read the quality of his act. Every beat of the quick moment of his taking her was minutely divided in his memory. He felt again her surrender, her expectation of the kiss she could not deny—the farewell moment of her youth to be expiated in years of sacrifice. Then suddenly she had rebelled, feeling the soul go out of him, protesting against her dishonour.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Peter quailed to think how he had tortured her. He knew now that Lady Mary loved him. She had been outraged where most she was virginal.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For a moment Peter caught at a hope that yet the mysterious rift might close between the soul and body of his love. Must he always be thus divided? Was he never to know a perfect passion where the blood ran in obedient rapture to celebrate the meeting of two in one? He remembered the beautiful girl he had tracked on a summer night, to shrink from taking her because his spirit was her enemy. Now that he in spirit loved Lady Mary—he insistently fought through to-day\u0027s murk back to his adoration—he was still divided. His moment of hope died out. He had no right[Pg 271] to Lady Mary. He could not passionately claim her. His passion would fail again, as to-night it had failed, leaving only the senses to be fed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He did not love her. Brutally it came to that. Lady Mary must take the way she had herself appointed. She could not be asked to put away the work of her life in return for a worship that fed upon the air, or for a hunger that seized on a vanishing feast. Himself he felt entirely in her hands. He hoped to be forgiven, and accepted as the witness of her dedicated life. But he did not expect it, or make a claim.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He reached Curzon Street at ten o\u0027clock, and found his mother returned from dining out. Mrs. Paragon now had her own friends. She quietly came and went, usually not asking how Peter fared. All his time was taken up with Lady Mary, and with Lady Mary she left the issue in perfect trust. But to-night she was startled from her assurance. Peter, unaware that he betrayed himself, had the face of a soul newly admitted to damnation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What has happened to you, Peter?\" she asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Nothing, mother.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She came to him where he had flung himself into a chair beside the fire.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Has Lady Mary sent you away?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Peter stared at her in amazement. He had never talked of Lady Mary. But he always accepted his mother\u0027s mysterious knowledge.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She is soon to be married, mother.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 272]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Lord Wenderby?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This was more than Peter could accept.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You know that also?\" he exclaimed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I saw Lord Wenderby one day in these rooms,\" said his mother quietly. \"I knew he was in love with Lady Mary.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Peter looked keenly at his mother.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are sure he loves her?\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Quite.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I should be happy to believe that. It gives him a better claim.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Better than your own?\" said his mother. She was at last surprised.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have no claim at all. I do not love Lady Mary.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was quaintly wretched. His mother almost smiled. She saw a light in the cloud, but it puzzled her. Would he then have preferred to love Lady Mary and to lose her?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Tell me what has happened,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t understand. You do not love Lady Mary—is that your trouble?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She told me of Lord Wenderby,\" Peter obediently answered, \"and I was mad at the idea of losing her. I grasped at her. I was like a wild beast.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But you do not love her,\" Mrs. Paragon persisted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It was not love made me behave like that. It was brutal. I had no true passion at all. I disgusted her.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 273]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Paragon suddenly rose.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What has Lady Mary said? How did she part from you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Peter looked at her in wonder. What was his mother going to do now?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She said she would write,\" he answered. \"Her eyes were closed.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Paragon saw that this was not Peter\u0027s tragedy. She could leave him to his remorse.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Give me my cloak, Peter.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where are you going?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Paragon ignored his question.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What is Lady Mary doing now?\" she asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She promised to wait for Antony. The division to-night is at eleven o\u0027clock.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Paragon looked at the clock.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is now half-past ten. Call me a cab, Peter.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are going to her?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On the way to Arlington Street Mrs. Paragon saw the radiant figure of the woman, to whom she had trusted Peter, in dreadful eclipse. She passed without a word Lady Mary\u0027s protesting servant, and went directly to her room. Lady Mary still lay with closed eyes where she had been struck down. Mrs. Paragon moved quietly towards her, and gathered her like a child. She opened her eyes, accepting Peter\u0027s mother with a clasp of the hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You have seen Peter?\" she quietly asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 274]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He has just come home. He says he has for ever offended you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Mary smiled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I will send him a word to-night,\" she said. \"I have just been trying to understand. I think I shall soon be happy. I know now that Peter does not love me. That makes it so much easier.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"He worships you,\" Mrs. Paragon insisted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can that be restored?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"More than ever now. I am sure he would want me to tell you that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Mary raised herself from Mrs. Paragon\u0027s shoulder and looked at her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I cannot yet measure this breach in Peter. He has loved me from the moment we came together at Highbury. But to-night I was humbled. There was no love at all. I cannot now believe that Peter will ever truly love. There is a rift.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are wrong,\" said Peter\u0027s mother.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Paragon told Lady Mary how lately she had watched beside him as he wandered in an empty house. Lady Mary heard the story of Miranda.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think he is wandering still,\" concluded Peter\u0027s mother.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You should have found this girl,\" said Lady Mary.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Paragon paused a moment.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have tried,\" she said at last.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can\u0027t she be traced?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You remember the great liner that went down[Pg 275] four years ago? She was not on the list of people saved.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"When did you discover this?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I inquired shortly after Peter\u0027s illness.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Mary thought a little.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Perhaps it is better so,\" she said after a pause.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why do you say that?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Peter has surely grown away from these people. He would not have found his dream.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A shutting door warned Lady Mary that her brother had returned. She rose from the settee, and went to the writing table. When she had finished her few lines, she gave them to Mrs. Paragon, who, asking Lady Mary with a look, was invited to read them:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Peter,—I beg you not to distress yourself. I am determined to forget what happened this evening, and I rely on you not to brood on things which are finished. You know now that I am more than ever right to become the wife of Lord Wenderby. I want you to meet me without awkwardness or self-reproach. There is no need for one or the other. Nothing has changed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I am sending this by your dear mother.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Mary.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Paragon handed back the sheet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You are kind,\" she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have nothing to resent.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She sealed the letter, and addressed it. \"When[Pg 276] Peter has got over his remorse, you will bring him back,\" she suggested.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"His remorse is too keen to last,\" Mrs. Paragon said quite simply. She did not intend to be critical.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Mary kissed Mrs. Paragon tenderly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It was beautiful of you to come,\" she whispered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Peter was waiting for his mother, and met her anxiously at the door. Lady Mary\u0027s letter acted as she intended. It was a dash of water upon the fires of his despair. Reading her collected sentences, he could hardly believe he had seen love and pain unutterable in her eyes. She was, in her letter, restored to serenity as one to be remotely worshipped. An added majesty had crowned her. She was dedicated to a great historic part. Already as Mrs. Paragon returned, the news was spread from waiting presses that the Government had fallen. They screamed it in the street below. Now that his personal passion was out of the way, Peter began to see these issues in a large and national perspective. He remembered Haversham\u0027s vibrant wish that he might have had some share in this event—the event of which Lady Mary was motive and queen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Peter\u0027s recovery was rapid. Alternately the week through he wavered between the remorse of one who had erred unspeakably and the exultation of one still privileged to witness the flight of an angel. Then, one bright morning, he [Pg 277]discovered that these extremes had vanished in a quiet sense, that a chapter of his life had closed. Rapture was going out of his late adventure, making way for a steady sense that Lady Mary was very admirable and an excellent friend.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After a few days spent mostly with his mother, he was enough in tune with Lady Mary\u0027s letter to visit her in Arlington Street. Wenderby was waiting for her, and, before she came down to them, they were a few moments together. Peter was surprised at the cordiality of his feelings for the man he had so long distrusted. Wenderby had an instinct for meeting people in their own way. He at once saw the change in Peter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think you know of my engagement?\" he said abruptly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Has Lady Mary told you everything?\" Peter asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not everything,\" Wenderby answered with a faint smile. \"I have inferred the greater part.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You will be very proud of her,\" said Peter impulsively.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You believe that I understand my good fortune?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lady Mary came in as they spoke. Peter was astonished at the ease with which they talked together of small things. He tranquilly withdrew at the end of a few moments. Lady Mary was frank and free. She seemed entirely at peace. There had not been a sign of effort in her friendly greeting.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2063/58767.html","bookId":535,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 1:03:04 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 1:03:04 PM"}
