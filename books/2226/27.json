His calls to the escort agencies had turned up nothing. The commander, uneasy about communication over unsecured public phones, had asked David not to call again until he had the ring. Becker considered going to the local police for help-maybe they had a record of a red-headed hooker-but Strathmore had given strict orders about that too. You are invisible. No one is to know this ring exists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker wondered if he was supposed to wander the drugged-out district of Triana in search of this mystery woman. Or maybe he was supposed to check all the restaurants for an obese German. Everything seemed like a waste of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrathmore\u0027s words kept coming back: It\u0027s a matter of national security... you must find that ring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA voice in the back of Becker\u0027s head told him he\u0027d missed something-something crucial-but for the life of him, he couldn\u0027t think what it would be. I\u0027m a teacher, not a damned secret agent! He was beginning to wonder why Strathmore hadn\u0027t sent a professional.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker stood up and walked aimlessly down Calle Delicias pondering his options. The cobblestone sidewalk blurred beneath his gaze. Night was falling fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDewdrop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something about that absurd name that nagged at the back of his mind. Dewdrop. The slick voice of Senor Roldan at Escortes Belen was on endless loop in his head. \"We only have two redheads... Two redheads, Inmaculada and Rocio... Rocio... Rocio...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecker stopped short. He suddenly knew. And I call myself a language specialist? He couldn\u0027t believe he\u0027d missed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRocio was one of the most popular girl\u0027s names in Spain. It carried all the right implications for a young Catholic girl-purity, virginity, natural beauty. The connotations of purity all stemmed from the name\u0027s literal meaning-Drop of Dew!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old Canadian\u0027s voice rang in Becker\u0027s ears. Dewdrop. Rocio had translated her name to the only language she and her client had in common-English. Excited, Becker hurried off to find a phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAcross the street, a man in wire-rim glasses followed just out of sight. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/digital-fortress/page-27.html","bookId":2226,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:04:05 PM"}
