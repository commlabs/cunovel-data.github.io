From the knapsack that he always carried, he had taken a small handkerchief and on it he had placed two wine goblets. In the center was a small leather wine holder and, beside it, some cheese and some apples. The spot could not have been lovelier: a high point of the mountain path with a splendid view all the way back to Florin Channel. Buttercup lay helpless beside the picnic, gagged and tied and blindfolded. Vizzini held his long knife against her white throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Welcome,” Vizzini called when the man in black was almost upon them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in black stopped and surveyed the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve beaten my Turk,” Vizzini said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It would seem so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And now it is down to you. And it is down to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So that would seem too,” the man in black said, edging just a half-step closer to the hunchback’s long knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a smile the hunchback pushed the knife harder against Buttercup’s throat. It was about to bring blood. “If you wish her dead, by all means keep moving,” Vizzini said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in black froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Better,” Vizzini nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo sound now beneath the moonlight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand completely what you are trying to do,” the Sicilian said finally, “and I want it quite clear that I resent your behavior. You are trying to kidnap what I have rightfully stolen, and I think it quite ungentlemanly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me explain—” the man in black began, starting to edge forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re killing her!” the Sicilian screamed, shoving harder with the knife. A drop of blood appeared now at Buttercup’s throat, red against white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man in black retreated. “Let me explain,” he said again, but from a distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain the hunchback interrupted. “There is nothing you can tell me I do not already know. I have not had the schooling equal to some, but for knowledge outside of books, there is no one in the world close to me. People say I read minds, but that is not, in all honesty, true. I merely predict the truth using logic and wisdom, and I say you are a kidnapper, admit it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will admit that, as a ransom item, she has value; nothing more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have been instructed to do certain things to her. It is very important that I follow my instructions. If I do this properly, I will be in demand for life. And my instructions do not include ransom, they include death. So your explanations are meaningless; we cannot do business together. You wish to keep her alive for ransom, whereas it is terribly important to me that she stop breathing in the very near future.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Has it occurred to you that I have gone to great effort and expense, as well as personal sacrifice, to reach this point,” the man in black replied. “And that if I fail now, I might get very angry. And if she stops breathing in the very near future, it is entirely possible that you will catch the same fatal illness?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have no doubt you could kill me. Any man who can get by Inigo and Fezzik would have no trouble disposing of me. However, has it occurred to you that if you did that, then neither of us would get what we want—you having lost your ransom item, me my life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are at an impasse then,” said the man in black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I fear so,” said the Sicilian. “I cannot compete with you physically, and you are no match for my brains.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are that smart?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are no words to contain all my wisdom. I am so cunning, crafty and clever, so filled with deceit, guile and chicanery, such a knave, so shrewd, cagey as well as calculating, as diabolical as I am vulpine, as tricky as I am untrustworthy… well, I told you there were not words invented yet to explain how great my brain is, but let me put it this way: the world is several million years old and several billion people have at one time or another trod upon it, but I, Vizzini the Sicilian, am, speaking with pure candor and modesty, the slickest, sleekest, sliest and wiliest fellow who has yet come down the pike.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-62.html","bookId":1559,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM"}
