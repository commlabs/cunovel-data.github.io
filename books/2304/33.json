You’re a predator now. He’s prey. Take him!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShirl gazed into the frightened eyes of the man caught in the web of her embrace. She knew Tomás was watching her. How could she disappoint him again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExperiencing a moment of regret, she smoothed the man’s hair from his brow, then glanced at the woman on the blanket. Was she his girlfriend? His wife? Did they have children waiting for them at home? Feeling the weight of Tomás’s gaze, she thrust the troubling questions from her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a murmured, “I’m sorry,” she lowered her head, sank her fangs into the man’s neck, and drank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was intoxicating, the taste of his blood, the thrill of power that moved through her as she subdued his struggles with her superior strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 32\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRhys didn’t have to wait long to discover Villagrande’s intentions. He had spent the evening with Megan, kissed her good night, and tucked her into bed a little after 1 A.M. He was outside, taking a turn around the house, when his cell phone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Costain? It’s Nicholas. Winchester has been destroyed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Winchester wanted to watch the football game tonight, so the two of us went to his place. We were playing poker later when Villagrande showed up. He destroyed Winchester before I realized what was happening.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why not you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He needed a messenger boy. He told me to tell you he’s taking over the West Coast. He said you can either swear allegiance to him or he’s going to destroy the rest of us, one by one. And then you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s the rest of the Council?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here, at the meeting house. We’re all here. What are you going to do about Villagrande?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wish I knew.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“None of us are strong enough to take him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. Have you told the others what happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not yet. I called you first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you do with the body?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I left it where it was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, I’ll take care of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you want me to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stay there until you hear from me. No one’s to leave the house, understood?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And don’t say anything until I get there.” Muttering an oath, Rhys ended the call. He lingered on the porch for several minutes, his brow furrowed. He needed to dispose of Winchester’s body, and then he should probably meet with the Council members and let them know what was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit!” Rhys dragged a hand through his hair. He had to decide what he was going to do. Villagrande had laid down an unmistakable challenge, and it was up to Rhys to answer it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, what’s it gonna be?” he muttered. “Stay and fight? Or tuck your tail between your legs and run like a damn dog?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grunted softly. Why hadn’t he thought of it before? There was a third option, and one he might have to use if things got any worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 33\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik Delacourt frowned when his cell phone rang. When he read the time, he knew it couldn’t be good news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaisy looked up from the book she was reading, a question in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s Rhys.” Erik mouthed the words before he answered the phone. “What’s wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m having a little trouble with Villagrande,” Rhys said. “I could use some backup from someone I can trust.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Villagrande!” Erik exclaimed. “What’s going on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s after the West Coast.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik uttered a short, pithy curse. “What makes you think that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He said so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The killings across the country?” Erik asked. “Were they…?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. You’re lucky he didn’t get hungry in Boston. He made his way here one body at a time. Earlier tonight, he killed a Council member.” Rhys didn’t mention Adrianna. That feud had been between her and Villagrande, and Villagrande had the right to settle it as he saw fit, even if Rhys disagreed with his methods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik swore again. “What do you want me to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right now I’m only concerned about one thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And that would be?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A woman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik stared at the phone, wondering if he’d heard right. “A woman? You mean, a mortal woman?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is she in danger?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know, but I don’t want to take any chances.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She means a lot to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t a question. And Rhys didn’t answer. “I was wondering if you’d come and work some of your black magick on her house. I’m not sure a threshold, even one I’ve warded, is strong enough to keep Villagrande out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you think it’ll come to a fight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I sure as hell hope not. I don’t think I could take him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll be there first thing tomorrow night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks. I’ll owe you one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right,” Erik said, chuckling. “Let’s just hope you’re around to pay up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was that all about?” Daisy asked after he ended the call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you remember Tomás Villagrande?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How could I forget him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik grunted softly. Not so long ago, Villagrande had kidnapped Daisy’s father and brother. He remembered it as if it had happened yesterday. He had tracked Daisy’s father and brother to Villagrande’s yacht….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoing below, Erik followed the vampire’s scent into a stateroom where he found the two O’Donnell men lying on the floor, bound and apparently under some kind of preternatural enchantment. He was moving toward them when he realized he was no longer alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik whirled around, fangs extended, and came face-to-face with one of his kind. Clad in a pair of black trousers and a loose-fitting white shirt, the vampire was tall and lean and looked to be in his late twenties, though his aura was much older.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing here?” the vampire asked. His voice was mild, though his eyes blazed red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know these two,” Erik said, gesturing at Daisy’s father and brother. “They’re not to be harmed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other vampire lifted one brow. “Indeed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They violated my lair. They tried to destroy me. I am within my rights to do with them as it pleases me. And it pleases me to kill them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m afraid I can’t allow you to do that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No? Who are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Erik Delacourt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know me?” Erik asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have heard of you. It is said you are a close friend of Costain’s.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik nodded, wondering if that was good or bad. “Who the hell are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tomás Villagrande.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik swore under his breath. Villagrande was the Master of the East Coast Vampires, and was even older than Rhys. It was rumored among the ranks of the Undead that Villagrande had been one of the first of their kind, that it was Villagrande who had bequeathed the Dark Gift to Dracula himself. Erik didn’t know if that was true, but Villagrande’s preternatural power was unmistakable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVillagrande folded his arms over his chest. “Why do you care if these two live or die?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re related to someone I hold dear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That does change things, does it not?” Villagrande mused aloud. “And yet the fact remains that they are mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTension thrummed through Erik as he summoned his power. If the other vampire wanted a fight, so be it, although pitting his strength against that of a much older vampire seemed like suicide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This someone you hold dear, is it a woman?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah. And is she young and beautiful beyond compare?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik nodded even as he wondered what game Villagrande was playing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are in love with her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An overrated emotion to be sure,” Villagrande remarked, his voice melancholy. “Yet I confess that I, too, have been caught in that snare from time to time. Tell me, are you willing to challenge me in combat to save these two?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik swore inwardly. He had hoped it wouldn’t come to that, but he couldn’t go back to Daisy and tell her he had failed. Better not to return at all. “If I have to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVillagrande stroked his chin as he contemplated Erik’s decision. “She means that much to you, this woman?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVillagrande laughed softly. “I do not wish to kill you. You have trouble enough. Take them and go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just like that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just like that.” Villagrande smiled, showing a hint of fang. “Never let it be said that Tomás Villagrande stood in the way of true love. As for your inept friends here, I am surprised they have survived as long as they have. They should wake in half an hour or so. You might tell them to be more careful in the future,” he said, and with a wave of his hand, he vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, what did Rhys have to say?” Daisy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It seems Villagrande is planning a takeover of the West Coast,” Erik replied, and quickly relayed what Rhys had told him over the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was that about a woman?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think our Mr. Costain has fallen in love,” Erik said with a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No way!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErik nodded. “I think he’s in love big-time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, we’re going to California?” Daisy remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Looks that way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t wait. I’m anxious to meet the woman who finally captured his heart. And maybe,” she said, her eyes twinkling, “we’ll even find time for a midnight stroll on the beach.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everlasting-desire-everlasting-2/page-33.html","bookId":2304,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:10:49 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:10:49 PM"}
