Luther and Nora slept until almost 7 A.M., when the phone awakened them. \"May I speak to Frosty?\" came the voice of a teenager, and before Luther could shoot back a retort the line was dead. He managed to laugh though, and as he jumped out of bed he patted his rather firm stomach and said, \"The islands are calling us, dear. Let\u0027s pack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fetch my coffee,\" she said and slid deeper under the covers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe morning was overcast and cold, the chance of a white Christmas fifty-fifty. Luther certainly didn\u0027t want one. Nora would lapse into a spell of nostalgia if snow fell on Christmas Eve. She\u0027d grown up in Connecticut, where, according to her, every Christmas had been white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther didn\u0027t want the weather meddling with their flight tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood at the front window, exactly where the tree would\u0027ve been, sipped his coffee, gazed upon his lawn to make sure it had not been vandalized by Spike Frohmeyer and his band of outlaws, and looked at the Scheel home across the street. In spite of all its lights and decorations, it was a gloomy place. Walt and Bev were in there, having their coffee, sleepwalking through the motions, both knowing but not saying that this could be their last Christmas together. For a moment Luther felt a twinge of regret about eliminating Christmas, but it didn\u0027t last long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext door, things were certainly different at the Trogdons\u0027. They followed the odd custom of playing Santa Claus on the morning of Christmas Eve, twenty-four hours before the rest of the world, then loading their mini-van and racing off to a lodge for a week of skiing. Same lodge every year, and Trogdon had explained that they had Christmas dinner in a stone cabin before a roaring fireplace with thirty other Trogdons. Very cozy, great skiing, kids loved it, and the family got along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDifferent strokes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the Trogdons were already up and unwrapping piles of gifts. Luther could see movement around their tree, and he knew that before long they\u0027d be hauling boxes and bags to the van, then the yelling would start. The Trogdon kids would be whisked away before they were forced to explain, how, exactly, they got such a favorable deal from Santa Claus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtherwise, Hemlock was still and quiet, bracing itself for the festivities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther took another sip and grinned smugly at the world. On the morning of a typical Christmas Eve, Nora would bounce out of bed at sunrise with two long lists, one for her, an even longer one for him. By seven, she\u0027d have a turkey in the oven, the house spotless, the tables set for the party, and her thoroughly defeated husband out in the jungle trying to beat last-minute traffic with his list. They\u0027d bark at each other, face to face and by cell phone. He\u0027d forget something and be sent back into the streets. He\u0027d break something and the world would come to an end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTotal chaos. Then, around six, when they were both exhausted and sick off the holidays, their guests would arrive. Their guests would also be dog-tired from the frenzied ordeal of Christmas, but they would push on and make the best of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Krank Christmas party had begun years earlier with a dozen or so friends over for appetizers and drinks, Last year, they\u0027d fed fifty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smug smile spread even wider across his face. He relished the solitude of his home and the prospect of a day with nothing to do but throw a few clothes in a suitcase and get ready for the beaches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey enjoyed a late breakfast of tasteless bran cereal and yogurt. Conversation over the Gazette was soft and pleasant. Nora was trying gamely to ignore the memories of past Christmases. She worked hard at being excited about their trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think she\u0027s safe?\" she finally asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s fine,\" Luther said without looking up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stood at the front window and talked about the Scheels, and they watched the Trogdons move about. Traffic picked up on Hemlock as folks ventured out for one last foray into the madness. A delivery truck stopped in front of their house. Butch the deliveryman bounded out of it with a box. He ran to the front door just as Luther was opening it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Merry Christmas,\" he said tersely, and practically threw the package at Luther. A week earlier, during a less-stressful delivery, Butch had lingered a bit, waiting for his annual gratuity. Luther had explained that they were not celebrating Christmas this year. See, we have no tree, Butch. No decorations. No gifts. No lights on the shrubs, no Frosty on the roof. Just dropping out this year, Butch. No calendars from the police, no fruitcakes from the firemen. Nothing, Butch. Butch left with nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe box was from a mail-order outfit called Boca Beach. Luther\u0027d found them on the Internet. He took the package to the bedroom, locked the door, and put on a matching shirt and shorts outfit that in print had looked just a little offbeat, but now, hanging on Luther, looked downright gaudy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it, Luther?\" Nora said, banging on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a yellow, aqua, and teal print of marine life-large fat fishes with bubbles floating up from their mouths. Whimsical, yes. Silly, yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Luther decided right there on the spot that he would love it and wear it proudly around one of the pools on the Island Princess. He yanked open the door. Nora covered her mouth and was instantly hysterical. He paraded down the hall, wife behind him in stitches, his brown feet and toes a sharp contrast to the khaki carpet, and he marched into the living room where he stood proudly at the front window for all of Hemlock to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not going to wear that!\" Nora roared from behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I certainly am!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027m not going!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s hideous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re just jealous because you don\u0027t have this outfit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thrilled that I don\u0027t have it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed her and they danced around the room, both laughing, Nora to the point of having tears in her eyes. Her husband, an uptight tax accountant with a stodgy outfit like Wiley Beck, trying his best to dress like a beach bum. And missing badly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Luther would remember after, he and Nora stopped their dancing and laughing on the second ring, maybe the third, and for some reason paused and stared at the phone. It rang again, and he walked a few steps to get it. Things were deathly still and quiet; as he recalled later, everything seemed to be in slow motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello,\" he said. For some reason, the receiver felt heavier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Daddy, it\u0027s me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was surprised, then he was not. Surprised to hear Blair\u0027s voice, but then not surprised at all that she had schemed some way to get to a phone to call her parents and wish them a Merry Christmas. They had phones in Peru, after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut her words were so crisp and clear. Luther had trouble picturing his beloved daughter on a stump in the jungle yelling into some portable satellite phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blair,\" he said. Nora bolted to his side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next word that registered with Luther was the word \"Miami.\" There were words before it and some after, but that one stuck. Just seconds into the conversation Luther was treading water and about to sink. Things were swirling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you, dear?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few words, then that \"Miami\" word again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re in Miami?\" Luther said, his voice high and dry. Nora shuffled quickly so that her eyes, wild and harsh, were just inches from his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he listened. Then he repeated, \"You\u0027re in Miami, conning home for Christmas. How wonderful, Blair!\" Nora\u0027s jaws unlocked, her mouth fell open as wide as Luther had ever seen it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore listening, then \"Who? Enrique?\" Then at full volume, Luther said, \"Your fiance! But what fiance?!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNora somehow managed to think, and she pushed the Speaker button on the phone. Blair\u0027s words poured forward and echoed around the living room; \"He\u0027s a Peruvian doctor I met right after I got here, and he\u0027s just so wonderful. We fell in love at first sight and within a week decided to get married. He\u0027s never been to the States and he\u0027s so excited. I\u0027ve told him all about Christmas there-the tree, the decorations, Frosty up on the roof, the Christmas party, everything. Is it snowing, Daddy? Enrique has never seen a white Christmas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, honey, not yet. Here\u0027s your mother.\" Luther handed the receiver to Nora, who took it, though with the Speaker button down it wasn\u0027t needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blair, where are you, dear?\" Nora asked, doing a good job of sounding enthused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the Miami airport, Mom, and our flight gets home at six-oh-three. Mom, you\u0027re gonna love Enrique, he\u0027s the sweetest thing, and drop-dead gorgeous, too. We\u0027re crazy in love with each other. We\u0027ll talk about the wedding, probably do it next summer, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, well see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther had fallen onto the sofa, apparently stricken with a life-threatening ailment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlair gushed on: \"I\u0027ve told him all about Christmas on Hemlock, the kids, the Frostys, the big party at our house. You\u0027re doing the party, aren\u0027t you, Mom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther, near death, groaned, and Nora made her first mistake. In the panic of the moment she could not be blamed for muddled thinking. What she should\u0027ve said, what she wished she\u0027d said, what Luther later, with perfect hindsight, claimed she should\u0027ve said, was \"Well, no, honey, we\u0027re not doing the party this year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut nothing was clear right then, and Nora said, \"Of course we are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther groaned again. Nora looked at him, the fallen beach bum in his ridiculous costume, lying over there like he\u0027d been shot. She\u0027d certainly shoot him if given half a chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh great! Enrique has always wanted to see Christmas in the States. I\u0027ve told him all about it. Isn\u0027t this a wonderful surprise, Mom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, honey, I\u0027m so thrilled,\" Nora managed to get out with just enough conviction. \"We\u0027ll have a grand time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom, no gifts, okay. Please promise me no gifts. I wanted to surprise you by coming home, but I don\u0027t want you and Daddy running around right now buying a bunch of gifts. Promise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great. I can\u0027t wait to get home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ve been gone only a month, Luther wanted to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure this is okay, Mom?\" As if Luther and Nora had a choice. As if they could say, \"No, Blair, you can\u0027t come home for Christmas. Turn around, dear, and go back to the jungles of Peru.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I gotta run. We fly from here to Atlanta, then home. Can you meet us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, dear,\" Nora said. \"No problem. And you say he\u0027s a doctor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Mother, and he\u0027s so wonderful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther sat on the edge of the sofa with his face stuck in his palms and appeared to be crying. Nora stood with the phone clutched in her hand and her hands on her hips, staring at the man on the sofa and debating whether or not to hurl it at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst her better judgment, she decided not to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his palms just wide enough to say, \"What time is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s eleven-fifteen, December twenty-fourth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was frozen for a long time before Luther said, \"Why did you tell her we were having the party?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because we\u0027re having the party.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know who\u0027s coming or what they\u0027re going to eat when they get here, but we\u0027re having a party.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t start, Luther. This was your stupid idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t think it was stupid yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well today you\u0027re an idiot. We\u0027re having the party, Mr. Beach Bum, and we\u0027re putting up a tree, with lights and decorations, and you\u0027re going to get your little brown butt up on the roof and do Frosty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother long pause and Luther could hear a clock ticking loudly somewhere in the kitchen. Or perhaps it was the steady pounding of his heart His shorts caught his attention. Just minutes earlier bed put them on in anticipation of a magical trip to paradise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNora put the phone down and went to the kitchen, where drawers were soon being slammed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuther continued staring at his colorful shorts. Now they made him ill. Gone were the cruise, the beaches, the islands, the warm waters, and the nonstop food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could one phone call change so much? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/skipping-christmas/page-12.html","bookId":2639,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:05 PM"}
