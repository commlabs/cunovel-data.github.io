I’m sorry. Nan started threatening to off herself and I panicked. I was in big brother mode.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was always in big brother mode with Nan. Coming here I knew I was in for a lot of Nan but it was harder than I’d imagined. Especially after the way she’d treated me last night. I didn’t believe for a minute that she’d kill herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s manipulating you. I hate to see her do that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush stood up and ran his hand through his hair and walked over to the window. He didn’t agree with me. I could tell by the stiff way he was holding his shoulders. He looked defensive. “She’s upset and hurt. I know she’s been a bitch to you in the past but right now I need you. For me, could you not say hurtful things to her? I’m really worried about her mental stability at the moment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurtful things? I hadn’t said anything to Nan. Did he think I was going to? “I was the one who said we should come. I understand she needs your help. Why would you think that I would say hurtful things to her?” I asked, standing up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush let his head fall back and he closed his eyes tightly like he really didn’t want to be having this conversation. Something was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know what you said to her last night at the table. She told me. And yeah, you have every right to say those things to her but right now I just need you not to. The sooner I can fix this the sooner we head back to Rosemary and leave this nightmare.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did I say to her last night at the table? I’m not following you,” I replied feeling a sick knot in my stomach. Was Nan lying about me? She was the one who had said hurtful things at the table. Not me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She feels like you made fun of her. Just ... it’s probably best if you just don’t talk to her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat back down on the bed and let last night’s conversations run through my head. How did she feel like I’d made fun of her? She’d attacked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA soft knock on the door interrupted what I was about to say and Rush let out a frustrated growl before stalking over to open it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry. I don’t want to disturb y’all but Nan is demanding to know what room is Daddy’s. She doesn’t need to wake him up. That would be bad,” Harlow’s soft-spoken voice sounded anxious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit,” Rush muttered. He glanced back at me. “I’m sorry. I’ll be back in a few minutes. Just go back to bed and get some rest. I won’t let anyone else disturb you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the door was closed I let the tears fall. When I’d told him to come deal with Nan I’d thought this would be easier. I had hoped after her accident and her comment about being a part of the baby’s life that she’d be more manageable. I was wrong. Coming here had been a bad idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach cramped and I froze. I sat still and waited on the baby to kick and reassure me everything was okay. Nothing happened. I put both my hands on my stomach and the cramp came again. Wincing I tried to calm my heart as it started to race. Something was wrong. A wave of nausea hit me and I laid back and closed my eyes. Maybe I’d gotten up too quick this morning. I needed to start being more careful. All the high-strung tension in this house was getting to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes and took slow deep breaths. No more cramps came and I felt a soft kick against my hand. With that little bit of reassurance I drifted off to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I opened my eyes the sun had moved and was shinning brightly through the windows. It had to be after lunch. I reached for my phone and checked the time. It was one. I must have been more tired than I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled over to get up and a tray of food was sitting on a small table beside the bed. I wrapped the sheet around me and went over to it. I smiled as I picked up the small note with Rush’s familiar scrawl on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m sorry about this morning. You were exhausted and I unloaded on you. None of this is your fault. I just want to get it all over with and get you back home. Eat something. I’m going to go see if I can talk to Kiro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI love you more than life,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked up the silver cover that had been protecting my plate to find fresh strawberries and cream, salmon, and a slice of toast. My stomach still wasn’t feeling that great so I decided to stay away from the salmon but I took a strawberry and dipped it into the cream before taking a bite. The sweet taste hit my tongue and I felt better. Sitting on the edge of the bed, I finished all the strawberries and toast before getting up and going to get a shower. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forever-too-far-too-far-3/page-18.html","bookId":1995,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:37 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:37 AM"}
