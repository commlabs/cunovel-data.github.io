I sneakily reached out and held her small delicate cold hand. I was addicted to the feeling of her tenderness and bonelessness as I held her hand. This was heaven**. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Zi raised her head and looked at me before sighing. She took back her hand. I was curious. ‘\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhat’s happening to her? She seems to be unhappy. Didn’t I clarify with her already? Why is she like this? Can it still be because of Hai Shui?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e’\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI whispered, “Mu Zi, what’s wrong?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShe gently shook her head. “Nothing. It’s just that you didn’t write me a love letter. In fact, it’s been a few days since you wrote me one.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI blankly replied, “\u003c/span\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eOh\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e! I’ll write one now.” As I said that, I took out a piece of paper and wrote the love letter.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mu Zi, we have been apart for a few days. I thought about you constantly. I don’t know why, but I felt empty when I didn’t see you those days. You’ve been asking me what I was doing during these few days. I’ll tell you now, as I know we shouldn’t have secrets between us. I took the two days leave to participate in the secret battle between Prince Ke Zha and Duke Te Yi. You should know the outcome already. Prince Ke Zha won the final victory in the competition. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt doesn’t matter if you believe this or not, but I didn’t participate in the battle for riches and honour. It was for the future fate of the Kingdom of Aixia and the numerous commoners. I feel that the worst situation for this matter would be a civil war. A war is only beneficial to those that want power, but the ones that will suffer are the commoners. I detest wars. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe fighting was settled using a best out of five matches competition. I participated in the fourth round.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eYou might be curious about why I was able to represent the prince in battle, so I’ll tell you another secret. I’m the eleventh Magister in the world. Do you think I am compatible for you now?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMy opponent was the Ri family’s leader, Si Feng Ri. He’s Feng Liang’s grandfather. It was the most tenacious battle that I had experienced. His power can no longer be gauged by using the standard level of a magician. While I was forced to face death by him, the one that appeared in my heart was you. At that time I thought that, if I survived this ordeal and saw you again, I’d definitely treat you well and never let you go. I want to tell you how I honestly feel for you in my heart. I love you. I really love you. There is only you in my heart.” (Writing until this point, I got emotional. My love for Mu Zi roared out like the sea. A drop of my tears landed on the paper.) \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI stopped and controlled my emotions before continuing to write.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I don’t know why, but it’s like there’s a barrier between us. It’s some sort of wall. I’m unable to break through that solid wall. It makes it impossible to know how you really feel for me. Can you just tell me? I really want to hear your thoughts. I won’t force you to tell me, as everyone should have their secrets. You have your own space. It’s because I love you, so I don’t want to force you to express your feelings for me.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen you agreed to be my temporary girlfriend, I was jubilant. However, after that I realized that it wasn’t because you love me, but were instead just interested in me. I didn’t feel anything about that at that moment, but now my heart feels uneasy thinking about it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf you are worrying about the matter regarding Hai Shui, you don’t need to, as I have always treated her like she is my own sister. There’s no one that can enter my heart, except for you. I don’t know when you will open up your heart to me. I also don’t know if you like me at all, but my heart is yours. This is an indisputable fact.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Zi, could you please accept me?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eInscribed with forever loving you, Zhang Gong.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMy emotions undulated, just like in the letter. I held the letter and stared at it; not knowing if Mu Zi would accept it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhen I looked at Mu Zi, she was looking at me. I didn’t know that the tear on the letter had greatly moved the girl beside me.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Zi took the letter from my hand and read it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI didn’t dare to see her. I was afraid that she would reject me. It wasn’t the same as the previous love letters. This time, I had put my heart into writing it. If I couldn’t replace my heart, I didn’t know if I could accept her rejection. I lowered my head and waited, as though I was a prisoner that was facing life or death judgement. I was really nervous while I waited.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAfter an extremely long time, an ice-cold, tender hand held my sweaty hand due to being nervous. I raised my head and saw that Mu Zi was looking at me. This was the first time that I had seen so much emotion coming from her eyes.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI anxiously whispered, “Do you accept me?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Zi lip curved up, showing happiness and lightly nodded her head. “Silly guy!” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI felt that my world had completely changed instantly. My surroundings were filled with colours. I tightly held onto her hand and mumbled, “Is this for real? Is it?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Zi face reddened and whispered. “We’re still in the classroom, so restrain yourself a little.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI nodded strongly and placed a kiss onto Mu Zi’s hand that I was holding. Mu Zi’s face reddened and looked like a red apple. She exclaimed, “What are you doing? I just told you to restrain yourself, but you….”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI replied, “I’m sorry, but I...I was just too excited.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Zi’s mood dampened a little, “I don’t know if I made the right choice. Are we really going to be able to stay together forever?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI firmly nodded and tightly held onto the little sweaty delicate hand of Mu Zi. “Yes, we can! I don’t know what the future holds and I’ll probably experience difficulties and troubles, but I’ll always hold you tightly and protect you forever.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Zi smiled with abnormal brilliance. She held back my hand and said. “You’ve got to remember what you said today!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI dazily said, “Mu Zi, your smile is so beautiful.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Zi replied, “How is it beautiful? You’re hateful. I don’t really know which part of me that made you love me.” \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eI blurted out, “I love every part of you!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMu Zi glanced at me, but her expression was filled with happiness. “I have a lot of things that I still can’t tell you. You’ll find out about it in the future. I really hope that we can conquer all of our problems.” She sighed and said, “Actually, Hai Shui is more suited to you than me. She’s more beautiful and her family background is also exceptional. I can clearly see that she really likes you. Why don’t you try and accept her instead?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/child-of-light/col-volume-4-chapter-37\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/child-of-light/col-volume-4-chapter-39\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/child-of-light/col-volume-4-chapter-38","bookId":1498,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:31:03 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:31:03 AM"}
