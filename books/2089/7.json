I was on my feet, rifle in one hand, the other on the door, when I realized the sound had stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI listened, straining my ears, trying to determine a direction, but all I heard was the wail of a sax from the bar downstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy shirt was wet with sweat. My heart thudded in my throat. My skin was covered with gooseflesh. It still took me several moments to understand that I was the one who had been screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set the gun next to the door. My hand shook and I clenched it until my fingers ached. I went to the sink, shoved my head under the water, drank directly from the faucet, then ran the cool liquid over the pulsing veins in my wrists. Slowly my heartbeat returned to normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Edward could see me now, I\u0027d be in deep trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of my history, I was required to visit a specially trained J-S psychiatrist four times a year. This merely meant I\u0027d learned exactly what to say to be declared fit for duty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e/ understand that killing the werewolves won\u0027t bring back my family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, I\u0027m not searching for the white wolf on my own time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The dreams are gone,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe empty room, which still rang with the echoes of my screams, mocked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t had a dream in a very long time. Sleeping in the daylight had taken care of the nightmares. But they were still there waiting for me to slip up. Just like the werewolves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head lifted. Droplets of water flew in every direction. I was dizzy. Breathless. Weak. I knew how to make that all go away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood. Theirs. Now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly hours before, I\u0027d decided not to hunt, but that had been before the dream. I no longer had a choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScooping up my rifle, I headed out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy watch said it was close to 4:00 a.m. I didn\u0027t have too much time before dawn. What I had would be enough. It would have to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I reached the bottom of the steps I frowned. All the cars were still in the lot. The saxophone continued to wail. The lights remained on inside. Hadn\u0027t they ever heard of bar time around here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe windows had been closed against the October night. I couldn\u0027t blame them. This far north, the first frost could arrive at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe glass was foggy. From age or a buildup of smoke, either way, I couldn\u0027t see anything inside but shadows. None of which moved. But then no one had been moving earlier, either, unless you counted the lifting of glasses to their mouths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dismissed the mystery of the bar patrons. I had better things to worry about. I could ask Jessie about the rules of bar time. If I actually cared. Or complain to Damien, though I\u0027d rather avoid him as much as possible. I didn\u0027t need any more complications in my life - and Damien Fitzgerald had complication written all over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI practically ran into the woods, crashed loudly through the brush. I wasn\u0027t trying to be covert. Drenched in nervous sweat how many times over, I must have smelled like a wild animal. My hair, despite the dousing in the sink, stood up in grainy, stiff hanks. I didn\u0027t mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted them to hear me, smell me, come after me. I didn\u0027t have all night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on!\" I shouted as I picked up my pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward had taught me to hunt from the trees as often as possible. Even when you found their lair, being up in a tree to take them out was preferable to being on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWolves were quick; werewolves were slippery and sly. Wolf body, person brain, deadly combination. A tall tree was the safest place. Though these wolves were special, they couldn\u0027t fly - yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut sometimes an opportunity presented itself and there was no convenient tree stand nearby. If Edward ever found out just how many times I broke the rules in order to kill the monsters, he would revoke my hunting rights for more than a day. He\u0027d lock me up in a white room. Again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked up my pace, needing to get farther into the forest, farther from Damien and his incredible nose. I planned on having another bonfire before daylight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d been in decent shape before I became a Jager-Sucher,\u0026nbsp; but once I signed on I learned how out of shape I was. Wolves would catch me if I ran. They can reach speeds of up to 40 miles per hour and cover 125 miles in a day, though 40 is average. Wolves can follow a herd at a run for 5 or 6 miles and then accelerate. Werewolves don\u0027t need supernatural abilities when just being wolves makes them superhuman. Which was why I always carried a gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s just one of me!\" I shouted. \"I\u0027m out here all alone. Come and get it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe J-S rule book said we needed to be sure we were shooting a werewolf. One way to do this, the preferred way, was to watch the beast change. However, Edward had taught me a few other less certain but no less acceptable ways, to be sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReal wolves would run from a human. Only werewolves ran toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth wolves and werewolves culled the weakest from the herd. Only werewolves attacked the strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly animals with human intelligence did so with military precision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rasp of my breath, the stomp of my boots, the crackle of branches nearly drowned out the whisper of the wind through the trees, the buzz of any remaining mosquitoes, the rustle of night creatures in the underbrush. Because of that I didn\u0027t hear the silence. Not at first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time I noticed how still everything had gotten - eerily so - it was too late. They were coming in fast from every direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Standard attack formation,\" I muttered. \"God, you\u0027re predictable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy rifle had been modified from semi- to fully automatic by the geniuses of the Jdger-Sucher weapons division. The gun appeared normal, but it wasn\u0027t. One of the reasons I preferred it to the standard-issue DNR shotgun - a nice piece of hardware but not for supernatural baddies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe automatic was completely illegal, of course, so arrest me. I didn\u0027t think the werewolves were going to call foul because I possessed the gun of a modern terrorist. When I got through with them they wouldn\u0027t be able to do anything but burn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first one burst from the foliage to my right. They were rarely able to wait. To stalk. To attack simultaneously. Someone always got eager, and then he was mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited until I saw the whites of their eyes. That they had whites was the reason I shot them. Look at a human\u0027s eyes, then look at a wolf\u0027s. You\u0027ll see what I mean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot a gray wolf in the chest. Then the one next to that, and the one next to that. I put my back to those bodies and mowed the rest down in a sweeping semicircle of gunfire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWerewolves are good at making a plan, what they can\u0027t seem to do is improvise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last wolf hit the ground and silence returned to the forest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Automatic weapon, sweep pattern. Screws \u0027em every time,\" I murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart still pounded fast and loud, but my hands had stopped shaking. I no longer felt weak. I no longer heard the voices in my head or the screaming in my ears. Life was good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI counted bodies. Eight. Not bad for a night\u0027s work. Damn good for an hour\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned down, planning to drag them into a pile - the easier to burn them, my dear - and a low, furious growl rumbled from behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spun around, bringing the gun up at the same time. I never set my gun down. Never.\u0026nbsp; Stuff like this had happened to me before. What had not happened was the click that signified empty when I pulled the trigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf, a russet monster with big brown eyes, grinned. He\u0027d flanked me. Bastard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Smarter than your pals, hey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lip lifted, turning the grin into a snarl. I shifted, bending my arms and pulling the gun back like a Louisville Slugger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Play ball.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe charged. I swung. The gun caught him in the head, but not hard enough. He hit me in the chest and followed me to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward had taught me a million things. The first, and by far the most useful at this moment, was how to grab a werewolf and keep him from eating your face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got one hand on the wolf\u0027s windpipe, the other around his muzzle, and held on. So far, so good. But how long could I hold him off?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaws flailed, claws digging for purchase. I didn\u0027t worry about getting scratched. Lycanthropy is a virus of sorts. Like rabies, it\u0027s passed through the saliva. So a scratch wouldn\u0027t make me furry, but it would hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, if those teeth so much as pricked my skin, I\u0027d be eating my associates raw within a day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath and tried to shove the werewolf away. I got nowhere. The animal was stronger than me. I was doomed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rustle, a snarl, then another furry body hurtled through the night. I tensed, expecting a second attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, the newcomer hit the wolf straddling my chest broadside, and they tumbled end over end away from me in a flurry of teeth, claws, and tails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t waste any time scrambling to my feet, retrieving my gun, and loading it as the huge red wolf and the smaller brown one fought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never seen wolves fight, except on TV. Never seen werewolves fight at all. I was glad I\u0027d missed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe combination of animal body and human ruthlessness was horrific to behold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey slashed and tore; blood dampened the ground; fur literally flew off them. I should have shot them both or at least run away. Instead, I could only stare, both repelled and fascinated by the savagery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe russet wolf was bigger, broader, stronger. But the brown one was pissed. He snarled the entire time, as if teasing the larger wolf, egging him on to more daring feats. They were both covered in blood - their own and each other\u0027s - when the smaller wolf broke away, limping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA real wolf would have let him go. The red werewolf charged. The other waited, waited, ducked as if giving in, then reached up and tore out the big bully\u0027s throat in one vicious yank. I had to admire his technique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe injured animal took a few steps, as if to run away, hide, maybe heal, but it was too late. He crumpled, dead before he hit the ground. The brown wolf walked over to his prize, not a hitch in his step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clever boy,\" I murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced up and cocked his head. Lifting my gun, I aimed right between his eyes. I couldn\u0027t see their color. The night was too dark, the moon too dim, the forest too thick. But they were human eyes. That much I could tell. That much was all I needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of Jimmy, my sister, brother, parents. I remembered other people the werewolves had killed, other places they had decimated. The hatred that lived inside of me - every day, every night - flared, and my finger tightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe animal continued to stare at me. He didn\u0027t try to run. I could swear he was begging me to do it. So I hesitated, thinking of what Cadotte had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if killing them is what they want?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf the werewolves wanted it, I knew I didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lowered my gun. The wolf snarled. His hackles lifted. Something was very wrong here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWerewolves craved human blood. They did not kill one another. So what was the matter with this one?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould he be something other than a werewolf? I\u0027d seen a lot as a Jager-Sucher.\u0026nbsp; Edward had seen even more. Every day, in amazing ways, new monsters came to life - one of the reasons Edward hunted less and stayed in the office more. The business he had started after World War Two kept growing and growing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the brown wolf and considered my options. A monster was a monster, wasn\u0027t it? Just because I killed werewolves didn\u0027t mean I couldn\u0027t kill something else. Call it a freebie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I couldn\u0027t bring myself to shoot the wolf. I\u0027m not sure why. The night\u0027s carnage didn\u0027t bother me. I\u0027d seen a helluva lot worse, been the cause of it, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn all honesty, the bullets and the blood were exhilarating. Chalk up nine for the good guys. Except only eight of them were mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hated to put an end to a perfect killing machine. Especially when he appeared to be on my side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" I said. \"Knock yourself out. Kill as many as you can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wolf did that canine head tilt again. Too bad his muzzle was red with blood. If I saw a dog like that, I\u0027d be creeped out. As it was... I was creeped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of waiting around until he ran off, then burning the wolves like I should have, I took my gun and headed back to the tavern more quickly than I\u0027d come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was against my nature to leave one of them alive, but as I told myself over and over as I waited for the sun to rise above the trees, I could always kill him later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-hunter-s-moon-nightcreature-2/page-7.html","bookId":2089,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:18 PM"}
