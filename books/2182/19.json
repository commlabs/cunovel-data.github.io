But there are details to sort out first. As anxious as I am to press on, I don\u0027t want to leave a job half-done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, with Timas leading the way, we sweep the compound in search of any survivors. I\u0027m not sure if I\u0027d take them captive or kill them, but there aren\u0027t any, so that\u0027s a question which ultimately doesn\u0027t require answering. Werewolves howl gratefully as I pass. Their previous leader never treated them to anything like this. They think it\u0027s going to be like this all the time, dozens of soldiers to feast on every day. I\u0027m sorry that I\u0027ll have to disappoint them. Maybe I can round up more of Antoine\u0027s collaborators and send them over-home delivery, Grubbs Grady style!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we\u0027re sure the compound\u0027s clean, Prae asks if I can move the werewolves out, so that she can reestablish the perimeter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything\u0027s changed,\" she sighs, running a hand through her grey hair. \"We can\u0027t take them back-I won\u0027t subject them to slavery and experimentation again, not after this-but we can\u0027t just leave them here. They\u0027d starve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m taking some with me,\" I tell her and all three of them stare at me. \"The attacks won\u0027t stop. Juni will send others against us. We\u0027ll have to fight again. And again. I\u0027d rather do that with my pack than without them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how will you control them?\" Meera asks. \"Off this island... in a city... you can\u0027t keep them like hounds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I can,\" I growl. \"I\u0027ll have to treat them to a kill every so often, but that shouldn\u0027t be a problem, not with the sort of action I\u0027m anticipating. I won\u0027t take them all, just the more advanced. Thirty, forty... no more than fifty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a good idea,\" Meera says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too bad,\" I grunt. \"Demons can\u0027t be killed by normal humans, but these have been tainted by the blood of the Demonata. They\u0027re creatures of magic. They can kill just about anything Lord Loss sends against us. So they\u0027re coming with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the rest?\" Prae asks before Meera can force an argument. \"Will you move them out of the compound, so that I can restore the wall? I\u0027ll remain here and order supplies, do what I can to make their lives as pleasant as possible. This will be my new mission, putting right some of the many things I did wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really think you can?\" I frown. \"Antoine wasn\u0027t working alone. The Lambs betrayed you. Are you sure you can make demands of them now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know most of those who sided with Antoine,\" Prae says, cheeks flushing with anger. \"I\u0027m sure I can expose the rest. I\u0027ll knock the Lambs back into shape. Remind everyone of our original mandate-to help those afflicted with the curse. We\u0027ll still search for a cure, but we won\u0027t breed or lie anymore. We won\u0027t even need to execute. We can offer an alternative now-this island.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A holiday resort for werewolves?\" I chuckle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePrae smiles. \"It sounds crazy, but why not? We couldn\u0027t do it before-they\u0027d have ripped each other to pieces. But they\u0027ve been altered. The modified creatures can control the others. We\u0027ll do the rest, feed them, guard them from the outside world, introduce new members into the fold as we reap them over the years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI like the idea of a werewolf sanctuary. \"OK. I\u0027ll give the order to retreat. You get to work on the walls. But Prae,\" I stop her as she turns. \"If you don\u0027t treat them right, I\u0027ll come back. Understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My daughter\u0027s one of them,\" Prae says tightly. \"I\u0027ll treat them right.\" Then she leaves, Timas in close attendance to help her with the computers, while I howl and direct my pack towards the exits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the werewolves depart, I scan them for the strongest and smartest. I grunt at those I like the look of and hold them back. They willingly group behind me. They don\u0027t know what I want, but they trust me and wait as patiently as they can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gather thirty-seven in total. Large, muscular, spectacularly ugly beasts. The weirdest personal army in history, but they won\u0027t let me down. We\u0027ll kill demons together, as many as Lord Loss and the Shadow pit against us. Bathe in their blood. Grow fat on their flesh. Sharpen our fangs on their bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy wolfen troops put Shark\u0027s dirty dozen to shame. I smile wryly when I think about the ex-soldier. He would have appreciated the final push, the slaughter and blood-drenched victory. He\u0027d have understood why I had to kill Horwitzer. Antoine was a worm who had to be squashed. Meera thinks I\u0027m a monster for ordering his death, but Shark would have done the same. So would Beranabus and Dervish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA year ago... hell, even a few hours ago, I wouldn\u0027t have. I was a child, with a naive sense of honour. Not anymore. We\u0027re fighting a war. The survival of the human race is at stake. Winning is all that matters. If we have to become kill-crazed beasts to defeat the demons, so be it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe don\u0027t have the luxury of guilt. Those of us who protect the world must place ourselves outside the morals of those we fight for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the last sated member of my pack crawls past, dragging a half-chewed leg, I give Prae and Timas the signal. They throw the relevant switches and the panels of the wall rumble back into place, sealing us off from the open spaces of Wolf Island. As the panels clang shut, my heart aches slightly. I want to be outside with the jubilant werewolves, running free. But I have obligations. My place lies away from this island.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" I growl at Meera and Timas. \"Let\u0027s lower the boats and get the hell out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you need help sorting out the Lambs, give me a call,\" Meera tells Prae. \"I\u0027ll do whatever I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\" Prae smiles weakly. \"I think I\u0027ll be able to handle matters myself, but I\u0027ll bear your offer in mind. Good luck with whatever you\u0027re heading off to do. I suspect our problems are minor compared to yours. I hope-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait!\" I snap, stopping near the edge of the cliff. A few of the boats were torn to pieces by the werewolves while we were waiting for Timas to open the doors of the compound, but most are intact and secured in place. One, however, has been lowered, and a rope ladder dangles next to where it stood. Creeping forward, I glance over the edge and spot a figure below, bobbing about in a boat. It\u0027s a man. He\u0027s lying on his back, as if soaking up the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way!\" I roar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is it?\" Meera shouts, but I don\u0027t stop to answer. Grabbing hold of the rope ladder, I throw myself from rung to rung. I\u0027m dimly aware of Timas and Meera scrabbling after me, but most of my thoughts are focused on the man in the boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I draw close to the last few rungs, I turn to study the figure. A dark mood descends. I\u0027m convinced I was mistaken, that I only saw what I wanted to see. Or if it\u0027s really him, that he\u0027s dead. But when he half-raises a hand to salute weakly, I know that he\u0027s real and alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shark!\" I yell, jumping into the boat and grinning with open joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look... weird,\" Shark wheezes, running a dubious eye over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\" I gasp. \"The cave... the werewolves...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" the ex-soldier scowls as Meera and Timas climb into the boat and stare at him like he\u0027s a ghost. \"You don\u0027t think I can... take care of a few werewolves... by myself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But...\" Meera shakes her head, smiling slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d have been in trouble if... you hadn\u0027t swept the rest of the pack away,\" Shark mutters, sitting up, leaning forward and wincing. \"But when I came out of the cave and found... the island deserted, it was simple to hobble over here and... lower a boat. I wanted to come and see what... was happening inside the compound, but that would\u0027ve... been pushing my luck. Besides, I thought you might need to make... a quick getaway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShark\u0027s bleeding all over. His left ear has been bitten off. I can only barely see his right eye- it\u0027s a miracle he didn\u0027t lose it, as most of the flesh around it has been clawed away. He\u0027s missing the tops of all four fingers on his left hand, and the thumb and half his index finger on the right. As he leans further forward, I see a jagged hole in his lower back. Timas sees it too and bends over for a closer look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some of your entrails are poking through,\" Timas says, reaching out to prod them back into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leave my guts alone,\" Shark growls, slapping the taller man\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a bloody wonder,\" I chuckle, then grab hold of the ladder. \"Patch him up,\" I tell Meera and Timas. \"I\u0027ll sort out extra boats for the werewolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Werewolves!\" Shark squints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re taking some with us. I\u0027m their leader now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t wait to hear about it,\" Shark says dryly. \"Just keep them well the hell... away from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re getting yellow in your old age,\" I grin, then shimmy up the ladder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last thing I hear, as I\u0027m climbing out of earshot, is Shark asking Timas and Meera, \"So, who\u0027s good with a needle and thread?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wolf-island-the-demonata-8/page-19.html","bookId":2182,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:33 PM"}
