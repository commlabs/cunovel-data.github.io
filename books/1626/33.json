The king peered at the cartouche on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027“Blessed is Queen Far-re-ptah”,\u0027 read Dil dutifully, “Ruler of the Skies, Lord of the Djel, Master of-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Grandma Pooney,\u0027 said the king. \u0027She\u0027ll do.\u0027 He looked at their startled faces. \u0027That\u0027s what I used to call her when I was a little boy. I couldn\u0027t pronounce Far-re-ptah, you see. Well, go on then. Stop gawking. Break the door down.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGern hefted the hammer uncertainly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s a pyramid, master,\u0027 he said, appealing to Dil. \u0027You\u0027re not supposed to open them.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What do you suggest, lad? We stick a tableknife in the slot and wiggle it about?\u0027 said the king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Do it, Gern,\u0027 said Dil. \u0027It will be all right.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGern shrugged, spat on his hands which were, in fact, quite damp enough with the sweat of terror, and swung.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Again,\u0027 said the king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe great slab boomed as the hammer hit it, but it was granite, and held. A few flakes of mortar floated down, and then the echoes came back, shunting back and forth along the dead avenues of the necropolis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Again.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGern\u0027s biceps moved like turtles in grease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time there was an answering boom, such as might be caused by a heavy lid crashing to the ground, far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stood in silence, listening to a slow shuffling noise from inside the pyramid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Shall I hit it again, sire?\u0027 said Gern. They both waved him into silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shuffling grew closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the stone moved. It stuck once or twice, but never the less it moved, slowly, pivoting on one side so that a crack of dark shadow appeared. Dil could just make out a darker shape in the blackness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes?\u0027 it said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s me, Grandma,\u0027 said the king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shadow stood motionless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What, young Pootle?\u0027 it said, suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe king avoided Dil\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That\u0027s right, Grandma. We\u0027ve come to let you out.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Who\u0027re these men?\u0027 said the shadow petulantly. \u0027I\u0027ve got nothing, young man,\u0027 she said to Gern. \u0027I don\u0027t keep any money in the pyramid and you can put that weapon away, it doesn\u0027t frighten me.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027They\u0027re servants, Grandma,\u0027 said the king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Have they got any identification?\u0027 muttered the old lady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027m identifying them, Grandma. We\u0027ve come to let you out.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I was hammering hours,\u0027 said the late queen, emerging into the sunlight. She looked exactly like the king, except that the mummy wrappings were greyer and dusty. \u0027I had to go and have a lie down, come the finish. No-one cares about you when you\u0027re dead. Where\u0027re we going?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027To let the others out,\u0027 said the king.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Damn good idea.\u0027 The old queen lurched into step behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027So this is the netherworld, is it?\u0027 she said. \u0027Not much of an improvement.\u0027 She elbowed Gern sharply. \u0027You dead too, young man?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No, ma\u0027am,\u0027 said Gern, in the shaky brave tones of someone on a tightrope over the chasms of madness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s not worth it. Be told.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes, ma\u0027am.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe king shuffled across the ancient pavings to the next pyramid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I know this one,\u0027 said the queen. \u0027It was here in my day. King Ashk-ur-men-tep. Third Empire. What\u0027s the hammer for, young man?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Please, ma\u0027am, I have to hammer on the door, ma\u0027am,\u0027 said Gern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You don\u0027t have to knock. He\u0027s always in.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027My assistant means to smash the seals, ma\u0027am,\u0027 said Dil, anxious to please.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Who\u0027re you?\u0027 the queen demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027My name is Dil, O queen. Master embalmer.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Oh, you are, are you? I\u0027ve got some stitching wants seeing to.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It will be an honour and a privilege, O queen,\u0027 said Dil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes. It will,\u0027 she said, and turned creakily to Gern. \u0027Hammer away, young man!\u0027 she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpurred by this, Gern brought the hammer round in a long, fast arc. It passed in front of Dil\u0027s nose making a noise like a partridge and smashed the seal into pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat emerged, when the dust had settled, was not dressed in the height of fashion. The bandages were brown and mouldering and, Dil noticed with professional concern, already beginning to go at the elbows. When it spoke, it was like the opening of ancient caskets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I woket up,\u0027 it said. \u0027And theyre was noe light. Is thys the netherworld?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It would appear not,\u0027 said the queen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Thys is all?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hardly worth the trouble of dying, was it?\u0027 said the queen. The ancient king nodded, but gently, as though he was afraid his head would fall off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Somethyng,\u0027 he said, \u0027must be done.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to look at the Great Pyramid, and pointed with what had once been an arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Who slepes there?\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s mine, actually,\u0027 said Teppicymon, lurching forward. \u0027I don\u0027t think we\u0027ve met, I haven\u0027t been interred as yet, my son built it for me. It was against my better judgement, believe me.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It ys a dretful thyng,\u0027 said the ancient king. \u0027I felt its building. Even in the sleep of deathe I felt it. It is big enough to interr the worlde.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I wanted to be buried at sea,\u0027 said Teppicymon. \u0027I hate pyramids.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You do not,\u0027 said Ashk-ur-men-tep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Excuse me, but I do,\u0027 said the king, politely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027But you do not. What you feel nowe is myld dislike. When you have lain in one for a thousand yeares,\u0027 said the ancient one, \u0027then you will begin to know the meaning of hate.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeppicymon shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The sea,\u0027 he said. \u0027That\u0027s the place. You just dissolve away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey set off towards the next pyramid. Gern led the way, his face a picture, possibly one painted late at night by an artist who got his inspiration on prescription. Dil followed. He held his chest high. He\u0027d always hoped to make his way in the world and here he was now, walking with kings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell. Lurching with kings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was another nice day in the high desert. It was always a nice day, if by nice you meant an air temperature like an oven and sand you could roast chestnuts on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou Bastard ran fast, mainly to keep his feet off the ground for as long as possible. For a moment as they staggered up the hills outside the olive-tree\u0027d, field-patchworked oasis around Ephebe, Teppic thought he saw the Unnamed as a tiny speck on the azure sea. But it might have been just a gleam on a wave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he was over the crest, into a world of yellow and umber. For a while scrubby trees held on against the sand, but the sand won and marched triumphantly onwards, dune after dune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe desert was not only hot, it was quiet. There were no birds, none of the susurration of organic creatures busily being alive. At night there might have been the whine of insects, but they were deep under the sand against the scorch of day, and the yellow sky and yellow sand became an anechoic chamber in which You Bastard\u0027s breath sounded like a steam-engine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeppic had learned many things since he first went forth from the Old Kingdom, and he was about to learn one more. All authorities agree that when crossing the scorching desert it is a good idea to wear a hat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou Bastard settled into the shambling trot that a prime racing camel can keep up for hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a couple of miles Teppic saw a column of dust behind the next dune. Eventually they came up behind the main body of the Ephebian army, swinging along around half-a-dozen battle elephants, their helmet plumes waving in the oven breeze. They cheered on general principles as Teppic went past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBattle elephants! Teppic groaned. Tsort went in for battle elephants, too. Battle elephants were the fashion lately. They weren\u0027t much good for anything except trampling on their own troops when they inevitably panicked, so the military minds on both sides had responded by breeding bigger elephants. Elephants were impressive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor some reason, many of these elephants were towing great carts full of timber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jogged onwards as the sun wound higher and, and this was unusual, blue and purple dots began to pinwheel gently across the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother strange thing was happening. The camel seemed to be trotting across the sky. Perhaps this had something to do with the ringing noise in his ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould he stop? But then the camel might fall off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was long past noon when You Bastard staggered into the baking shade of the limestone outcrop which had once marked the edge of the valley, and collapsed very slowly into the sand. Teppic rolled off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA detachment of Ephebians were staring across the narrow space towards a very similar number of Tsorteans on the other side. Occasionally, for the look of the thing, one of them waved a spear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Teppic opened his eyes it was to see the fearsome bronze masks of several Ephebian soldiers peering down at him. Their metal mouths were locked in sneers of terrible disdain. Their shining eyebrows were twisted in mortal anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of them said, \u0027He\u0027s coming round, sarge.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA metal face like the anger of the elements came closer, filling Teppic\u0027s vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027We\u0027ve been out without our hat, haven\u0027t we, sonny boy,\u0027 it said, in a cheery voice that echoed oddly inside the metal. \u0027In a hurry to get to grips with the enemy, were we?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sky wheeled around Teppic, but a thought bobbed into the frying pan of his mind, seized control of his vocal chords and croaked: \u0027The camel!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You ought to be put away, treating it like that,\u0027 said the sergeant, waggling a finger at him. \u0027Never seen one in such a state.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Don\u0027t let it have a drink!\u0027 Teppic sat bolt upright, great gongs clanging and hot, heavy fireworks going off inside his skull. The helmeted heads turned towards one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Gods, he must have something really terrible against camels,\u0027 said one of them. Teppic staggered upright and lurched across the sand to You Bastard, who was trying to work out the complex equation which would allow him to get to his feet. His tongue was hanging out, and he was not feeling well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA camel in distress isn\u0027t a shy creature. It doesn\u0027t hang around in bars, nursing a solitary drink. It doesn\u0027t phone up old friends and sob at them. It doesn\u0027t mope, or write long soulful poems about Life and how dreadful it is when seen from a bedsitter. It doesn\u0027t know what angst is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll a camel has got is a pair of industrial-strength lungs and a voice like a herd of donkeys being chainsawed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeppic advanced through the blaring. You Bastard reared his head and turned it this way and that, triangulating. His eyes rolled madly as he did the camel trick of apparently looking at Teppic with his nostrils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to spit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeppic grabbed his halter and pulled on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Come on, you bastard,\u0027 he said. \u0027There\u0027s water. You can smell it. All you have to do is work out how to get there!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to the assembled soldiers. They were staring at him with expressions of amazement, apart from those who hadn\u0027t removed their helmets and who were staring at him with expressions of metallic ferocity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeppic snatched a water skin from one of them, pulled out the stopper and tipped it on to the ground in front of the camel\u0027s twitching nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There\u0027s a river here,\u0027 he hissed. \u0027You know where it is, all you\u0027ve got to do is go there!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldiers looked around nervously. So did several Tsorteans, who had wandered up to see what was going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou Bastard got to his feet, knees trembling, and started to spin around in a circle. Teppic clung on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. . . let d equal 4, thought You Bastard desperately. Let a.d equal 90. Let not-d equal 45 . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I need a stick!\u0027 shouted Teppic, as he was whirled past the sergeant. \u0027They never understand anything unless you hit them with a stick, it\u0027s like punctuation to a camel!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Is a sword any good?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sergeant hesitated, and then passed Teppic his spear. He grabbed it point-end first, fought for balance, and then brought it smartly across the camel\u0027s flank, raising a cloud of dust and hair. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pyramids-discworld-7/page-33.html","bookId":1626,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:16:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:16:47 PM"}
