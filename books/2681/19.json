Flick asked herself Was Diana thinking of their schooldays, when Flick had always done so much better? Did that childhood rivalry still rankle? Greta was the only failure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again, she was more feminine than the real women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her hands over her ears, jumped nervously at every bang, and closed her eyes in terror as she pulled the trigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJim worked with her patiently, giving her earplugs to muffle the noise, holding her hand to teach her how to squeeze the trigger gently, but it was no good: she was too skittish ever to be a good shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just not cut out for this kind of thing!\" she said in despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJelly said, \"Then what the hell are you doing here?\" Flick interposed quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Greta\u0027s an engineer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s going to tell you where to place the charges.\" \"Why do we need a German engineer?\" \"I\u0027m English,\" Greta said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My father was born in Liverpool.\" Jelly snorted skeptically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If that\u0027s a Liverpool accent, I\u0027m the Duchess of Devonshire.\" \"Save your aggression for the next session,\" Flick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re about to do hand-to-hand combat.\" This bickering bothered her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe needed them to trust one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey returned to the garden of the house, where Bill Griffiths was waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had changed into shorts and tennis shoes, and was doing push-ups on the grass with his shirt off When he stood up, Flick got the feeling he wanted them to admire his physique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill liked to teach self-defense by giving the student a weapon and saying, \"Attack me.\" Then he would demonstrate how an unarmed man could repel an attacker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a dramatic and memorable lesson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill was sometimes unnecessarily violent but, Flick always thought, the agents might as well get used to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday he had a selection of weapons laid out on the old pine table: a wicked-looking knife that he claimed was SS equipment, a Walther P38 automatic pistol of the kind Flick had seen German officers carrying, a French policeman\u0027s truncheon, a length of black-and- yellow electrical cord that he called a garotte, and a beer bottle with the neck snapped to leave a rough circle of sharp glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his shirt back on for the training session.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How to escape from a man who is pointing a gun at you,\" he began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up the Waither, thumbed the safety catch up to the firing position, and handed the gun to Maude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pointed it at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sooner or later, your captor is going to want you to go somewhere.\" He turned and put his hands in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chances are, he\u0027ll follow close behind you, poking the gun in your back.\" He walked around in a wide circle, with Maude behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, Maude, I want you to pull the trigger the moment you think I\u0027m trying to escape.\" He quickened his pace slightly, forcing Maude to step out a little faster to keep up with him, and as she did so he moved sideways and back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe caught her right wrist under his arm and hit her hand with a sharp, downward-chopping motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cried out and dropped the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is where you can make a bad mistake,\" he said as Maude rubbed her wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not run away at this point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtherwise your Kraut copper will just pick up his gun and shoot you in the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat you have to do is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e.\" He picked up the Walther, pointed it at Maude, and pulled the trigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a bang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaude screamed, and so did Greta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This gun is loaded with blanks, of course,\" Bill said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes Flick wished Bill would not be quite so dramatic in his demonstrations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll practice all these techniques on one another in a few minutes,\" he went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up the electrical cord and turned to Greta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put that around my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I give the word, pull it as tight as you can.\" He handed her the cord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your Gestapo man, or your traitorous collaborationist French gendarme, could kill you with the cord, but he can\u0027t hold your weight with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll right, Greta, strangle me.\" Greta hesitated, then pulled the cord tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt dug into Bill\u0027s muscular neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kicked out forward with both feet and fell to the ground, landing on his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreta lost her grip on the cord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unfortunately,\" Bill said, \"this leaves you lying on the ground with your enemy standing over you, which is an unfavorable situation.\" He got up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll do it again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this time, before I drop to the ground, I\u0027m going to take hold of my captor by one wrist.\" They resumed the position, and Greta pulled the cord tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill grabbed her wrist, fell to the ground, pulling her forward and down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she fell on top of him, he bent one leg and kneed her viciously in the stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled off him and curled up, gasping for breath and retching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick said, \"For Christ\u0027s sake, Bill, that\u0027s a bit rough!\" He looked pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Gestapo are a lot worse than me,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went to Greta and helped her up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a bloody fucking Nazi,\" Greta gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick helped Greta into the house and sat her down in the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cook, who was peeling potatoes for lunch, offered her a cup of tea, and Greta accepted gratefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Flick returned to the garden, Bill had picked his next victim, Ruby, and handed her the policeman\u0027s truncheon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a cunning look on Ruby\u0027s face, and Flick thought: If I were Bill I\u0027d be careful with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick had seen Bill demonstrate this technique before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Ruby raised her right hand to hit him with the truncheon, Bill was going to grab her arm, turn, and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethrow her over his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would land flat on her back with a painful thump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right, gypsy girl,\" Bill said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hit me with the truncheon, as hard as you like.\" Ruby lifted her arm, and Bill moved toward her, but the action did not follow the usual pattern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Bill reached for Ruby\u0027s arm, it was not there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truncheon fell to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby moved close to Bill and brought her knee up hard into his groin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave a sharp cry of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed his shirtfront, pulled him toward her sharply, and butted his nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, with her sturdy black laced shoe, she kicked his shin, and he fell to the ground, blood pouring from his nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bitch, you weren\u0027t supposed to do that!\" he yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Gestapo are a lot worse than me,\" said Ruby.
