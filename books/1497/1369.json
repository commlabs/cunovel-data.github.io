{"id":48003,"no":1369,"title":"Chapter 1369: Hun Lin","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eChapter 1369: Hun Lin\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man and a woman’s tall figures slowly stepped out of the empty space in front of a countless number of eyes. After which, they steadily stood in the sky. A gentle breeze blew over and their clothes gently danced. They were just like a pair of immortal lovers…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xun Er…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElder Tong Xuan and the others studied the green-clothed woman in the sky before sighing in relief. Xun Er was undoubtedly the most important person within the Gu clan. If any accident were to happen to her, they would end up with a great lose that could not be filled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That is Xiao Yan, huh… this aura…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElder Tong Xuan’s eyes paused on Xun Er before suddenly turning to the black-haired young man beside her. After which, his eyes hardened a little, and a surprise appeared within them. With his eyesight, he could naturally sense that Xiao Yan’s aura had reached that of an eight star Dou Zun. This was many times stronger than half a year ago!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“His strength has increased by three stars… what frightening speed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome Elders faced each other. There was a shock that could not be hidden on their faces. Even though the Heavenly Tomb was mysterious and possessed a unique flow of time, it was quite incredible for one to raise one’s strength by three stars during three years. At the very least, it was the first time that they had witnessed someone improve so much, even when compared to the many people that had entered the Heavenly Tomb before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Could it be… because of Xiao Xuan’s tomb?” Elder Tong Xuan slightly frowned. He was extremely knowledgable and was aware of how difficult it was to raise one’s strength by three stars. After musing for a moment, he thought of the tomb that Xiao Xuan had left behind in the Heavenly Tomb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan and Xun Er in the sky looked around them while being stared at by the many pairs of eyes. They deeply inhaled some fresh air. After having been shut within the ancient hall for a long time, the outside world appeared extremely beautiful to them…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is unexpected that even Hun Ya and Hun Li’s corpses were sent out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s eyes suddenly paused on the two corpses suspended in the sky. His brows were lifted unnoticeably as he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ha ha, brother Xiao Yan, it is unexpected that your strength has already reached this stage after just two years…” Huo Xuan led Huo Zhi over with a smile. He arrived while Xiao Yan was muttering to himself. Huo Xuan then cupped his hands together and laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Brother Huo Xuan has also progressed quite quickly.” Xiao Yan smiled and replied. He could naturally tell that the current Huo Xuan was reaching the peak of an eight star Dou Zun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How can I compare with you…” Huo Xuan bitterly laughed. Two years ago, Xiao Yan was merely a six star Dou Zun while he was an eight star Dou Zun. Now, Xiao Yan had reached the peak of an eight star Dou Zun while he had merely advanced from the initial stage of an eight star Dou Zun to a position near the peak of an eight star Dou Zun. If one were to talk about it, he was a little weaker than Xiao Yan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan smiled. He understood that it would have been impossible for his strength to soar this much if he had not obtained Xiao Xuan’s inheritance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Congratulations.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu Qing Yang’s group also came over while Xiao Yan was conversing with Huo Xuan. All of them smiled and congratulated Xiao Yan. Xiao Yan smiled and responded to their congratulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“These two fellows are really unlucky.” Gu Qing Yang glanced at the two icy-cold corpses suspended in the sky before he suddenly commented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s brows twitched when he heard this. He immediately replied without leaving a trace, “It can be considered retribution.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing Xiao Yan’s response, Gu Qing Yang could guess that the matter of the Hun duo’s deaths was likely related to Xiao Yan, especially since his strength had soared. If he joined hands with Xun Er, it was not impossible to kill Hun Ya and Hun Li.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This matter will likely be a little troublesome. There’s someone from the Hun clan guarding here for the appearance of Hun Ya and Hun Li…” Gu Qing Yang softly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s heart shook when he heard these words. He was just about to speak when he suddenly saw two black fogs rushing over from the distant sky like black dragons. They appeared beside those two icy corpses a moment later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hun Ya! Hun Li!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two black fogs shook. They transformed into two black-robed old men who stared at Hun Ya and Hun Li’s corpses. It appeared as though they were struck by lightning. Neither of them had expected that the two, who had entered the Heavenly Tomb, would actually die!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose people around also hurriedly pulled back when they saw their eyes redden. They were afraid that these two old men would suddenly turn crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hu…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two black-robed old men’s eyes reddened, and they began to pant like a bull. A moment later, they suddenly exchanged glances. Their eyes suddenly turned and looked at Xiao Yan in the sky. Before Hun Ya and Hun Li had entered the Heavenly Tomb, they were aware that Hun Ya and Hun Li were planning on killing Xiao Yan in the Heavenly Tomb. However, Xiao Yan was currently fine and his strength had even soared. On the other hand, Hun Ya and Hun Li had ended up with a miserable fate. This scene caused them to immediately place their doubts on Xiao Yan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xiao Yan!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of them viciously stared at Xiao Yan. A moment later, one of them was unable to endure any longer. A furious roar that contained a murderous desire resounded across the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan slid his calm eyes over when he heard the roar. He asked in a faint voice, “Is there anything you wish to say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A life for a life!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe expression of that black-robed man was extremely gloomy. His sleeve trembled after his final word sounded. A black chain that contained a dark chilly aura penetrated empty air and ruthlessly shot toward Xiao Yan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s expression did not change when faced with the black-robed old man’s sudden attack. He took a step forward and extended a flame-covered palm. His hand firmly grabbed the dark-black chain. A purple-brown fire followed the chain and rushed down before attacking the old man!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmph!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat black-clothed elder coldly snorted when he saw Xiao Yan retaliating. He clenched his fist.The black fog was just like a poisonous dragon as it followed the chain and emitted a roar. It ruthlessly collided with the purple-brown line of fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bang!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fire and black fog exploded upon contact. The powerful force cut through the chain…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chain exploded in the sky, and a powerful wind swept away from the point of explosion. Xiao Yan’s shoulders shook and the wind was removed. On the other hand, that black-clothed old man staggered back. Clearly, he was at a disadvantage in this exchange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Old man, a person should not behave so shamelessly!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan threw aside the chain in his hand. His eyes were icy-cold as they focused on the black clothed elder. He coldly laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black-clothed old man stabilized his body. His expression was extremely ugly. The old man’s strength was around an eight star Dou Zun, but he did not expect Xiao Yan to gain the advantage in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hun Lin, this is the Gu Realm, not your Hun Realm!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElder Tong Xuan also frowned as he spoke in a deep voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmph, Xuan Tong, members of our Hun clan have lost their lives in this place of yours. All of you share the blame!” That old man who was called Hun Lin furiously cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xiao Yan, I think that you should obediently follow me back to the Hun clan. If you are really not the murderer of Hun Ya and Hun Li, we will definitely not make things difficult for you.” The other black-clothed old man coldly cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Preposterous….” Xiao Yan could not resist laughing out loud when he heard this. These two old fellows were really foolish. They were actually able to say such words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Misters, the Heavenly Tomb is filled with danger. No one dares to guarantee that one will be able to smoothly exit it. If you do not have the evidence to prove that Xiao Yan ge-ge is the murderer, please do not randomly attack. This place is after all my Gu clan.” Xun Er’s pretty eyes glanced at the Hun Lin duo as she faintly spoke. “Additionally, this matter is not considered over. Hun Ya and Hun Li once launched a sneak attack on everyone from our Gu clan in the Heavenly Tomb. The two of you will perhaps have to give an explanation for this!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe many eyes in the sky emitted a ‘swoosh’ sound as they shifted to the two Hun elders when they heard Xun Er’s words. Most of those present were members of the Gu clan. Hence, those eyes vaguely contained some ill intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hun Lin, is what Xun Er said true?” Elder Tong Xuan’s expression gradually became ugly. He looked at Hun Li and Hun Ya before crying out in a deep voice. Xun Er possessed the divine bloodline. She was undoubtedly the most important person in the Gu clan. If Hun Ya and Hun Li really dared to attack her, he would definitely teach the elders an unforgettable lesson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe faces of Hun Lin’s duo changed when they saw that Xun Er had turned the tables on them. They did not expect Hun Ya and Hun Li to be so bold. They dared to attack Xun Er’s group in the Heavenly Tomb, but it was obvious that they must not admit that Xun Er’s group was attacked at this moment no matter what. Hun Li coldly cried out, “Hmph, what unreasonable words. You are only trying to clear yourself of suspicion. Today, we are in the Gu Realm and the two of us can indeed do nothing. However, Xiao Yan, you better remember that the Hun clan will definitely take revenge for Hun Ya and Hun Li in the future!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s face was calm. He faintly replied, “I will remember your words in my heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eyes of the Hun elders became dark and cold when they heard Xiao Yan’s reply. Forget about the members of the Gu clan present. With the increase in Xiao Yan’s strength, the two of them would have difficulty capturing him. All they could do was wave their hands and grab Hun Li and Hun Ya’s corpses. Their face were furiously green as they turned into two black shadows that rushed to the exit of the Gu Realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cold expression flashed across Xiao Yan’s eyes as he watched the two figures grow distant. His eyes swept carefully around him. However, he discovered that the Little Fairy Doctor’s group was absent. This discovery caused him to frown. The Little Fairy Doctor’s group would definitely leave one person waiting for him unless there were some special circumstances…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Could it be that something has happened to the Falling Star Pavilion?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1368\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1370\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1369","bookId":1497,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:54 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:54 AM"}
