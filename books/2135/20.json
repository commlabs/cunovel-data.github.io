On the list were three names: Caesar Marquez\u0027s trainer, cut-man and manager, all three of which would have been in Caesar\u0027s locker room prior to the fight. And prior was key here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, something had happened to Caesar before the fight, something that had directly led to his death. What it was remained to be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I followed behind an endless sea of red brake lights, my cell rang for perhaps the dozenth time that day. And for the dozenth time that day, I saw that it was Kingsley Fulcrum. This time, as the phone rang, a text message appeared. Virtually simultaneously. I guess the big oaf could multi-task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe text message read: Sam, please pick up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about ignoring him again, until I realized the hairy bastard would just keep calling me...and since I wasn\u0027t in any kind of mood to see him face to face, I thought I might as well hear what he had to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang again and, when it was about to go to voicemail, I picked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s your dime,\" I said flippantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Sam! I was just about to hang up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was valuable information to have. Thank you for sharing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be this way, Sam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What way?\" I asked. \"Hurt? Betrayed? How would you suggest I be instead, Kingsley? Ecstatic that a man I was falling in love with fucked another woman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sam, we need to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not like this. Not over the phone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps in your bed where you fucked her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sam...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited. I had broken out in a sweat. Many of my human functions had stopped altogether, but sweating was not one of them. I sweated with the best of them, especially in a warm minivan on a long drive to L.A., and dealing with this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, swearing silently. Kingsley and I had been dating over eight months now. I had just started feeling the love again. Had just started letting him in, had just started getting over the pain of my cheating ex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sam,\" he tried again. \"How did you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe must have thought hard about that because he paused good and long. \"No. I guess not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I knew it was eating at him. Good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were silent some more. Traffic on the 5 Freeway was sick. It was midday and I had already made plans for Mary Lou to pick up the kids. I had made special plans to be with Tammy tonight. So had Mary Lou. We were going to have a girl\u0027s night out, so to speak. No boys allowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was she?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t honestly know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She just...appeared in the office. Wanted to make an appointment. Flirted with me endlessly. Caught me as I was leaving work for the day. Walked with me out to my car. Laughed at everything I said. Touched me, asked me questions. Then asked if I wanted to get a drink with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you said yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" said Kingsley. \"I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t have to say yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, Sam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a lot of silence on his end. I could hear him breathing, each breath pouring over the receiver as if he were in a sporadic windstorm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know why, Sam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes you do. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She gave me a lot of attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lots of women give you attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prettier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prettier than me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t say that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t have to. So at what point did you fuck her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sam, how do you know this? Did you plant her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that\u0027s when I hung up on him, nearly crushing my cell phone in the process. He cheats on me...and turns it around? The fucker. The piece of shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as I drove into the afternoon sun, feeling eternally exhausted and too hurt for tears, I realized that Kingsley had been partially right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been set up. Just not by me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-games-vampire-for-hire-6/page-20.html","bookId":2135,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:12:12 PM"}
