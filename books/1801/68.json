I didn\u0027t tell him the link we have in bed seems to have already extended itself to other occasions. Normally the ability to sense when one\u0027s Shieldmate is in distress or exuberantly happy is an evolving process that takes years of living together to mature into anything that might be labeled telepathic. Even then it would be hard to distinguish it from the normal empathy that seems to develop between a man and a woman who live together for years. Except in bed, of course, where it stays unique. But with us it was there almost from the beginning. It\u0027s sporadic at this point, but it\u0027s also very strong. I think it\u0027s going to eventually grow even stronger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSariana thought of the image of her backside that had popped into her mind while she was on the river sled. She tugged on her lower lip and gazed into the fire while she considered it. Experimentally she tried projecting it toward Gryph, just as she had projected her passionate demands the night before. She glanced at Gryph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see what I mean?\" he said with an understanding expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We would have no privacy at all,\" Sariana said in shock as she considered the ramifications. He shook his head reassuringly. \"I don\u0027t think it will work like that. I think we will have to be actively\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eprojecting in order to send anything even remotely comprehensible. Just like working prisma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what about that - that lewd picture of myself that just appeared in my head yesterday?\" He grinned, showing his teeth in the firelight. \"I was bored. For once you didn\u0027t seem inclined to talk so\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to do a little, experimenting. I just wanted to see what would happen if I tried projecting a scene into your mind. This is the first time you\u0027ve admitted you picked up on it. Until now I had no way of knowing whether or not you had received it. Which should tell you something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does it tell me?\" Sariana asked automatically, Then she leaped to the obvious conclusion. \"Oh, I see. I didn\u0027t send anything back to you so you had no way of knowing if I had gotten the message.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. I\u0027ll admit I don\u0027t know much about telepathy. Shields and their mates have always just skirted the edges of anything that could be labeled genuine telepathy. But judging from what I\u0027ve learned by working prisma, I\u0027d say it\u0027s not a passive process. It takes strength and a deliberate focus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And both factors come into play automatically under conditions of extreme stress, is that it?\" \"And under conditions of passion,\" he added blandly. \"Don\u0027t fret, Sariana, I can\u0027t read your mind any\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emore than any other man can read a woman\u0027s mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s a relief,\" she tried to say lightly. The truth was she was feeling extremely nervous about the whole matter. She rose and settled herself onto a convenient rock. \"What are we going to do now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my Sariana,\" he said approvingly. \"Back to business when things get sticky. Now, thanks to you, I\u0027ve got a fix on a large source of prisma somewhere in this gorge. Tomorrow morning I will stash you safely here in this cove and then I will see if I can track the beams to their point of origin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t like the casual way he said that. \"Then what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGryph shrugged in that gracefully negligent manner all westerners seemed to be born with. \"Then I\u0027ll\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edecide what to do about it. If I think there\u0027s enough time, I\u0027ll wait until Delek and the others arrive. If there isn\u0027t time, I\u0027ll try to neutralize the weapons on my own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can one Shield neutralize a whole shipload of the prisma weapons?\" \"If he\u0027s strong enough. And if the ship is a small one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How strong are you, Gryph?\" Sariana asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" he told her. \"No Shield learns the limits of his own strength until he actually confronts a weapon ship. I\u0027ve never even seen a ship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" She sat in silence for a while, dunking over what he had said. \"If it turns out you aren\u0027t strong enough to neutralize the weapons and if you have no backup, what happens?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You worry too much, Sariana,\" he said calmly. He got to his feet and began banking the fire. \"We have a lot to do tomorrow morning. I think we\u0027d better get to bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSariana started to demand an answer to her question, but she stopped, realizing she could guess the answer from his evasive response. Whatever happened to a Shield who lacked sufficient strength to neutralize his target, it wasn\u0027t pleasant. Perhaps it meant death. Or insanity. Sariana shivered and folded her cloak more tightly about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scarlet-toe on her shoulder yawned sleepily as Sariana reached up to pat it with the tip of her finger. Gryph moved around the fire, his actions efficient and economical as he made preparations for securing the campsite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How close do you think that ship is?\" Sariana asked, glancing out into the night-shrouded canyon. \"Several kilometers away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if this rogue Shield is watching for intruders into this gorge?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve told you not to worry, haven\u0027t I?\" Gryph asked with soft humor. \"When are you going to learn to follow simple instructions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, Gryph - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If there is a rogue behind all this, my guess is he\u0027ll be sticking close to his prize. He\u0027s not out here prowling through the night. I\u0027d know if he were. There is no prisma nearby other than my lock. It\u0027s not hard to estimate distance with prisma rays. You do it with a simple formula.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to worry about you tomorrow,\" Sariana said bluntly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGryph took off his boots, crossed the sand toward her and handed her the boots. Then he swung her up into his arms. \"I\u0027m just selfish enough to admit I\u0027m going to like having you worry about me. But you\u0027ll be safe, Shield-mate. I\u0027ll make certain of that before I leave you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waded out to the sled, lifted her over the low railing and set her on her feet. She clutched his boots while she waited for him to jump lightly on board the sled. The moon was directly overhead and a narrow strip of golden light managed to seep as far as the river canyon floor. It gilded the black depths of Gryph\u0027s hair and highlighted the arrogant planes of his harsh face. Sariana remembered the buckle she had purchased at the fair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I almost forgot,\" she murmured as she went over to her travel pouch and opened it. \"I have a present for you.\" She smiled as she turned around to hand him the small package.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGryph looked oddly startled. He stared at her in the moonlight and then his gaze dropped to the package in her hand. \"For me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027t know anyone else who needs this quite as much as you do,\" she leased. \"Here. Open it.\" His usually deft fingers rumbled slightly with the wrapping, but a moment later the exquisitely detailed \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shield-s-lady-lost-colony-3/page-68.html","bookId":1801,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:33:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:33:09 PM"}
