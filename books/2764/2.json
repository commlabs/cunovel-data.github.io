That\u0027s why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo this has nothing to do with Ron wanting to get to know me and spend time with me. No from now on I want to be the father I always should have been from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shouldn\u0027t be disappointed, but I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boarding now for El Al flight 001 to Tel Aviv with a connection in Newark,\" a voice with an Israeli accent blasts through the loudspeaker. \"Passengers in rows turdy-five to forty-five please have your boarding cards and passports out for the attendants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell you what,\" Ron says. \"I\u0027ll give you back the phone if you\u0027ll cooperate and get on that plane. Deal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if I have any other option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" I say and hold out my hand. At least I\u0027ll have my little connection to sanity and independence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hands me the phone and I reluctantly follow him on the plane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon and I are assigned to row sixty, the last row. I\u0027m kind of glad nobody will be sitting behind me so I can rest comfortably on the twelve-hour flight to Tel Aviv.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless, of course, a bomb is planted on the plane or terrorists hijack it and we die before we even get to the war zone. As I think about terrorists on the plane, I look over at Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard there are air marshals on all El Al flights,\" I say as I shove my backpack under the seat in front of me. \"Is it true?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know if I\u0027ve ever actually started a conversation with Ron before, and he seems stunned. He looks around to see if I\u0027m asking someone else the question before he answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"El Al has always had air marshals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many?\" Because if there\u0027s only one air marshall against five terrorists, the air marshall is toast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A lot. Don\u0027t worry, El Al\u0027s security is second to none.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh huh,\" I say, not very convinced as I look to my left at a guy with a mono-brow who looks pretty suspicious. Mr. Mono-brow smiles at me. His smile fades as I realize Ron is glaring at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter so many years with Ron as a \u0027birthday only\u0027 figure in my life, I feel like he doesn\u0027t have any right to say he\u0027s my dad. When I was younger and he came to take me for my annual birthday outing, I worshipped the ground he walked on. He was like this superhero who granted my every wish and treated me like a \"princess for a day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut by the time I realized a father should actually be there for you every day, I started resenting him. Last year I actually blew him off. I snuck out of the house, left a note I\u0027d gone out with friends, and came back after dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom isn\u0027t easy. She throws men away for sport. But from what I know of Ron, he was once a commando in the Israeli Defense Forces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA commando who\u0027s too chickenshit to fight for marriage to a woman he impregnated isn\u0027t worth much in my book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won\u0027t be like my mother when I\u0027m older. I won\u0027t be like Ron, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore long, we land in Newark to pick up more passengers. I\u0027ve never eaten sardines, but when people start piling in and filling each and every empty spot on the plane, the disgusting little fishes come to mind. It boggles my mind how many people pack the plane to fly to a place on the warning list for American citizens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we lift off, I push that little button to recline my seat because I\u0027m starting to get tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly since we have the back row, I realize pretty quickly the back row doesn\u0027t recline. Okay, now this isn\u0027t funny. It\u0027s not just a short flight to Orlando. This is a whopping twelve-hour flight to a place I don\u0027t want to go to in the first place to meet a sick grandmother I didn\u0027t know existed in the first place. (That\u0027s two first places, I know, but at this point nothing in my life that bugs me is second place ... it all takes first place.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I try and force the chair to recline for the fifth time and the person in front of me reclines theirs so far back I hardly have room for my legs, this feeling in the pit of my stomach makes me want to cry. I can\u0027t help it. I hate this plane, I hate Mom for making me come on this stupid trip, and I hate Ron for just about everything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few hours I get up to go to the bathroom, this time for real. Unfortunately, at least one hundred people have already used the facilities and the floor is full of little pieces of unflushed toilet paper shreds. To top it off (in the first place) the floor is full of these little droplets. Are the droplets pee or water? My Dansko clogs are not used to being subjected to this kind of abuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI go back to my seat and to my astonishment I\u0027m finally able to get into a comfortable, albeit upright, sleeping position. Sleep right now would be bliss. The captain turns off all the lights and I close my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone yells, and I\u0027m jerked awake from dreamland. Right above me, like practically in my face, is a Hasidic\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJew. You know, one of those guys who wears a black hat and coat and has long, curly sideburns running down his face and neck. Jessica (she\u0027s Jewish) told me they\u0027re ultra, ultra religious and try to follow all of God\u0027s six hundred or so rules. I have enough trouble following my mom\u0027s rules, let alone six hundred of God\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt takes me a minute to realize his eyes are closed and he\u0027s praying. But he\u0027s not praying in his seat, he\u0027s praying right over mine. He\u0027s bobbing up and down, his eyes are shut, and his face is in total concentration. In fact, as my eyes focus in the dark, I realize all of the Hasidic Jews have congregated at the back of the plane to pray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it doesn\u0027t sound like prayers at all, more like some chant mixed with mumbling. They might not even be praying. But then one of the guys, I guess he\u0027s the leader, says a couple of words loudly and they all respond and keep on doing their mumbling chant. Yeah, they\u0027re praying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo they all have to do it at the same time?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what are those straps on the back of their hands and arms or the box strapped to their forehead?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that I watch them more intently, I admire the men for being so devoted to their religion they would pray instead of sleep. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I admire it, but I wouldn\u0027t do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look over at Ron, sound asleep. He\u0027s a good-looking man, if you like the dark, brooding kind of guy. Which I don\u0027t. My mother is pastey white and has blond hair and green eyes. She was probably in her \"opposite\" stage when she and my dad got together that fateful night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder if Ron wishes I wasn\u0027t born. If he\u0027d chosen to stay at his cousin\u0027s dorm room at the University of Illinois, instead of following my mom to her sorority house seventeen years ago, then he wouldn\u0027t be stuck with a kid who resented him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes suddenly open and I sit back in my chair, pretending to watch the television screen in front of me without the headphones on my ears. I have one good thing to say about El Al Israel Airline--it has personal television screens embedded into the backs of every single seat. A miracle in its own right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027ll like it there,\" Ron says. \"Even though I\u0027ve lived in America for seventeen years, Israel will always be apart of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And ...?\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shifts in his seat and looks at me straight on. \"And your grandmudder will want it to be a part of you, too. Don\u0027t disappoint her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blink and give him my famous sneer, the one where my top lip curls up just the right amount. \"You\u0027ve got to be kidding. Don\u0027t disappoint her 7 . I didn\u0027t know she existed before yesterday. What about her disappointing me? If you haven\u0027t forgotten, she hasn\u0027t been the doting grandma.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelieve me, I know people who have doting grandmas. Jessica\u0027s Grandma Pearl spent four years knitting her a blanket. Four years! And she\u0027s got arthritis. I wonder what Grandma Pearl would think if she knew Jessica lost her virginity to Michael Greenberg under the blanket she spent four years knitting with her crooked fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon sighs and turns his attention to his little personal television screen. I note he\u0027s not wearing the headphones, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit back. There\u0027s a long silence, so long I think if I look at him I\u0027ll find him sleeping again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do I call her?\" I ask, still staring at the screen in front of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll like it if you call her Safta. It means grandma in Hebrew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Safta,\" I say quietly to myself, trying out how the word sounds coming out of my mouth. Glancing over at the Sperm Donor, I notice he\u0027s nodding. His chin is raised and he\u0027s giving me a little smile like he\u0027s proud. Ugh!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking forward, I turn my personal TV to the channel showing how much longer until we land in Israel. Four hours and fifty-five minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy this time the Hasidic Jews have gone back to their seats. I close my eyes again, thankfully drifting off to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I know it, the flight attendant says something in Hebrew. I wait until the information is repeated in English.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re starting our descent into Tel Aviv, please put your seats in the upright position ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNews flash--my seat has been in the upright position for the whole twelve-hour flight!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not rude, I\u0027m just a teen with attitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe immigration officer inside Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv asks Ron (who has dual Israeli and American citizenship) who I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My daughter,\" he replies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she registered as an Israeli citizen?\" she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs the woman joking? Me? An Israeli citizen? But when I see the serious look on the immigration officer\u0027s face, I panic. I\u0027ve heard of Middle East countries where American kids are taken and aren\u0027t allowed to leave. I don\u0027t want to be Israeli. I want to go home, like right now!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn around, heading back to the plane. Hopefully the captain will let me back on ...I\u0027ll go in the belly of the aircraft, in someone\u0027s luggage, in a damn animal carrier. Just get me out of here!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m almost at the door. Freedom is in sight when I feel a hand on my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy,\" Ron\u0027s familiar brooding voice says from behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn around and face him. \"They won\u0027t let me go back home, will they? You\u0027ve kidnapped me to this country that wants me to be a citizen. Oh, God. They make everyone, even girls, go into the army at eighteen, right? I\u0027ve heard that, don\u0027t try and deny it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know I\u0027m sounding like a crazy sixteen-year-old right now, my voice several octaves higher than usual. I can\u0027t help it and I keep rambling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to make me stay here and be drafted into the army, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can just see them making me trade in my Abercrombie \u0026amp; Fitch for fatigues. My heart is beating fast and little droplets of sweat are running down my face. I swear they\u0027re not tears, just droplets of sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ron, to be honest I doubt I\u0027m even your kid. Did you ever get a paternity test? Because I saw a picture of this one guy my mom dated in college who looks just like me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon looks at the ceiling and lets out a breath. When he looks back at me, his brown eyes are darker than usual. His jaw is clenched tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Calm down, Amy. You\u0027re causing a scene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dude,\" I say really tough, getting a grip on my voice. Now I sound like Angelina Jolie, in that movie where she kicks everyone\u0027s ass that crosses her. \"I haven\u0027t even started to cause a scene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA soldier with a very, very large machine gun walks up to us. He has an almost shaved head and I can tell just by looking at him he has a twitchy trigger finger. Great, my life is over, I\u0027m going to be stuck in this third world country for the rest of my days ...which are probably numbered now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mah carrah?\" the soldier says to Ron in Hebrew. It sounds either like \"Macarena?\" or \"Kill Amy?\" to me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-a-summer-vacation-how-to-ruin-1/page-2.html","bookId":2764,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:04 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:04 PM"}
