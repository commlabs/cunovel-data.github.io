THE ROYAL TAILOR\u0027S BILL FOR GARGANTUA\u0027S SUIT.","content":"\u0026nbsp;When Gargantua had outgrown the age for riding in his ox-cart, and was just beginning to toddle round the palace-walks, it occurred to Father Grandgousier that he was getting to be a big boy. So he ordered the Royal Tailor into his Royal Presence. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So ho! Thou art the clothes-maker, art thou? Now, measure my son, and make a suit for him. His mother says he looks best in blue and white,\" was all he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Royal Tailor bowed humbly, while all the time he was shivering in his fine velvets and silks, at the honor of making clothes for a Giant Prince. For the old King, who simply wanted everything loose and easy-like, it was all well enough; but how would it be when he began to fit the royal heir? was what he kept asking himself. A royal tailor believes in his heart that he is a sort of king-maker, because he makes the clothes that give to a King that grand, imperial air which compels all men to kneel before him. He never will appear the least bit ruffled at the most impossible order given him, provided the order come from a King; but bows and smiles, no matter how sick and angry he may be at heart.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To do the Royal Tailor justice, he did his best with the order given him. He made the clothes—and his bill.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That bill is still kept at Montsoreau. It is really a curiosity, and runs in this way:—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n His Most Gracious Majesty,\n\u003c/div\u003e           \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Engraving\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n MAKING GARGANTUA\u0027S SUIT.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Besides all this quantity of rich cloth for Gargantua\u0027s full court-suit, there was brought from Hyrcania the Wild a bright blue feather for his plume. This plume was held in place by a handsome enameled clasp of gold, weighing sixty-eight marks, which the Crown Jewellers, by his father\u0027s orders, with great care, made for him; also a ring for the forefinger of his left hand, with a carbuncle in it as large as an ostrich-egg; and a great chain of gold berries to wear around his neck, weighing twenty-five thousand and sixty-three marks.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Engraving\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n MEASURING GARGANTUA FOR HIS SUIT.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3043/84062.html","bookId":1031,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 4:00:58 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 4:00:58 AM"}
