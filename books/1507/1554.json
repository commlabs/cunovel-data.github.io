Countless Outsiders had black smoke emanating from their heads, which then swirled around them and bored into their eyes, ears, noses, and mouths. Their eyes went wide, shining with pain. Soon, they began to topple over to the ground as they were killed by the Mountain and Sea Realm cultivators in their own memories!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the same magical technique that Meng Hao had dealt with when fighting the will of Allheaven in the form of Chen Fan. That, of course, was before he had reached Transcendence. He had never faced anything like that before, and it affected him deeply. After Transcending, his own cultivation base allowed him to understand how the technique worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTranscendent cultivators... were omnipotent!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll they had to do was think of something, and it could be done!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a Realm occupied by the Immortal, the God, the Devil, the Ghost, and the Demon!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao waved his hand, and the 13th Heaven collapsed. The souls of the dead Outsiders were extracted and thrown into the sea of flames to burn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the 13th Heaven fell apart, flaming rubble smashed into the 12th Heaven below. Mountains collapsed, buildings were destroyed, cities were ravaged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Outsiders of the 12th Heaven laughed bitterly. They wanted to fight back, but were unable to. They wanted to self-detonate, but couldn’t. The only thing they could do was wait to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, the sea of flames up above contained innumerable burning souls, which led the remaining Outsiders to clearly understand that death... was not the end for them. True death was not such an easy thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao looked coldly at the 12th Heaven for a moment before sending his divine sense out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hereby seal your minds, and reduce you to nothing but instinct. Slaughter your fellows!” Instantly, all of the Outsiders on the 12th Heaven began to tremble. Most of these particular Outsiders had two heads with red eyes, and grossly fat bodies that almost didn’t resemble humans. As of this moment, their minds were suddenly taken over. Erased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe energy of Heaven and Earth was Meng Hao’s Daosource energy, and it was all-powerful. If I want you to have something, you WILL have it. If I don’t want you to have something, you WILL NOT have it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumbling could be heard as the two-headed Outsiders let out ferocious roars. Their minds were gone, leaving behind only animalistic instinct. Meng Hao’s echoing voice had left them bereft of their nature, and without a second thought, they turned and began to viciously attack their fellow people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, Meng Hao didn\u0027t completely remove their minds. They were still there, just unable to do anything other than watch. There was no way for them to interfere with their own instincts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao hovered in midair, watching the slaughter. A moment later, he suddenly realized that this revenge did not make him happy. He only felt deep grief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin that grief, he couldn’t help but ask himself if he was any different from the Outsiders back when they were exacting their revenge. After some thought, he realized something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe slaughtering didn’t make him happy. Although he was smiling, that smile contained profound sadness. He was being ruthless to be sure, but that ruthlessness came because of bitterness that came from thousands of years in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen one lives in a world of hatred, then either they die, or their enemies die!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack when the Outsiders had been massacring the cultivators of the Mountain and Sea Realm, they had been excited, elated even.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao looked down at the land mass below. As the Outsiders ripped each other to shreds like animals, their bloodcurdling screams gradually began to fade away. Soon, everything was quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy this point, the bloody battle royale resulted in only a handful of Outsiders remaining alive. Meng Hao waved his hand, causing countless souls to fly up into the sea of flames. Then, the 12th Heaven’s land mass was destroyed, causing rubble to rain down onto the 11th Heaven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere, the Outsiders were trembling. They began to shout, eyes filled with hatred, fear, and entreaties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao looked at them calmly for a moment, the red glow in his eyes growing more intense. Then he reached out with his right hand and made a pushing gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly, the entire land mass began to quake and distort. Mountains twisted, the ground shifted, rivers evaporated. The entire 11th Heaven began to change shape, as if it were being kneaded by giant hands. Soon, it no longer looked like a land mass. Instead, it resembled a giant clay pill furnace!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe land mass became the pill furnace, and the Outsiders became the medicinal ingredients. When the Outsiders from the 10th Heaven saw what was happening, they were overwhelmed by despair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao looked at gargantuan pill furnace, then snapped his fingers. Rumbling sounds echoed out as it began to heat up, rapidly turning crimson from the intense heat. This was a pill-concocting magic in which the entire continent was used to refine all the Outsiders into... a gigantic medicinal pill of gore!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe huge pill furnace trembled, and screaming began to echo out. However, the sounds soon faded away. In the end, nothing could be heard at all. Eventually, the pill furnace exploded, and countless souls emerged, which shot into the sea of flames up above. At the same time, a medicinal pill appeared, fist-sized and the color of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao looked at the pill, his expression placid. Only by looking closely would it be possible to see the exhaustion and grief in his eyes. After a moment, he flicked his sleeve, sending the medicinal pill flying toward the old lizard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take it,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lizard gaped in shock. Then it eyed the pill for a moment before chomping it down. The lizard shivered, and then visibly grew younger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao looked down at the 10th Heaven for a moment, and the despairing Outsiders there, before finally closing his eyes and taking a deep breath. He had come to a realization just now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Getting revenge alone is a bit selfish. I\u0027ve been suffocating for thousands of years, but so have all the cultivators of the Mountain and Sea Realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pressure like that can only be released by the blood of the Outsiders.” His eyes shone brightly as he waved his hand in the direction of the remaining Heavens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hereby decree that all Outsiders from the other Heavens will drop an entire cultivation realm!” His words instantly changed the natural laws of the 1st through 10th Heavens. in that instant, all Outsiders trembled as their cultivation bases were thrown into chaos, and they dropped by an entire realm!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7-Essences became Dao Sovereigns. 6-Essences dropped to 5-Essences. 1-Essence Dao Realm experts reverted to the Ancient Realm. Not a single Outsider escaped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was not a sealing. This was a true and utter loss, something unrecoverable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hereby strip away all Outsiders’ divine sense!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hereby strip away all Outsiders’ power of flight!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hereby strip away all Outsiders’ regenerative powers!” Each sentence echoed like Heaven-rending Earth-crushing thunder. Natural laws were born and changed, and as soon as the words left his mouth, they became reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly, all remaining Outsiders’ cultivation bases dropped, their divine sense was rendered useless, and they couldn\u0027t fly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was not something that could be accomplished by means of divine abilities and magical techniques. It was like a Godly miracle, an Immortal magic, or a Demonic Dao!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy now, all the Outsiders had experienced the terrifying and unimaginable nature of Meng Hao’s cultivation realm. The most powerful experts who remained alive in the various Heavens trembled as they spoke Meng Hao’s level aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“... Transcendence!” The powerful experts’ despair had reached the pinnacle as they realized that even the Immortal God Continent and the Devil Realm Continent would be like ants in comparison to a Transcendent cultivator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause the Mountain and Sea Realm had produced a Transcendent cultivator, it was destined... to shake the starry sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, Meng Hao’s gaze pierced down through the Heavenly land masses into the Mountain and Sea Butterfly. Kindness could be seen in his eyes as he waved his finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly, the Mountain and Sea Butterfly shivered, and its wings flapped. It was as if the gate to the world had been opened, as countless Mountain and Sea Realm cultivators instantly flew out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hereby bless all Mountain and Sea cultivators’ divine sense power!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hereby bless all Mountain and Sea cultivators’ power to fly through the starry sky!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hereby bless all Mountain and Sea cultivators’ magical techniques!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hereby bless all Mountain and Sea cultivators’ fleshly body power!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hereby bless all Mountain and Sea cultivators’ regenerative powers!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hereby... give all you my blessing!” As Meng Hao’s voice echoed out, the cultivators of the Mountain and Sea Realm flying out from the butterfly felt their cultivation bases rumbling. All of them began to radiate blinding light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany of them were stunned. Although they couldn’t see Meng Hao through all of the land masses, they could hear his soft voice in their minds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mountain and Sea cultivators, I am Meng Hao.... The hatred of the Mountain and Sea Realm has been simmering for thousands of years. Sacrifice the blood of the Outsiders to rise up from within the sea of hatred. Soar high into the starry sky. The time has come to remould the Mountain and Sea Realm. I will be waiting for you on the 10th Heaven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao\u0027s gaze then came to rest on the wings of the Mountain and Sea Butterfly. There, he could see his father and mother, as well as a young woman who was there to accompany them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wore a long white garment, and was beautiful. She looked just like Meng Hao remembered her: simple, pure, and resolute. However, she somehow seemed... more fragile than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-9-chapter-1550\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-9-chapter-1552\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-9-chapter-1551","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM"}
