A pickup with a staircase bolted to the load bed came slowly out to meet it. The pickup was followed by a minivan. Both vehicles were shiny clean and painted in Boeing\u0027s corporate colors. The flight crew stayed on board to analyze computer data. The minivan took Reacher and Harper around to the arrivals lane, where the taxis waited. Head of the line was a battered Caprice with a checkerboard stripe down the side. The driver wasn\u0027t local. He needed to check his map to find the road east toward the tiny village on the slopes of Mount Hood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSHE WAS IN the house all of five minutes, and then the doorbell went. The cop was back. She came out of the kitchen and walked the length of the hallway and unlocked the door. Opened it up. He was standing there on the porch, not saying anything, trying to communicate his request with the rueful expression on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she just looked at him. Didn\u0027t smile or anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" he said back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited. She was going to make him say it anyway. It was nothing to be embarrassed about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guess what?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I use the powder room?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCold air was swirling in around her legs. She could feel it striking through her jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed the door behind him, to keep some warmth in. Waited next to it, while he disappeared and then came back again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice and warm in here,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, although it wasn\u0027t really true. She kept the house as cold as she could stand it. For the piano tone. So the wood didn\u0027t dry out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cold out there in the car,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Run the motor,\" she said. \"Get the heater going.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Not allowed. Can\u0027t idle the engine. Some pollution thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So take off for a spell,\" she said. \"Drive around, get warm. I\u0027ll be OK here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearly it wasn\u0027t the invitation he was looking for, but he thought about it. Then he shook his head again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027d take my badge,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve got to stay here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry to bother you with that padre,\" he said, making the point he\u0027d intervened, and gotten rid of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bring you some hot coffee,\" she said. \"Five minutes, OK?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked pleased. A shy smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027ll need the powder room again,\" he said. \"Goes right through me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whenever,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed the door on him and went back to the kitchen and set her coffee machine going. Waited on the stool next to the shopping bags until it was done. She found the biggest mug she owned and poured the coffee. Added cream from the refrigerator and sugar from the cupboard. He looked like a cream-and-sugar guy, young, a little fat. She carried the mug outside and walked down the path. Steam swirled off the coffee and hung in a thin horizontal band all the way to the sidewalk. She tapped on his window and he turned and smiled and buzzed the glass down. He took the cup, awkwardly, two-handed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe touched it to his lips like an extra gesture of politeness and she walked away, into the driveway, up the path, in through the door. She closed it behind her and locked it and turned around to find the visitor she was expecting standing quietly at the head of the stairs from the garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Rita,\" the visitor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello,\" she said back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE TAXI DROVE south on 205 and found the left turn east on 26. It rode like its next trip should be to the scrap heap. The colors inside the door seams didn\u0027t match the outside. It had probably already done three years in New York, and maybe three more in the suburbs of Chicago. But it moved along steadily enough, and its meter clicked a lot slower than it would have in New York or Chicago. And that was important, because Reacher had just realized he had almost no money in his pockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why is a demonstration of mobility important?\" Harper asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s one of the big lies,\" Reacher said. \"We just swallowed it whole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSCIMECA STOOD THERE inside her front door, calmly. The visitor gazed back at her from the other end of the hallway, eyes inquiring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you buy the paint?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I did,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, are you ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visitor watched her a moment longer, just gazing, very calm, eyes steady.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you ready now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visitor smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027re ready. I really do. What do you think? Are you ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m ready,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you apologize to the cop?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded again. \"Yes, I told him I was sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has to be allowed in, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told him, whenever he needs it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has to find you. He has to be the one. That\u0027s the way I want it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" Scimeca said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visitor was silent for a long moment, just standing there, saying nothing, watching carefully. Scimeca waited, awkward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, he should be the one to find me,\" she said. \"If that\u0027s the way you want it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did good with the padre,\" the visitor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wanted to help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody can help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess not,\" Scimeca said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go into the kitchen,\" the visitor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScimeca moved away from the door. Squeezed past the visitor in the narrow hallway and led the way into her kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The paint is right here,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Show me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScimeca took the can out of the bag and held it up by the wire handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s olive green,\" she said. \"Closest they had.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visitor nodded. \"Good. You did very well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScimeca blushed with pleasure. A tiny pink flush under the white of her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you need to concentrate,\" the visitor said. \"Because I\u0027m going to give you a lot of information.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About what I want you to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScimeca nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First thing, you have to smile for me,\" the visitor said. \"That\u0027s very important. It means a lot to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" Scimeca said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So can you smile for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try it, OK?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t smile much anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visitor nodded, sympathetic. \"I know, but just try now, OK?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScimeca ducked her head and concentrated and came back up with a shy, weak smile. Just a faint new angle to her lips, but it was something. She held it, desperately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s nice,\" the visitor said. \"Now remember, I want you smiling all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got to be happy in our work, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need something to open the can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My tools are downstairs,\" Scimeca said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you got a screwdriver?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Scimeca said. \"I\u0027ve got eight or nine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go get a big one for me, would you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And don\u0027t forget the smile, OK?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE MUG WAS too big for the Crown Vic\u0027s cup holder, so he drank all the coffee straight off because he couldn\u0027t put it down between sips. That always happened. At a party, if he was standing up holding a bottle, he drank it much faster than if he was sitting at a bar where he could sometimes rest it on the napkin. Like smoking. If there was an ashtray to rest the butt in, the cigarette lasted much longer than if he was walking around with it, whereupon he demolished it in about a minute and a half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he was sitting there with the empty mug resting on his thigh, thinking about carrying it back up to the house. Here\u0027s your mug back, he could say. Thanks very much. It would give him another chance to drop a hint about how cold he was. Maybe he could get her to put a chair in the hallway, and he could finish his shift inside. Nobody could complain about that. Better protection that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was nervous about ringing the bell again. She was an uptight character, that was for damn sure. Who knows how she might react, even though he was being real polite, just returning her mug? Even though he\u0027d gotten rid of the chaplain for her? He bounced the mug up and down on his knee and tried to balance out between how cold he was and how offended she might get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE TAXI DROVE on, through Gresham, through Kelso, through Sandy. Route 26 picked up a name, Mount Hood Highway. The grade steepened. The old V-8 dug deep and rumbled upward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is it?\" Harper asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The key is in Poulton\u0027s report from Spokane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"Big and obvious. But it took me some time to spot it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The UPS thing? We went through all of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"No, before that. The Hertz thing. The rental car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSCIMECA CAME BACK up the basement stairs with a screwdriver in her hand. It was the third-largest she had, about eight inches long, with a blade fine enough to slip between the can and the lid, but broad enough to make an effective lever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think this is the best one,\" she said. \"You know, for the purpose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visitor looked at it from a distance. \"I\u0027m sure it\u0027s fine. As long as you\u0027re comfortable with it. You\u0027ll be using it, not me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScimeca nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s good,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So where\u0027s your bathroom?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Upstairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want to show me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring the paint,\" the visitor said. \"And the screwdriver. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScimeca went back to the kitchen and picked up the can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do we need the stirring stick too?\" she called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visitor hesitated. New procedure, needs a new technique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, bring the stirring stick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stick was about twelve inches long, and Scimeca clasped it together with the screwdriver in her left hand. Picked up the can by the handle with her right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This way,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe led the way out of the kitchen and up the stairs. Across the upstairs hallway and into her bedroom. Across the bedroom and into the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is it,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visitor looked it over, and felt like an expert on bathrooms. This one was the fifth, after all. It was medium-budget, probably. A little old-fashioned. But it suited the age of the house. A fancy marble confection would have looked wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put the stuff down on the floor, OK?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScimeca bent and put the can down. The metal made a faint liquid clonk as it hit the tile. She folded the wire handle down and balanced the screwdriver and the stick across the lid. The visitor came out with a folded garbage sack, black plastic, from a coat pocket. Shook it out and held it open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need you to put your clothes in here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHE GOT OUT of the car, with the mug in his hand. Walked around the hood and into the driveway. Up the looping path. Up the porch steps. He juggled the mug into the other hand, ready to ring the bell. Then he paused. It was very quiet inside. No piano music. Was that good or bad? She was kind of obsessive, always playing the same thing over and over again. Probably didn\u0027t like being interrupted in the middle of it. But the fact that she wasn\u0027t playing might mean she was doing something else important. Maybe taking a nap. The Bureau guy said she got up at six. Maybe she took a siesta in the afternoon. Maybe she was reading a book. Whatever she was doing, she probably wasn\u0027t just sitting there hoping he\u0027d come to her door. She hadn\u0027t shown any inclinations along those lines before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood there, indecisive, his hand held out a foot away from her bell. Then he dropped it to his side and turned around and went back down the steps to the path. Back down the path to the driveway. Back around the hood of his car. He got in and leaned over and stood the mug upright in the passenger footwell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSCIMECA LOOKED CONFUSED.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What clothes?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The clothes you\u0027re wearing,\" the visitor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScimeca nodded, vaguely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not happy with the smile, Rita,\" the visitor said. \"It\u0027s slipping a little.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Check it out in the mirror, tell me if that\u0027s a happy face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScimeca turned to the mirror. Gazed for a second and started working on the muscles in her face, one by one. The visitor watched her reflection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make it a big one. Real cheerful, OK?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScimeca turned back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s this?\" she said, smiling as wide as she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good,\" the visitor said. \"You want to make me happy, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So put your clothes in the bag.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScimeca took off her sweater. It was a heavy knit item with a tight neck. She hauled the hem up and stretched it over her head. Shook it right side out and leaned over and dropped it in the bag. Second layer was a flannel blouse, washed so many times it was soft and shapeless. She unbuttoned it all the way down and pulled the tails out of the waistband of her jeans. Shrugged it off and dropped it in the bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now I\u0027m cold,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe unbuttoned the jeans and undid the zip and pushed them down her legs. Kicked off her shoes and stepped out of the jeans. Rolled the shoes and the jeans together and put them in the bag. Peeled off her socks and shook them out and threw them in, one at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry up, Rita,\" the visitor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScimeca nodded and put her hands behind her back and unhooked her bra. Pulled it off and tossed it in the bag. Slipped her panties down and stepped out of them. Crushed them into a ball and threw them into the bag. The visitor closed the neck of the bag and dropped it on the floor. Scimeca stood there, naked, waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Run the bath,\" the visitor said. \"Make it warm, since you\u0027re cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScimeca bent down and put the stopper in the drain. It was a simple rubber item, secured by a chain. She opened the faucets, three-quarters hot and one-quarter cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open the paint,\" the visitor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScimeca squatted down and picked up the screwdriver. Worked the tip into the crack and levered. Rotated the can under the screwdriver, once, twice, until the lid sucked free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be careful. I don\u0027t want any mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScimeca laid the lid gently on the tile. Looked up, expectant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pour the paint in the tub.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up the can, both hands. It was wide, not easy to hold. She clamped it between her palms and carried it to the tub. Twisted from the waist and tipped it over. The paint was thick. It smelled of ammonia. It ran slowly over the lip of the can and poured into the water. The swirl from the faucets caught it. It eddied into a spiral pattern and sank like a weight. The water started dissolving the edges of the spiral and thin green color drifted through the tub like clouds. She held the can upside down until the thick stream thinned, and then stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Careful,\" the visitor said. \"Now put the can down. And don\u0027t make a mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned the can the right way up and squatted again and placed it gently on the tile next to the lid. It made a hollow, empty sound, damped slightly by the residue coating the metal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now get the stirring stick. Mix it up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked up the stick and knelt at the edge of the tub. Worked the stick into the thick sunken mass and stirred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s mixing,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visitor nodded. \"That\u0027s why you bought latex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe color changed as the paint dissolved. It went from dark olive to the color of grass growing in a damp grove. It thinned, all the way down to the consistency of milk. The visitor watched carefully. It was OK. Not as dramatic as the real thing, but it was dramatic enough to be using paint at all, in the circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK, that\u0027ll do. Put the stick in the can. No mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScimeca pulled the stick out of the green water and shook it carefully. Reached back and stood it upright in the empty can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the screwdriver.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood the screwdriver next to the stick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put the lid back on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picked the lid up by the edge and laid it across the top of the can. It canted up at a shallow angle, because the stirring stick was too tall to let it go all the way down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can turn the faucets off now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned back to the tub and shut off the water. The level was up to within six inches of the rim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you store your carton?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the basement,\" she said. \"But they took it away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visitor nodded. \"I know. But can you remember exactly where it was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScimeca nodded in turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was there for a long time,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to put the can down there,\" the visitor said. \"Right where the carton was. Can you do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScimeca nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I can do that,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised the metal hoop. Eased it up alongside the unsteady lid. Carried the can out in front of her, one hand on the handle, the other palm down against the lid, securing it. She went down the stairs and through the hallway and down to the garage and through to the basement. Stood for a second with her feet on the cold concrete floor, trying to get it exactly right. Then she stepped to her left and placed the can on the floor, in the center of the space the carton had occupied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE TAXI WAS struggling on a long hill past a small shopping center. There was a supermarket, with rows of stores flanking it. A parking lot, mostly empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are we here?\" Harper asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because Scimeca is next,\" Reacher said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe taxi labored onward. Harper shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me who.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think about how,\" Reacher said. \"That\u0027s the absolute final proof.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSCIMECA MOVED THE empty can an inch to the right. Checked carefully. Nodded to herself and turned and ran back upstairs. She felt she ought to hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out of breath?\" the visitor asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScimeca gulped and nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ran,\" she said. \"All the way back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK, take a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe breathed deeply and pushed her hair off her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m OK,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So now you have to get into the tub.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScimeca smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get all green,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" the visitor said. \"You\u0027ll get all green.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScimeca stepped to the side of the tub and raised her foot. Pointed her toe and put it in the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s warm,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visitor nodded. \"That\u0027s good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScimeca took her weight on the foot in the water and brought the other in after it. Stood there in the tub up to her calves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now sit down. Carefully.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put her hands on the rim and lowered herself down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Legs straight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe straightened her legs and her knees disappeared under the green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Arms in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let go of the rim and put her hands down beside her thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good,\" the visitor said. \"Now slide down, slowly and carefully.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shuffled forward in the water. Her knees came up. They were stained green, dark and then pale where little rivulets of paint flowed over her skin. She lay back and felt the warmth moving up her body. She felt it lap over her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Head back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tilted her head and looked up at the ceiling. She felt her hair floating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever eaten oysters?\" the visitor asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. She felt her hair swirl in the water as she moved her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once or twice,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You remember how it feels? They\u0027re in your mouth, and you just suddenly swallow them whole? Just gulp them down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I liked them,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretend your tongue is an oyster,\" the visitor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced sideways, puzzled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to swallow your tongue. I want you to just gulp it down, real sudden, like it was an oyster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if I can do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you try?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, I can try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK, give it a go, right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe concentrated hard, and tried. Gulped it back, suddenly. But nothing happened. Just a noise in her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t work,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Use your finger to help,\" the visitor said. \"The others all had to do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My finger?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe visitor nodded. \"Push it back in there with your finger. It worked for the others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe raised her hand. Thin paint ran off her arm, with thicker globules where the mixing wasn\u0027t perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which finger?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try the middle,\" the visitor said. \"It\u0027s the longest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe extended her middle finger and folded the others. Opened her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put it right under your tongue,\" the visitor said. \"And push back hard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her mouth wider and pushed back hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now swallow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallowed. Then her eyes jammed open in panic. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/running-blind-jack-reacher-4/page-29.html","bookId":2342,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:26 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:26 AM"}
