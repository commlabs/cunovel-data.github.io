{"id":105429,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pay attention to your driving and stop worrying about me,\" he wheezed out of his smashed nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, he was doing so good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes met Clyde\u0027s in the rear view mirror and he smirked. Nice to know the humor was contagious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d left everyone at the dump, it seemed safer. Even with Parker there. Without his zombies. They were long gone, in pieces with my three of the Skopamish. I got a real pang of guilt over that. I hated my zombies getting Actually Dead because of me. Even the gophers having gotten the torch had been wrong on so many levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clinic came into view and I screeched to a stop, parking in the emergent area. The pulse scanner read my license plate, automatically identifying the car, driver and time of day. There was no reporting stuff to the cops later. In this age of All Knowing Pulse Tech. the cops didn\u0027t have to scrounge for domestic violence or any kind of purposeful harm. If you arrived in a car and parked, you were cataloged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got out and jogged around to the other side, where Clyde met me. The police station was located very close to the med clinic, so when Garcia pulled up my first thought wasn\u0027t a good one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, he was suspended so why was he here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh shit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t had the antidote.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps knew immediately and yelled, \"Caleb, watch it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo late, Garcia, who was all but frothing at the mouth like a rabid dog, jumped on me and started whaling on me like there was no tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he didn\u0027t stop, there wouldn\u0027t be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde tore him off and flung him casually against a nearby tree. Garcia plowed into the trunk and cracked his head a good one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up, swaying, feeling like I\u0027d just finished a whole spin cycle inside the washing machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head to clear it. \"Hold him!\" I said, ripping the top of the antidote off with my teeth, I spit it on the concrete sidewalk and strode toward Garcia. Clyde had his arms looped under and through Garcia\u0027s arms, pinning him against his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" he whipped his head from side to side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobbi approached him and his eyes found hers and he started to yell in earnest then, \"Corpse whore! Undead slut!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I bash him around? I could convince him of some reason,\" Clyde said casually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, \"No Clyde. You can open his mouth though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde did, applying bruising force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarcia gagged, \"Argh!\" muffled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Open up,\" Clyde said with a smile like an evil dentist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was enjoying this far too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI applied the drop and Clyde forced Garcia\u0027s mouth closed, the absorption taking seconds. Clyde released Garcia slowly and Bobbi said, \"Well, I guess we know what he really thinks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe, but where did that leave me with Jade? She\u0027d said some stuff too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBad stuff. Things that I hadn\u0027t really known she felt so strongly about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well that was handy, Caleb,\" Gramps croaked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh shit. I\u0027d totally zoned on Gramps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled crookedly at me and I saw he was missing some teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe took him inside the clinic and Jezebel the Organic was there. I bet she was thinking there was something wrong with the Hart family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr just me. I seemed to always be in the mix no matter what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGramps looked at me from the examination table, \"Go Caleb. Your folks need the antidote.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCripes-on-a-crutch, The Parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom was kinda crazy naturally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran to the swinging doors, took one look at a dazed Garcia and launched myself at the Camaro. Clyde opened the door for Gale and she slid into the back seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven with Clyde and Gale I felt alone in the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never felt so lonely, or so determined in my life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dog felt the Boy as he came, his intent as clear as if he had spoken. The Old Alpha had dropped the Dog off at the First Cave in which he had lived with this pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dog thought his coming was quite good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the Alphas in his pack were sick. The Dog did not know with what but the female was greatly affected. The Dog looked at the female Alpha now, muttering about things that made no sense. The Alpha male was playing the game with the ball that they threw into a net with holes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormally, he would play this game with his Boy. But today, the Alpha had been playing from the time the heat was upon the cave until it had almost gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smelled of adrenaline and sweat. The Alpha male smelled of sickness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Alpha female had not been in the food place the entire day. His food dish stood empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dog whined, his tail pinned against his hindquarters. He stood, waiting forlornly by the hole that did not open. Standing watch for the return of his Boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the thing that smelled of not good garbage rolled up outside the cave and his Boy got out, the Dog was not surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dead One and a female who he knew from scent alone ran to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dog wagged his tail for the first time that day. He saw his Boy give the Alpha a look of surprise and exchange a furtive glance with the Dead One.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis Boy was aware of the sickness plaguing the Alphas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would rectify this imbalance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my car door and saw Dad playing basketball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow, this was weird. This was a work day, he should have been long gone into some lab weirdness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the enhancer had changed all that, hadn\u0027t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no. Here he was, almost suppertime and he had been playing ball... it looked like all day. I took in his appearance and he was wearing his pajamas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guessed it he was expendable to the Graysheets, so they\u0027d given my dad the enhancer. He\u0027d done his gig for them. They had the map for humanity, getting me out of the way was critical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if they\u0027d thought that I\u0027d pull a suicide card or some stupid crap like that? Just because everyone I knew lost it? Well, they didn\u0027t know me very well. Sure it would have been... awful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought of Jade systematically going crazy and shuddered. Maybe more than awful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad?\" I said and he turned, his eyes dim and slack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb?\" he said, confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, Dad. I have some medicine for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe backed away, his eyes slid to Clyde. \"What\u0027s he doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat... and here comes the paranoia. Loved the side effects of this shit. I bet it wasn\u0027t FDA approved. Uh-huh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s just hanging out, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not keen on corpses, son,\" he said, trying to enunciate and failing. This enhancer crap must affect the speech area of the brain. When Dad was back on board, he\u0027d let me know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde and I circled him like sharks in blood-infested waters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad was strong but Clyde was stronger and I was determined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe took him down on the three by three meter patch of sanctioned grass and nailed him with a drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom proved to be harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I came to the door, Onyx stood there expectantly and I gave him a soft pat. \"Where\u0027s Mom, boy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whined in response, giving me a half-wag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings didn\u0027t look good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde stood in the open doorway, cradling my six foot-one, two hundred pound Dad against his chest like he was a sack of flour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jerked my head to the couch where a colorful afghan lay bunched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot folded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes scanned the house. It was a wreck. And it didn\u0027t smell. It was devoid of the good food smells that I was used to. The kitchen lay unused and dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Mom popped out of the pantry with a knife, Clyde deposited Dad on the couch, comatose. As Mom flew at Clyde, the silver of the blade glinted as the last of the afternoon light caught it above her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clyde, watch out!\" Gale yelled and Onyx gave a sharp bark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not worry, Dear Heart,\" Clyde said, latching on to Mom\u0027s arm like a snake striking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t have to tell him to be gentle. It was a river of emotion that bound us together, what I felt, he felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was nuts but she was my mom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knife clattered to the floor and Bobbi picked it up, putting it on the breakfast bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom struggled against the force that was Clyde.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt somehow wrong to have my zombie restrain my mom. Some things I think a son shouldn\u0027t have to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike watch their parents go crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUse the dead to save them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeel like killing everyone associated with the Graysheets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sure there would have been clear DI if I\u0027d been tested at that moment, Mom struggling and flailing while Clyde held her still so I could give her the drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGale sat on her legs and I whispered, \"Sorry Mom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer grayish-blue eyes looked into mine and she said in a voice hoarse from shrieking, \"You don\u0027t love me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t true. But in her impaired mental state, it was true to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t listen, Caleb. She doesn\u0027t know what she\u0027s saying,\" Gale said logically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen why did it make me feel like dogshit?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd why did it make me think of Jade?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe put Mom beside Dad on their bed. They slept like the dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot even remotely funny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gulped and bit back a sobbing hiccup, seeing my parents lying there like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde put a hand on my shoulder, his hazel eyes piercing me, feeling the swollen waters of my emotions. \"Some events make future ones clearer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked back at him while I listened to my parents breathing in the background. Finally I responded, \"Much.\" I was disgusted by the choices I had been forced to make. Disgusted by the certainty of ones I\u0027d have to make in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Graysheets had been perfectly right about one thing: I was definitely the threat they\u0027d thought I was. But did the chicken come before the egg? That\u0027s what Gramps would have asked. If they hadn\u0027t put things in motion, would I have responded like I did? We\u0027ll never know. Because they did set those events in motion. And follow-through guy that I was, I finished my part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked out, Onyx racing ahead of us to hop into the Camaro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d sure gotten over his fear of cars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dog saw that his Boy would leave. Casting a furtive glance at the Alphas resting peacefully in their inner sanctum, he shadowed his Boy until he made his way to the foul-thing-which-moved. He loathed the box with its horrible acrid smells but sprinted to it, hoping his Boy would take him. He had a sense that the Old Alpha needed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dog was loyal to his pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis Boy, the Dead One and his female (that is how he thought of the female, as she had that same smell that his Boy and the Dead One had), came to be in the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wagged his tail and assumed an appealing stance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis posture was successful as his Boy slid in beside him, giving him the rough pat that he\u0027d come to love. The Dog knew that his Boy was most pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWag-thunk-wag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade awoke in Brett\u0027s arms and instantly felt awkward. Where was she? She looked around... they were outside the hideaway. Her mind was thick and she felt groggy, like she\u0027d had too much sleep. Jade tried to wrack her brains for what had happened. She saw all her friends were milling around, talking quietly. They looked ragged, like they needed food, sleep and showers, not necessarily in that order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to stand and Brett grunted. \"What?\" she asked, getting upright and straightening. Her head spun and she threw a palm out, touching the fender of a stacked car. The cold metal was a relief. Solid, sure, there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett responded, \"My ribs, they\u0027re busted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade turned to face him, looking up at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGawd, when had everyone grown up? She swallowed the sudden lump that was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she remembered Howie and fear loomed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett saw her face and reached out for her. She allowed her hand to be taken and her Empath vibes came online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe loved her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett loved her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eT-M-effing-I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snatched her hand away and he just stared. Finally, he spread his palms out to the side of this body. \"I don\u0027t have anything to hide, Jade. Ya know what the deal is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied her some more, asking the question that kept them safely out of Mondo Awkward Territory, \"What scared you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Howie?\" she asked in response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrett glanced behind her and she saw a strung out Howie, his mouth duct taped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith cheetah print tape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade\u0027s eyes found Sophie\u0027s and she giggled, shrugging. \"It\u0027s what I had.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat girl carried animal print duct tape? Better question: what girl carried duct tape anyway?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe caught Alex staring and he smirked, waggling his eyebrows and Randi punched him and he laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerv-boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTiff said, \"It\u0027s the shit. On a desert island, that\u0027d be one of the things I\u0027d have for sure.\" Tiff thought about it some more, \"and gum.\" A bubble went off like a bomb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade shook her head, a small smile touching her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she heard a familiar car pull up outside the fence of the Kent Refuse Station and the smile faded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb tore out of the Camaro, his eyes searching the area behind the fence for one person. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-weeps-death-5/page-33.html","bookId":2493,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:07 PM"}
