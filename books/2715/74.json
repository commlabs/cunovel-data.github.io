Still wearing the same tight black T-shirt from the night before, Knox kept his face lowered and took a step forward, until he looked up and saw me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe jerked back into the hallway, and seared Pick with an accusing glance. “What—?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePick lifted his hands, claiming innocence. “She just showed up. I had no idea she was coming by.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gaped at Pick for taking Knox’s side, as if he wouldn’t have let me in if he’d known I was coming over, or if Knox had been here. And why the hell did Knox not want to see me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClenching my teeth as hurt anger filled my veins, I narrowed my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow dare he? How dare he run from me after six years, after I waited for him for most of that time, and missed him, and kept loving him? How dare he not even want to see me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI marched forward, thrusting Julian at his father as I kept my gaze fixed on Knox. “Excuse us a minute.” Grabbing the door, I pulled it shut behind me and closed it in Pick’s face as he scrambled to catch his kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut once I was alone in the hallway with the stranger claiming to be Knox, my anger died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe uncertainty grew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d changed so much. His hair was shaved close; it made his head appear to be shaped different. The beard scruff he sported hid a lot, but I could still tell he’d grown some harder angles to his jaw and cheekbones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough his face had lost some baby fat and grown lean, his body mass had practically doubled. And it was all muscle, pure, steel bulging muscle. They were so freaking big, they seemed to obstruct his mobility until he didn’t move quite as smoothly as he used to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing, absolutely nothing looked the same, except maybe the eyes. I hadn’t gotten a very good look at them in the darkness of the bar last night, but what I’d seen of them then had made them appear black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, in the full light, they were brown again and I could finally recognize some of my Knox, except only the color and shape were the same. They kind of had a dead expression to them now, or maybe severely broken, like something in him was damaged beyond repair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePain deep in my stomach knotted my guts into tight bundles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell had he been through?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy gaze moved back up to his face. “I didn’t recognize you last night,” was all I could think to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt like the stupidest comment in the world, but what else was I supposed to say? Hey, long time no see? I missed you like crazy? I still think about you every day? I can’t seem to stop loving you, no matter how hard I try?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, so not going to happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I noticed,” he said, and God, even his voice was all wrong. There were little hoarse gaps, making it gravelly and deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed, unable to read him at all. He didn’t sound rude...or sweet, for that matter. He was just...indifferent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich killed me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing inside me indifferent about seeing him. I was a disaster. My heart thumped with all kinds of crazy, my palms sweated with nerves, and my arms ached to reach for him, to just...hug him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’d been six years since he’d hugged me, and no one hugged the way Knox Parker hugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was just freaking unbelievable. Knox was standing in front of me, in the flesh, and I couldn’t hug him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, I hear you’ve been out since Wednesday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced away, as if he were disinterested in our conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis response devastated me in multiple ways. But at least he wasn’t running off and hiding anymore. He was still here, letting me look at him, and talk to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last time I’d seen him—excluding last night, which didn’t count because I hadn’t realized who he was—he’d held me desperately close and whispered his love to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d been fully ready to wait his four-year sentence for him. Except that sentence had been extended another thirty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich led to another reason I was crushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How are you free this soon?” He wasn’t supposed to be free this soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze finally lifted to mine, his dark brown eyes bruised with pain. “I don’t know. They let me out on parole, I guess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, but the sound morphed into a sob. But Parole? Parole was causing all this? Why hadn’t I thought of parole?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlapping my hand over my mouth, I bit my lip as hard as I could to quell the tears I could feel forming. When I was able to finally control some of my emotions, I dropped my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, I, uh...” I let out a shaky laugh and brushed the hair out of my face. “I have so many questions.” When he looked away again, my nerves went haywire. “You want to get out of here? Go somewhere to talk?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/worth-it-forbidden-men-6/page-74.html","bookId":2715,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:19 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:36:19 AM"}
