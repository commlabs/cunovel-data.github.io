Shirl must know that Megan would be worrying, wondering. The least she could do was call, and if, for one reason or another, Shirl couldn’t make one lousy phone call, then Rhys should have done it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegan arrived at Shore’s early that night, glad to have an excuse to get out of the house and mingle with people who didn’t have fangs, drink blood, or sleep in coffins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt midnight, force of habit had her glancing at the front door. She shook her head, wondering how long it would take her to stop expecting Rhys to show up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 12:05, he strolled into the store with Shirl on his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegan stared at Shirl. Her friend had always been beautiful but now…Megan shook her head. Impossible as it seemed, Shirl was even more gorgeous than ever. The changes were subtle. Anyone who hadn’t known Shirl before wouldn’t be aware of them, but they were there. Her skin was a little more translucent, a little paler. Her hair was thicker and more lustrous. And she possessed an almost tangible aura of seductive power that hadn’t been there before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was Rhys who held Megan’s gaze. He wore a long-sleeved black silk shirt open over a blood-red T-shirt, and a pair of snug black jeans. He reminded her of a wild jungle cat, lean and lithe. She couldn’t take her eyes off of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Megan!” Shirl hurried toward her, moving with the same fluidity that Megan had noticed in Rhys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling like the ugly duckling welcoming the swan, Megan forced a smile. “Hi.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi?” Shirl repeated with a frown. “Is something wrong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why should anything be wrong?” Megan tried to mask her anger behind a smile, and failed. “Why haven’t you called me? I’ve been worried sick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” Shirl said. “I guess it was thoughtless of me, but…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t matter now.” Megan glanced at Rhys, then back at Shirl, and couldn’t help feeling…what? Jealous? That was ridiculous, and yet, like it or not, she felt like an outsider, as if they had joined an exclusive club to which she could never belong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was relieved when a man entered the shop, breaking the awkward silence between them. “I’m glad you’re all right. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a customer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelief turned to regret as she watched Rhys and Shirl leave the store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Megan got off work that night, Rhys was waiting for her in the parking lot. She couldn’t stifle a rush of pleasure at seeing him standing beside her car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Megan, we need to talk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s Shirl?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. “I sent her back to my place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe folded her arms and lifted her chin. “What do you want to talk about?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You. Me. Us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a tight rein on her tumultuous emotions, she said, “There is no us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heartbeat slammed into overdrive when he took a step toward her. “Isn’t there?” He placed his hand on her breast. “I can feel your heart beating for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be ridiculous!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Am I? Tell me you don’t want me. Say it out loud, and you’ll never see me again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rhys, I don’t need this right now. Please, just go away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Say you don’t want me, and I’m gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right, I want you! Are you happy? But it doesn’t change anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved still closer. Too close. Memories of the times they had made love flashed across her mind. She wished she could go back in time, to the days before she knew what he was, when ignorance had, indeed, been bliss. But there was no going back. No changing what he was, or what he had done to Shirl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlinking back her tears, she turned her back to him and unlocked the car door. “I have to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit, Megan, don’t do this.” He put his hand on the top edge of the door so she couldn’t open it. “At least give us a chance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. “I can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When you found out what I was, I told myself it was for the best, that you were better off without me. That it would never work between us. But now…dammit, Megan, I’m begging you. Stay with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to, but I can’t. I’m afraid. Afraid of what I’ve seen. Afraid of what you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t change that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at him over her shoulder, her eyes brimming with tears. “But you can change me. And that’s what I’m really afraid of.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlacing his hands on her shoulders, he turned her around so she was facing him again. “Would you believe me if I swore that I will never do that to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit!” He raked his hand through his hair. “Megan, what can I do? What can I say to change your mind?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer tears came faster now, rolling unchecked down her cheeks. What did she want? How could she trust him? How could she let him go? He was right. She wanted him. She couldn’t fight him anymore, couldn’t fight the longing of her own heart. With a sigh, she rested her forehead against his chest, felt her tears start again as his arms closed lovingly around her. Right or wrong, for better or worse, this was where she wanted to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlacing a finger beneath her chin, he tilted her head up, then brushed her tears away. “Can I drive you home?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a nod, she handed him the keys to her car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was acutely aware of his nearness on the way home. His presence filled the car, or maybe it was her increased awareness of his power. She had always thought he was just exceptionally handsome, but after seeing the subtle changes in Shirl, she knew the flawless perfection of his face and form were a by-product of being a vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they reached her house, Rhys parked the car in the driveway, then came around to open her door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegan felt suddenly shy as they walked up to the porch. He unlocked the door and followed her inside. She dropped her handbag on the sofa table; he tossed her keys on top, then drew her into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve missed you,” he said quietly. “More than you can imagine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I missed you, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it okay if I kiss you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed softly, amused that he would ask. Taking him by the hand, she led him to the sofa, pulled him down beside her, and kissed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis arms went around her once more, drawing her body against his. With a sigh of contentment, she closed her eyes and leaned into him, hungry for his touch, for his kisses. They could never have a normal life together and she knew it, but it didn’t matter. He was here now, and she intended to savor every moment she could. And when it was over…She shook the thought away. She wouldn’t worry about that now. It felt too good to be in his arms, to feel his body against hers, to hold him and taste him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they parted, Rhys leaned back against the sofa. Utterly breathless, Megan snuggled against him. She glanced at the fireplace, thinking how cozy a fire would be. She sat up, startled, when fire sprang to life in the hearth a moment later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside her, Rhys laughed softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you do that?” Megan asked. It was a silly question. Who else could have done it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You wanted one, didn’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, but…You could have warned me,” she said, resting her head on his shoulder. “What other tricks can you do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dogs do tricks,” he said, sounding offended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, what do you call it, then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s power, my sweet. Vampire power.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And now Shirl has it, too.” It wasn’t a question, but a statement of fact. “I don’t think I want her as a roommate anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s been expecting that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She doesn’t think it’s a good idea, either. She’s not sure she can control herself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So she’s going to stay with you?” Megan didn’t like that arrangement in the least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. She’s going to find her own place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh? How’s she going to pay for it?” Shirl had made good money as a model, but she had never saved any.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s got a job.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How can she model now? She can’t work during the day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She called her agent and told him she’s come down with some rare disease and that her doctor advised her to stay out of the sun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegan frowned. “I thought vampires couldn’t be photographed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was true in the old days, but everything changed with the advent of digital cameras.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess a lot of things have changed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Except the way I feel about you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rhys…what are we doing? This can’t work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, but I can’t seem to stay away from you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then don’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, Megan, you tempt me in so many ways.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Show me,” she whispered. “Show me, show me, show me….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalling back on the sofa, he drew her down on top of him, his mouth claiming hers in a kiss that was gentle and desperate at the same time. She kissed him back with the same intensity, refusing to worry about what the future might hold. They were together now, and that was all that mattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moaned softly when he rolled onto his side, then sat up, drawing her with him. “What’s the matter?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s late. You need to get some sleep, and I need to feed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” His words brought reality crashing down on her. Had he been an ordinary man, she could have fixed him a sandwich, but, in this case, she was the soup de jour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood, then lifted her to her feet. “See me out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a nod, she linked her arm with his and walked him to the door, then stood on tiptoe to kiss him good night. She was tempted to ask him to stay, to make love to her until dawn, but it didn’t seem wise to take a hungry vampire to bed. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everlasting-desire-everlasting-2/page-29.html","bookId":2304,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:10:49 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:10:49 PM"}
