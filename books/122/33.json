Ayounger him, a younger her. They went to Niagara Fallsfor their honeymoon. Had a lovely time. Smiles to prove it.\n\u003cbr\u003e We move back in time. Photos from his student days atUofT: with friends; in front of St. Mike\u0027s; in his room;during Diwali on Gerrard Street; reading at St. Basil\u0027sChurch dressed in a white gown; wearing another kind ofwhite gown in a lab of the zoology department; ongraduation day. A smile every time, but his eyes tellanother story.\n\u003cbr\u003e Photos from Brazil, with plenty of three-toed sloths in situ.\n\u003cbr\u003e With a turn of a page we jump over the Pacific – andthere is next to nothing. He tells me that the camera didclick regularly – on all the usual important occasions – buteverything was lost. What little there is consists of whatwas assembled by Mamaji and mailed over after the events.\n\u003cbr\u003e There is a photo taken at the zoo during the visit of aV.I.P. In black and white another world is revealed to me.\n\u003cbr\u003e The photo is crowded with people. A union cabinet ministeris the focus of attention. There\u0027s a giraffe in thebackground. Near the edge of the group, I recognize ayounger Mr. Adirubasamy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Mamaji?\" I ask, pointing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes,\" he says.\n\u003cbr\u003e There\u0027s a man next to the minister, with hornrimmedglasses and hair very cleanly combed. He looks like aplausible Mr. Patel, face rounder than his sons.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Is this your father?\" I ask.\n\u003cbr\u003e He shakes his head. \"I don\u0027t know who that is.\"There\u0027s a pause of a few seconds. He says, \"It\u0027s myfather who took the picture.\"On the same page there\u0027s another group shot, mostly ofschoolchildren. He taps the photo.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s Richard Parker,\" he says.\n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m amazed. I look closely, trying to extract personalityfrom appearance. Unfortunately, it\u0027s black and white againand a little out of focus. A photo taken in better days,casually. Richard Parker is looking away. He doesn\u0027t evenrealize that his picture is being taken.\n\u003cbr\u003e The opposing page is entirely taken up by a colour photoof the swimming pool of the Aurobindo Ashram. It\u0027s a nicebig outdoor pool with clear, sparkling water, a clean bluebottom and an attached diving pool.\n\u003cbr\u003e The next page features a photo of the front gate of PetitSeminaire school. An arch has the school\u0027s motto painted onit: Nil magnum nisi bonum. No greatness without goodness.\n\u003cbr\u003e And that\u0027s it. An entire childhood memorialized in fournearly irrelevant photographs.\n\u003cbr\u003e He grows sombre. \"The worst of it,\" he says, \"is that Ican hardlyremember what my mother looks like any more. I cansee her in my mind, but it\u0027s fleeting. As soon as I try tohave a good look at her, she fades. It\u0027s the same with hervoice. If I saw her again in the street, it would all comeback. But that\u0027s not likely to happen. It\u0027s very sad not toremember what your mother looks like.\" He closes the book.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1841/53351.html","bookId":122,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 4:22:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 4:22:29 AM"}
