Better yet, why was Blake still on top of me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrowing my elbow back, it connected with his stomach and a grunt followed. “Get off me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled to his feet, eyes sparkling. “You like to hit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scrambled up, glaring. “You need to get out of here. Right now, we don’t need to deal with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good point.” He backed off, his grin fading. “See you later tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever,” I muttered, turning back to where Daemon was walking up the driveway. I trotted out of the woods and over to his side. “Is everything okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon nodded. “Did you hear any of that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I was heading back when I saw him.” I figured if Daemon didn’t know about Blake being all Creepy McCreepsters before we raided Mount Weather, it was a good thing. “Do you believe him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know.” He dropped his arm over my shoulders, steering me toward his house. “Lane has always been a decent guy, but this doesn’t sit well with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wrapped an arm around his waist and leaned into him. “Which part?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All of it—this whole scenario,” he said, sitting down on the step one from the top. He tugged me into his lap, keeping his arms around me. “The fact that the DOD—even Lane—knows damn well that Dawson’s back, and that they have to realize we know they lied. And they’re doing nothing.” He closed his eyes as I pressed my cheek to his. “And what we’re doing tonight—it can work, but it’s so insane. Part of me wonders if they already know we’re coming.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmoothing my thumb along his jaw, I pressed a kiss against his cheek, wishing there was something I could do. “Do you think we’re walking into a trap?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think we’ve been inside the trap the entire time and we’re just waiting for it to spring closed.” He captured my dirty hand in his and held on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA breath shuddered through me. “And we’re going to still do this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe determined set of his shoulders was answer enough. “You don’t have to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Neither do you,” I reasoned softly. “But we both are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon tilted his head back, eyes meeting mine. “That we are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe weren’t doing this because we had a death wish or that we were stupid, but because there were two lives at stake, probably more, that were worth as much as ours. Perhaps this whole endeavor was sacrificial, but if we didn’t go through with it, we’d lose Beth, Chris, and Dawson. Blake was an acceptable loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tendril of panic seized my chest, though. I was scared—frightened out of my mind. Who wouldn’t be? But I’d gotten us to this point and now it was bigger than me, bigger than my fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrawing in a shaky breath, I dipped my head and kissed his lips. “I think I’m going to spend some time with my mom before we leave.” My throat felt thick. “She should be awake soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed me back, his lips lingering. The touch was part yearning with a hint of desperation and acceptance. If things went badly tonight, there really hadn’t been enough time for us. Maybe there’d never be enough time, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, he said in a rough, raw voice, “That’s a good idea, Kitten.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the time came to pile into Daemon’s SUV and start the drive to the Blue Ridge Mountains, the mood was strained. And for once, it really had nothing to do with Blake’s presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were outbursts of laughter and curses, but everyone was on pins and needles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsh was getting into the passenger seat of Matthew’s vehicle. She was decked out in all black—black tights, black sneakers, and a skintight black turtleneck. She looked like a ninja. Next to her, Dee was in pink. Apparently Dee had gotten the memo about staying in the vehicle. Unless Ash planned to blend in with the seat cushions, I wasn’t sure why she was dressed that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than the fact she looked insanely hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, I wore dark sweats and a black thermal that no longer fit Daemon. It must’ve been from his preteen years, because it wouldn’t even fit over his head now, and I looked like I was going to the gym.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was a total fail next to Ash, but Daemon said something about me wearing his clothes that sent blood rushing to every part of my body and I didn’t care if I looked like a hunchback next to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawson and Blake were riding with us, the rest with Matthew. As we pulled out of the driveway, my eyes were glued to my house until it faded out of sight. The few hours I had spent with Mom had been great…really great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first thirty minutes of the trip wasn’t bad. Blake stayed quiet, but when he started talking, things went downhill from there. A few times I thought Daemon was going to stop the vehicle and throttle him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t think Dawson or I would’ve stopped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawson shifted, dropping his head into his hand. “Do you ever stop talking?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When I’m sleeping,” Blake replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And when you’re dead,” Daemon threw back. “You’ll stop talking when you’re dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake’s lips thinned. “Point taken.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.” Daemon focused on the road. “Try shutting up for a while.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hid my smile as I twisted around. “What are you going to do when you see Beth?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAwe crept across Dawson’s features, and he shook his head slowly. “Oh, man, I don’t know. Breathe—I’ll finally be able to breathe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoved to tears, I gave him a watery smile. “I’m sure she’ll feel the same way.” At least, I hoped so. The last time I had seen Beth, she wasn’t all there in the head. But if I knew anything about Dawson, I knew he could handle it, because he loved her—he had my mom and dad’s kind of love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of the corner of my eyes, I saw Daemon’s lips tip up at the corners. Something deep in my chest fluttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSucking in a soft breath, I focused on Blake. The side of his head was against the window as he stared out into the dark night. “What about you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze slid to mine. For several seconds, he didn’t answer. “We’ll leave here and head west. And the first thing we’re going to do is go surfing. He really used to dig the sea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned around, staring at my hands. Sometimes it was hard to hate without feeling sorry. And I did feel sorry for his friend. I even felt sorry for Blake. “That’s…that’s good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of us spoke after that, and at first, the mood was somber and heavy with memories and probably a thousand what ifs and a dozen scenarios of what tonight would be like for Dawson and Blake, but as we passed Winchester and crossed over the river and could see the darker shades of the Blue Ridge up ahead, the mood shifted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boys were tense, throwing off testosterone in buckets. Antsy and ready to just do this, I glanced at the time. Twenty till nine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How much longer?” Dawson asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ve got time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe SUV slipped into a lower gear as we started up the mountain. Behind us, Matthew followed closely. He knew the directions. The access road was supposedly about a half a mile before the main entrance. Daemon had typed it into his GPS, but it pretty much spewed the request back out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cell phone dinged and Blake pulled out his cell. “It’s from Luc. He wants to make sure we’re on schedule.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are,” Daemon answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brother popped between the front seats. “Are we sure?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon rolled his eyes. “Yes. I’m sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just checking,” Dawson grumbled, sitting back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Blake was between the seats. “All right, Luc’s ready to do this. He wanted to remind us we’ve only got fifteen minutes. Anything goes wrong, we get out and try again later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want to try again later,” Dawson protested. “Once we get in, we’ve got to keep going.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake frowned. “I want to get them out just as badly as you, man, but we have a limited gap of time. That’s all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We stick to the plan.” Daemon’s gaze met his brother’s in the window. “That’s it, Dawson. I’m not losing you again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing’s going to go wrong, anyway,” I interjected before it turned into a royal rumble in the car. “Everything will go as planned.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI focused on the road. The highway was four lanes and heavy trees crowded the roads on the south and north lanes. It was a blur of shadows. I had no idea how Daemon would find this road, but he started to slow down and merged into the left lane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePressure settled on my chest as he turned onto a barely visible road. There were no markings—nothing signaling that there was even a road there. Two headlights followed us up the narrow opening that was more dirt and gravel than pavement. About two hundred feet in, under the pale moonlight, an old farmhouse sat to the right. Half the roof was missing. Weeds choked the front and sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Creepy,” I murmured. “I bet your ghost guys would say this place is haunted.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon chuckled. “They say every place is haunted. That’s why I love them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ain’t that the truth,” Dawson said as we parked and Matthew pulled in beside us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth cars killed the lights and engines and with no other source of light, it was black as oil. My stomach pitched. Five till nine. There was no backing out now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlake’s cell went off again. “He’s just making sure we’re ready.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God, he’s an annoying little kid,” Daemon muttered, facing where Matthew parked. “We’re getting ready to do this. Andrew?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slipped out, murmuring something to Dee and his sister. Then he turned, throwing up what I’d swear were gang signals. “I’m ready steady.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Geez,” Blake muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We stick to the plan. At no time do any of us”—Daemon directed this at his brother—“deviate from the plan. All of us are coming back tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were murmurs of agreement. With my pulse racing into cardiac arrest territory, I opened the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDaemon placed his hand on my arm. “Stick close to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy vocal chords seemed to have stopped working, so I nodded. Then the four of us were out of the car, breathing in the chilled mountain air. Everything was dark—with slices of moonlight cutting across the access road. I was probably standing next to a bear and had no idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved around the front of the vehicle and stood next to Daemon. Another moved beside me and I realized it was Blake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Time,” Daemon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a quick flash of cell phone light, and Blake said, “One minute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drew in a shallow gasp, but it got stuck. I could feel my heartbeat in every part of my body. Out of the darkness, Daemon found my hand and squeezed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can do this, I told myself. We can do this. We will do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thirty seconds,” Blake said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/opal-lux-3/page-30.html","bookId":1663,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:38 PM"}
