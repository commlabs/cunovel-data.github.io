Dodd sighed softly and got up from the single chair. \"I\u0027m not anxious for a party,\" he said. \"All I want to do is go to sleep.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"At nine o\u0027clock?\" Albin shook his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Maybe I\u0027m tired.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re not tired,\" Albin said. \"You\u0027re scared. You\u0027re scared of what you might find out there in the cold, cruel world, friend. You\u0027re scared of parties and strange people and noise. You want to be left alone to brood, right?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, I—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But I\u0027m not going to leave you alone to brood,\" Albin said. \"Because I\u0027m your friend. And brooding isn\u0027t good for you. It\u0027s brooding that\u0027s got you into such a state—where you worry about growing things, for God\u0027s sake, and about freedom and silly things like that.\" Albin grinned. \"What you\u0027ve got to do is stop worrying, and I know how to get you to do that, kiddo. I really do.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sure you do,\" Dodd said, and his voice began to rise. He went to the bed, walked along its length to the window, as he talked, never facing Albin. \"You know how to make me feel just fine, no worries at all, no complications, just a nice, simple life. With nothing at all in it, Albin. Nothing at all.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now, come on—\" Albin began.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Nothing,\" Dodd said. \"Go to parties, drink, meet a girl, forget, go right on forgetting, and then one day you wake up and it\u0027s over and what have you got?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Parties,\" Albin said. \"Girls. Drinks. What else is there?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A lot,\" Dodd said. \"I want—oh, God, I don\u0027t know what I want. Too much. Too many ideas ... trapped here being a master, and that\u0027s no good.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Dodd,\" Albin said, in what was almost a worried tone, \"what the hell are you talking about?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Being a master,\" Dodd said. \"There shouldn\u0027t be masters. Or slaves. Just—beings, able to do what they want to do ... what makes me any better than the Alberts, anyhow?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The Belbis beam, for one thing,\" Albin said. \"Position, power, protection, punishment. What makes anybody better than anybody else?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But that\u0027s the point—don\u0027t you see?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Albin stood upright, massaging his arm. \"What I see is a case of worry,\" he said, \"and as a doctor I have certain responsibilities. I\u0027ve got to take care of that case of worries, and I\u0027m not going to take no for an answer.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Leave me alone,\" Dodd said. \"Just do me a favor. Leave me alone.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Come with me,\" Albin said. \"This once. Look—what can you lose? Just once can\u0027t hurt you—you can do all the brooding you want to do some other time. Give me a present. Come to the party with me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t like parties.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And I don\u0027t like going alone,\" Albin said. \"So do me a favor.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where is it?\" Dodd asked after a second.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Albin beamed. \"Psych division,\" he said. \"Come on.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The metal door was festooned with paper drapery in red and blue. Dodd turned before they got to it, standing about five feet down the corridor. \"How did you find out about a party in Psych division?\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Albin shrugged. \"I\u0027m an active type,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve got friends all over. You\u0027d be surprised how many friends a man can have, Dodd, if he goes to parties. If he meets people instead of brooding.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"All right,\" Dodd said. \"I\u0027m here, aren\u0027t I? You\u0027ve convinced me—stop the propaganda.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sure.\" Albin went up to the door and knocked. From inside they could hear a dim babel of voices. After a second he knocked again, more loudly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A voice rose above the hum. \"Who\u0027s there?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A friend,\" Albin said. \"The password is Haenlingen-on-fire.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The voice broke into laughter. \"Oh,\" it said. It was now distinguishingly a female voice. \"It\u0027s you, Cendar. But hold it down on the Haenlingen stuff: she\u0027s supposed to be arriving.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"At a party?\" Albin said. \"She\u0027s a hundred and twelve—older than that. What does she want with parties? Don\u0027t be silly.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The door opened. A slim, blonde girl stood by it, her mouth still grinning. \"Cendar, I mean it,\" she said. \"You watch out. One of these days you\u0027re going to get into trouble.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Behind her the hum had risen to a chorus of mad clatter, conversation, laughter, song—the girl dragged Albin and Dodd inside and shut the door. \"I\u0027m always in trouble,\" Albin was saying. \"It keeps life interesting.\" But it was hard to hear him, hard to hear any single voice in the swell of noise.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank God for soundproofing,\" the girl said. \"We can do whatever we like and there\u0027s no noise out there.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The drapes give you away,\" Albin said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Let the drapes give us away,\" the girl said. \"We\u0027re entitled to have quiet little gatherings, right? And who knows what goes on behind the drapes?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Right,\" Albin said. \"You are right. You are absolutely, incredibly, stunningly right. And to prove how right you are I\u0027m going to do you a favor.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What kind of favor?\" the girl said with mock suspicion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Greta,\" Albin said, \"I\u0027m going to introduce you to a nice young man.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You don\u0027t know any nice young men.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I know this one,\" Albin said. \"Greta Forzane, Johnny Dodd. Take good care of him, kiddo—he needs it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What do you mean, good care of him?\" she said. But Albin was gone, into the main body of the party, a melee confused enough so that he was lost in twenty steps. Greta turned back almost hopeless eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A second passed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You a friend of Cendar\u0027s?\" Greta asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Johnny blinked and came back to her. \"Oh, Albin?\" he said. \"We\u0027re—acquaintances.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Friends,\" Greta said firmly. \"That\u0027s nice. He\u0027s such a nice guy—I bet you are, too.\" She smiled and took his arm. Her hand was slightly warm and very dry. Johnny took his first real look at her: she seemed shining, somehow, as if the hair had been lacquered, the face sprayed with a clear polish. The picture she made was vaguely unpleasant, and a little threatening.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A nice guy?\" he said. \"I wouldn\u0027t know, Miss Forzane.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, come on, now,\" she said. \"The name is Greta. And you\u0027re Johnny—right?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \" ... Right.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You know,\" Greta said, \"you\u0027re cute.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Behind her the party was still going on, but its volume seemed to have diminished a little. Or maybe, Johnny thought, he was getting used to it. \"You\u0027re cute too,\" he said awkwardly, not knowing any more what he did want to do, or where he wanted to be. Her grasp on his arm was the main fact in the world.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thanks,\" she said. \"Here.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And as suddenly as that she was in his arms, plastered up against him, pressed to him as tightly as he could imagine, her mouth on his, her hands locked behind his neck: he was choking, he couldn\u0027t breathe, he couldn\u0027t move....\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The door behind him opened and shoved him gently across his back.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He fell, and he fell on top of her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It seemed as if the entire party had stopped to watch him. There was no noise. There was no sound at all. He climbed to his feet to face the eyes and found they were not on him, but behind him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A tiny white-haired woman stood there, her mouth one thin line of disapproval. \"Well,\" she said. \"Having a good time?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In Dodd\u0027s mind, then and later, the sign began.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That was, as far as he could ever remember, the first second he had even seen it. It was there, behind his eyes, blinking on and off, like a neon sign. Sometimes he paid no attention to it, but it was always there, always telling him the same thing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This is the end.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This is the end.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This is the end.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He looked into that ancient grim face and the sign began. And from then on it never stopped, never stopped at all—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Until, of course, the end.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PUBLIC OPINION ONE\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Being an excerpt from a speech delivered by Grigor Pellasin (Citizen, white male, age forty-seven, two arrests for Disorderly Conduct, occupation variable, residence variable) in the district of Hyde Park, city of London, country of England, planet Earth of the Confederation, in the year of the Confederation two hundred and ten, on May fourteenth, from two-thirty-seven P. M. (Greenwich) until three-forty-six P. M. (Greenwich), no serious incidents reported.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They all talk about equality, friends, and you know what equality is? Equality is a license to rob you blind and steal you blind, to cut you up and leave the pieces for the garbage collector, to stuff what\u0027s left of you down an oubliette, friend, and forget about you. That\u0027s what equality is, friends, and don\u0027t you let them tell you any different.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Why, years ago there used to be servants, people who did what you told them. And the servants got liberated, friends, they all got freedom and equality so they were just like us. Maybe you can remember about those servants, because they\u0027re all in the history books, and the historical novels, and maybe you do a little light reading now and then, am I right about that?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Well, sir, those servants got themselves liberated, and do you think they liked it? Do you think they liked being free and equal?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Oh, don\u0027t ask the government, friends, because the government is going to tell you they liked it just fine, going to tell you they loved it being just like everybody else, free and equal and liberated at last.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The government\u0027s going to tell you a lot of things, and my advice is, friends, my advice is do some looking and listening for yourself and think it all out to the right conclusions. Otherwise you\u0027re just letting the government do all your thinking for you and that\u0027s something you don\u0027t want.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e No, friends, you do your own thinking and you figure out whether they liked being free, these servants.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e You know what being free meant for them?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It meant being out of work.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And how do you think they liked that?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now, maybe here among us today, among you kind people listening to what I\u0027ve got to say to you, maybe there are one or two who\u0027ve been out of work during their lifetimes. Am I right? Well, friends, you tell the others here what it felt like.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It felt hopeless and dragged-out and like something you\u0027d never want to go through again, am I right?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Of course I\u0027m right, friends. But there was nothing you could do about being out of work. If you were out of work that was that, and you were through, no chance, no place to move.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e These servants, friends, they liked being servants. I know that\u0027s hard to believe because everybody\u0027s been telling you different all your lives, but you just do a little independent thinking, the way I have, and you\u0027ll see. It was a good job, being a servant. It was steady and dependable and you knew where you stood.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Better than being out of work? You bet your last credit, you bet your very last ounce of bounce on that, friends.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And better than a lot of other things, too. They were safe and warm and happy, and they felt fine.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And then a lot of busybodies came along and liberated them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Well, friends, some of them went right back and asked to be servants again—they did so. It\u0027s a historical fact. But that was no good: the machines had taken over and there was no room for them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They were liberated for good.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And the lesson you learn from that, friends, is just this: don\u0027t go around liberating people until you know what they want. Maybe they\u0027re happier the way they are.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now, out on a far planet there\u0027s a strange race. Maybe you\u0027ve heard about them, because they work for us, they help get us the metals we need to keep going. They\u0027re part of the big line of supply that keeps us all alive, you and me both.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And there are some people talking about liberating those creatures, too, which aren\u0027t even human beings. They\u0027re green and they got one eye apiece, and they don\u0027t talk English except a little, or any Confederation tongue.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Yet even so there are people who want to liberate those creatures.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now, you sit back and think a minute. Do those creatures want to be liberated? Is it like liberating you and me, who know what\u0027s what and can think and make decisions? Because being free and equal means voting and everything else. Do you want these green creatures voting in the same assemblies as yours?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e If it were cruel to keep them the way they are, working on their own world and being fed and kept warm and safe, why, I\u0027d say go ahead and liberate them. But what\u0027s cruel about it, friends?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They\u0027re safe—safer than they would be on their own.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They\u0027re fed well and kept warm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And remember those servants, friends. Maybe the greenies like their life, too. It\u0027s their world and their metal—they have a right to help send it along.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e You don\u0027t want to act hastily, friends, now do you?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e My advice to you is this: just let the greenies alone. Just let them be, the way they want to be, and don\u0027t go messing around where there\u0027s no need to mess around. Because if anybody starts to do that, why, it can lead to trouble, friends, to a whole lot of unnecessary bother and trouble.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Am I right?\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2155/60921.html","bookId":446,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 6:18:36 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 6:18:36 AM"}
