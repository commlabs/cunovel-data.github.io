(2)","content":"\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing laughed, “That is because the two of you underestimate your husband’s abilities. Do you have any idea how many powerhouses from the Blood Red Hell we dealt with the other day?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith regards to the head-on confrontation with the people from the Blood Red Hell the other day, although he had described the matter to everyone he hadn’t given a specific headcount. Of course, at that time he himself didn’t know the exact numbers either, but he was able to guess. He was afraid that his significant others would worry, hence he did not say anything. After the battle began, the Heavenly Jewel Masters below the Heavenly King Stage hadn’t been able to get close to the intimidating energy ripples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There were four Heavenly Emperors that came from Blood Red Hell, with the lowest ranked among them a Mid Level Heaven Emperor. The other two were Peak Heavenly Emperors. Apart from them, there were also eight Heavenly Kings and a few Heavenly Zong opponents.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You saw the end result too - we won a complete victory, and the key to the success was your husband, me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon hearing the headcount of the Blood Red Hell opponents, the two women were in a daze. Even though they had a rough idea as to how strong their foes had been, they never expected Blood Red Hell to have that many people with them. Zhou Weiqing and the rest had won the battle, after all, hence they assumed that the enemies probably had not been too strong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing smiled and said, “It was after that battle that I reached the Heavenly Emperor stage. To be honest, if I were to face a Heavenly God opponent, I might not necessarily lose. Why would I be unable to subdue Heavenly Demon Sect?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Xue’er shook her head slowly; the shock in her eyes was gradually replaced with a puzzled look. Not too long ago, Zhou Weiqing was still a nobody, while she was the successor to the number one Saint Land. The difference in their status was extremely huge. Just within the short period of a few years, he managed to gain the ability to establish a Saint Land. The huge difference truly left her completely shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had to look up at the current Zhou Weiqing, who could contend against mighty Heavenly God opponents. Indeed! A person like him definitely had the qualifications to establish a Saint Land. Furthermore, this Saint Land of his would not be weak.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if one disregarded the number of Jewel Masters at the Sixth Jewel cultivation or higher that Peerless Battalion had, they still had a lot of strong powerhouses with them, such as their three great Heavenly Emperors - Zhou Weiqing, the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor and the Demonic Emperor, not forgetting the six Heavenly Kings from the Heavenly Demon Sect, Bing’er who was about to become a Heavenly King, as well as Duan Tianlang, the God Tier Heavenly King. One could say that Zhou Weiqing’s Peerless Sect had already met all the requirements needed to establish a Saint Land. Additionally, he had the support of the Heavenly Bow Empire, which had just expanded its territory to twice its original size. He could mobilize hundreds of thousands of soldiers whenever he wished. The current Zhou Weiqing had, without anyone realizing it, become one of the strongest powerhouses in the Mainland.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Fei’er was not as shy as Shangguan Xue’er - she placed both arms around Zhou Weiqing’s neck and said, “Little Fatty, never did I expect you to become so powerful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing stroked her face gently, “Fei’er, you’ve had it pretty tough for the past few years. Don’t worry, I will definitely make it up to you guys from now on. From today onwards, I will not leave you guys without a very good reason. Over the past few years, I’ve been working very hard as well. During the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands that will be held in half a year’s time, it will be Peerless Sect’s time to shine. It’s up to you guys to decide whether you want to remain in Heaven’s Expanse Palace or join my Peerless Sect - I wouldn’t mind either way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Fei\u0027er chuckled and said without hesitation, “Of course I’ll join the Peerless Sect. After all, I’m the wife of the Sect Leader. Additionally, I want to be the chief instructor of the Peerless Sect. How about that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing laughed and said, “Of course.” As he replied Shangguan Fei’er, he looked to Shangguan Xue’er.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Xue’er understood his intention and sighed softly, “You had already won me over from my uncle. Do you even need to ask?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing let go of Shangguan Fei’er and walked up to Shangguan Xue’er before embracing her, “Of course I have to ask, because I will never force you to do anything against your will. Even if you want to become the Palace Master of Heaven’s Expanse Palace, I will also support you fully. However, if that is the case, within ten years, I will definitely lead the Peerless Sect to assimilate the Heaven’s Expanse Palace in order for you to return to my side.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing’s last sentence was filled with arrogance. Shangguan Xue’er and Fei’er could sense an extremely strong and forceful aura emitting from his body. Such an aura was not coercive in nature; it was just overwhelmingly powerful. They would not doubt the validity of his statement.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Xue’er trembled slightly and glared at him hard, “Doesn’t this count as forcing me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing laughed cheekily, “It’s not the same. My main concern right now is, when will the both of you consummate your marriage with me?! Why not let’s do it together?”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Screw you.” The two women lifted their foot up at the same time and sent a certain someone flying kicks.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight at this moment, strong energy ripples could be felt in the sky. The three of them looked up at the same time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn intense silvery white light that was mixed with faint green light rushed towards Shangguan Bing’er; vaguely, a halo emitted from the center of her chest.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe color of the halo was very strange - its center was silvery white, but it was green on the outside, similar to Zhou Weiqing’s original King Tier Astral Saint Core Nucleus. Wind Attribute Heavenly Energy surrounded the Saint Core Nucleus instead of Saint Energy. The Wind Attribute Heavenly Energy was also mixed with a silvery white halo. It looked very beautiful. In the center of the Saint Nucleus Core, there was also a faint golden light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Success.” Zhou Weiqing leapt into the air and stood a hundred meters away from Shangguan Bing’er. He did not get too close to her out of fear that his aura would affect the last bit of her absorption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout a doubt, Shangguan Bing’er had become a Heavenly King.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing silently sensed the energy ripple radiating from Shangguan Bing’er’s body. Based on his cultivation base as well as familiarity with Saint Energy, he immediately knew what was happening.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a full 15 minutes, Bing’er who was still hovering in the air slowly opened both eyes. A faint greenish silvery light could be seen gleaming in her captivating eyes. At that moment, she looked like a graceful fairy. It was as though she had merged with the air, soaring freely in the sky.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept the wings behind her. Her body swayed gently before falling into Zhou Weiqing’s arms, her heart filled with excitement.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little Fatty, I have succeeded, I have succeeded. I have ascended as well!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing put his arm around her, and pecked her on the forehead, “Congratulations, Bing’er.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of them descended to the ground and landed next to Xue’er and Fei’er. Feeling shy, Bing’er hurriedly released herself from Zhou Weiqing’s embrace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Little Fatty, my Heavenly Core Nucleus seems to be rather strange. I seem to have the ability to merge with the air. What’s happening?” Even though Shangguan Bing’er had already succeeded in condensing her Heavenly Core Nucleus, she somehow felt that she did not fully understand it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing laughed, “Technically, it should not be called a Heavenly Core Nucleus, but a Saint Core Nucleus instead. Nonetheless, it is not quite as pure as the real Saint Core Nucleus. You don’t have any Saint Attribute within your body - you depended on the Saint Energy that I channeled into your body. However, your own attribute was not repressed, hence the Saint Core Nucleus that you have is an amalgamation of the Wind and Saint Energy. As such, your Wind Attribute is no longer the conventional one; rather, it is one that is fused with Creation Energy. To put it simply, your Wind Attribute will not be subdued by the Blood Red Hell’s Destruction Attribute. Furthermore, the range and power of your Wind Attribute would also be greater than an ordinary Wind Attribute Heavenly King. As for how to use it, you have to take some time to explore it on your own. Even though it is not a true Saint Core Nucleus, it still possesses some characteristics of one, something like a sub-Saint Core Nucleus. As it combined with your Wind Attribute, we can call it Windsoul Saint Core Nucleus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Bing’er nodded her head with a gentle smile on her face.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Xue’er and Shangguan Fei’er both felt envious. Shangguan Fei’er moved closer to Zhou Weiqing, grabbed his right arm and shook it hard, “I don’t care, I am going to become a Heavenly King too, you must help me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Xue’er burst out laughing. The cold look on her face shifted into a warm smile, “Silly girl, do you know what a Heavenly King represents? Do you think you can become one that easily?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing chuckled, “Even though it doesn’t come that easily, we’re all one family. Breaking through to the Heavenly King Stage is not that hard. I know of the easiest way for you guys to become a Heavenly King in the shortest time possible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moment he finished his sentence, both Fei’er and Xue’er’s interest was piqued. They blinked their big eyes at him, filled with hopes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing replied solemnly, “It is a very simple method. As long as you sleep with me, you will attain a breakthrough immediately.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Screw you.” Shangguan Fei’er pushed him hard. Unfortunately, Zhou Weiqing was no longer the same pushover Little Fatty Zhou that he used to be. He stood firmly on the ground, not budging even an inch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Xue’er stared at him with a look of disgust, “Your mind is only filled with dirty thoughts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing wore an innocent look on his face and said, “What do you mean dirty thoughts? You can ask Bing’er whether or not I’m telling the truth when I say that you can advance to the next cultivation base by sleeping with me. Also, I am now a Heavenly Emperor. If I really focus my attention while doing the deed, I can inject the essence of my Saint Energy directly into your bodies. Under the exchange of our Yin and Yang, you really would be able to make a breakthrough. I am not lying. Why don’t you give it a try? If it fails, I will accept any punishment from you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Shangguan Fei’er could open her mouth to agree, Shangguan Xue’er had already pulled her over and said in a low voice, “We can’t just ‘try’! If we go for it, he’ll have taken advantage of us!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShangguan Fei\u0027er snapped out of it and realized what was going on as well. She looked resentfully at Zhou Weiqing and threw him a few punches.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhou Weiqing said helplessly, “Well, then you can’t blame me for not helping you out. How about this? I’ll demonstrate it for you with Little Witch first, and when you guys witness the results, we can repeat them. Hehe.”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-27-chapter-274-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-27-chapter-274-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-27-chapter-274-02","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:14 AM"}
