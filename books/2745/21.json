He has on a black, long-sleeved t-shirt, with his dark jeans and work boots. We’re meeting up with everyone at the bar to play a few games of pool. November and Asher are even meeting us there. Asher’s parents, Susan and James, are watching July for the night so that we can all hang out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, just give me, like, fifteen minutes. I need to get my clothes on.” His arms wrap around me, his mouth nuzzling my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tomorrow, I’m taking you somewhere,” he says against the skin of my neck. I tilt my head, giving him more room, my eyes closing against the feeling his mouth creates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where?” I breathe deep, trying to prevent the moan from climbing up my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll see when we get there.” He smiles, his eyes meeting mine in the mirror. He looks so happy that I wonder what he’s up to. “Now, let’s go before I pull down those tiny shorts you’ve got on, and slide into your pussy, making you watch in the mirror while I fuck you.” I bite my lip, thinking that I wouldn’t mind at all if he wanted to do that. In fact, I would be perfectly happy with that option. He starts laughing, his fingers digging into my hips. “Later, I’m going to fuck you right here. I will be hard all night thinking about the things I’m going to do to you while you watch.” He turns me around, taking my hand and placing it over his very hard, very large erection that is pushing the limits of his zipper. My breathing picks up. I can feel the rapid pulse in my clit. “Later,” he says against my mouth, before I feel his tongue against mine. The kiss is so hot that I don’t want to go anywhere; I want him now. He takes my arms from around his neck, kisses my forehead, and leaves the bathroom. “Come on, baby. We gotta go; get a move on,” he yells from somewhere in the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hold your horses; I’m coming!” I yell back, going into the bedroom to pull on my jeans and a cardigan. All the while, thinking about where he may be taking me tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, look who it is,” Jen says, with Britney and Cindy standing on each side of her. I ignore them and walk to the sink to wash my hands. “Look I\u0027m going to be a friend an—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, great.” I roll my eyes, cutting her off before she can say anything else. I look at the three of them in the mirror, my eyes landing on Jen. “I had a feeling we couldn’t just skip this part.” I look over my shoulder at all three of the girls standing there. “I knew this was coming at some point tonight; I just didn’t know when,” I say. Since we got to the bar, Jen has been trying to get Trevor’s attention. She took off her sweater, leaving her in a white tank top and a very-apparent red lace bra. She walked by the table a few times, and then tried flirting with Cash. This didn’t work, I guess. Cash has been seeing some girl he met when he and Trevor went to Alabama. He has been spending most of his free time there with her. Then she tried to talk to Nico, who promptly told her that he didn’t want to fuck her, so she should move on. Now, this. I knew it was coming; I just didn’t know when.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you talking about?” Jen asks, looking confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know, the part that’s in every movie and every book ever written; the one where you tell me that Trevor doesn’t care about me, and is only using me for sex…blah, blah, blah.” I narrow my eyes at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s true; he doesn’t care about you.” She flips her long red hair over her shoulder. “I\u0027m just trying to save you the heartache.” She pouts out her bottom lip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Awww, that so sweet. But I think I’ll stick around for a while. I mean, Lord, the things that man can do in bed are mind blowing. There’s this trick he does, when he’s going to—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You bitch! Stay away from him,” Jen yells, taking a step towards me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should tell Trevor to stay away from me,” I smirk. I know she has tried to do that before and got shut down in front of all of her friends. I hate when women act desperate when it comes to men who don’t want them. Sadly, Jen is beautiful and could probably get any man she wanted if she wasn’t a whack job, as Trevor so eloquently put it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m telling—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You okay, baby?” Trevor asks, sticking his head into the bathroom. Nico pushes the door open all the way, stepping inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck yeah! Party in the bathroom!” Nico yells, making me laugh. I look at Jen, who is trying to kill me with her eyes. Trevor leans in, grabbing my hand pulling me out into the hall, where he presses me against the wall, trapping me with his weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You good?” he asks, leaning in so that his mouth is next to my ear. I can’t focus when his body is pressed so tightly against mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m okay,” I tell him, looking over his shoulder at Jen, who is walking out of the bathroom. Her eyes meet mine, and I know she’s not done with whatever evil plan she’s cooking up. “You’re right; she is a bitch,” I tell Trevor, making him laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If she fucks with you again, tell me. I knew she was up to something when I saw her and her posse walking into the bathroom after you left the table.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She said she wanted to give me some friendly advice, and that I should stay away from you,” I tell him matter-of-factly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was nice of her.” Trevor smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. But I told her that I couldn’t break up with you yet because you’re good in bed. Then I was going to tell her about the thing you do with your tongue when you’re going down on me, but you showed up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry to have ruined your shining moment,” he laughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should be sorry.” I push at his chest. “I was going to verbally kick her ass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Poor baby.” He laughs harder, kissing the side of my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When we get home, I’ll rub your ego to make up for the interruption.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure you will,” I smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabs my face, holding it between his hands. “I love you. Don’t ever doubt that you’re the best thing that has ever happened to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do not make me cry in the middle of the bar, Trevor Earl Mayson.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks up, his eyes bugging out. “Your mom told me,” I shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you ever tell anyone my middle name, I will spank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh! So scary, Earl,” I laugh, ducking under his arm and running away from him. Before I can get too far, he has me up and over his shoulder. His hand lands on my ass with a loud smack, making me laugh harder. “You put me down right now, Ea—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I can get the words out, I’m flipped, and his mouth is covering mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulls his mouth from mine, leaving me breathless. “Now, behave yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile up at him, and when I glance around the bar, I notice that Jen and her crew had been watching our little spectacle. I smirk at them and toss my hair over my shoulder. What I really want to do is yell ha ha he’s mine and stick out my tongue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine,” I say, walking back to the table, noticing that November is drinking cranberry juice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, are you okay?” I ask her, looking down at the glass in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh yeah. I’m fine. I just don’t feel like drinking.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t feel like drinking?” I ask, surprised. She always drinks beer when we’re out, except when she was—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re pregnant.” Asher says proudly, puffing out his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my God! Congrats!” I hug November, and then stand to hug Asher. “When did you find out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This morning.” Asher puts his arm around her, kissing her nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When do you find out what you’re having?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not for a few weeks,” November says, rubbing her belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a boy,” Asher says, his hand moving to her waist. Trevor starts laughing, along with Cash and Nico. “I made sure to do it on the right side,” Asher says deadpan, glaring at his brothers. I start laughing so hard that tears slide down my cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We know, honey,” November says, patting Asher’s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, whatever it ends up being, congrats, guys. That’s awesome,” Trevor says, hugging November, and then patting his brother on the back. When Trevor looks at me, he smiles, making a knot form in my stomach. The look in his eyes says a lot more than I want to hear. I try to shake myself out of the feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s so exciting,” I cry, clapping my hands. “Let’s have a drink. I mean, you can’t drink because you’re, you know, but I—um—I’ll be back,” I sputter out, needing to get away from Trevor and the look on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you okay?” Nico asks, leaning on the bar next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” I say, signaling the bartender. When she finally gets to me, I ask for a shot of tequila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tequila?” Nico asks, his eyebrows drawn together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep.” I tip the shot back without salt or lime, then tap the glass, signaling for a refill. I start to lift it to my mouth, when it’s taken from my hand from over my shoulder, and given to Nico. “That’s mine.” I pout as Nico takes my shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re going home,” Trevor says, wrapping an arm around my waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I’m spending time with everyone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were, then you ran off; now we’re going home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can you not be a jerk?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have plans tomorrow morning, so we need to leave anyways.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can have Nico drop me off at home if you’re leaving,” I suggest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, you can’t have Nico drop you off at home,” Nico says, laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine.” I walk back to the table, grabbing my purse. “I guess we’re leaving,” I tell November, who looks at my face, then at Trevor, and starts laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s fine. We need to leave as well,” November says, getting off her barstool. “But we will see you this weekend for the party, right?” she asks, looking at me, and I have no idea what she’s talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What party?” I ask, then look around when I notice that everyone has gotten quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, it’s not a party; it’s a—um—Bar-B-Que,” Asher says, cutting in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll be there,” Trevor says, glaring at everyone before pulling me out the door behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t know we were going to a Bar-B-Que this weekend,” I tell him, as he lifts me up into the truck and buckles me in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It slipped my mind,” he tells me, kissing my forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” I say, laying my head on his shoulder, relaxing into his side once he starts the truck. The tequila is making me feel all warm and fuzzy. I’m such a lightweight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why is it that every time someone talks about kids, you panic?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit up; I knew this day was coming. “I told you before, I don’t want kids.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want kids, Liz, and I know that you do too. I see the longing in your face anytime you hold July, or even when you met Kara and noticed she was pregnant.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/until-trevor-until-2/page-21.html","bookId":2745,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:47:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:47:16 PM"}
