She looked at the armed bodyguards. \"Don\u0027t you think you\u0027ve overdone it on the muscle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, \"One can never be too careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchuyler nodded. \"Does this mean you\u0027re not mad at me anymore?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s not talk about it right now. We\u0027re here for Lawrence, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you know the whole Conclave is here?\" he asked. \"I saw Warden Oelrich on my flight. And the Duponts and the Carondolets are in my hotel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. Bliss told me Warden Cutler called an emergency session and brought them here. Have they found Lawrence?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the thing. No one\u0027s talking about Lawrence at all. They\u0027re all getting ready for a big dinner at some Brazilian Blue Blood\u0027s house tonight,\" he said, as the car drove into the downtown proper, and the landscape became even more scenic: lush greenery, gorgeous beaches, and equally gorgeous people sunbathing upon them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you staying?\" Schuyler asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Fasano. The new Philippe Starck hotel. Bliss is there too. I would have gotten you your own room, but they didn\u0027t have any more. Do you think you\u0027ll be okay sharing with me?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" she said, trying not to look uncomfortable. \"Listen...about what happened the other night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s not talk about it right now,\" Oliver said lightly. \"I mean, I was being a bit dramatic, wasn\u0027t I? Him or me. Whatever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you didn\u0027t mean it?\" Schuyler asked hopefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Let\u0027s just...let\u0027s just deal with Lawrence first and talk about it later. Is that okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\" Oliver was right. They didn\u0027t have time to dwell on that now. They had to find Lawrence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer grandfather\u0027s continued silence worried her. What if he had been trapped, or restrained, or worse? Had it been wise for him to come to Rio alone? Or to meet with Kingsley\u0027s team? Kingsley who was now unreachable as well, according to Bliss. Schuyler still didn\u0027t understand why Kingsley, who\u0027d been shown to be a Silver Blood - albeit reformed - had been allowed to come back as a Venator. Her grandfather wasn\u0027t a gullible person, and he must have had good reason to trust Kingsley again, especially after what happened in Venice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut still...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes and thought of her grandfather. Pictured his leonine hair, his aristocratic bearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sending was returned immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat are you doing here? Lawrence demanded crossly. He was obviously very annoyed, and worse, sounded perfectly fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSaving you? Schuyler sent tentatively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a sound like a telepathic snort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeet me at the Palace bar. In an hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLawrence was dressed in his usual tweeds and heavy woolens when they met him at the bar at the Copacabana Palace. His face was red, and sweat was dribbling down his forehead. Schuyler thought maybe he wouldn\u0027t complain so much about the weather if he were dressed for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were supposed to remain in New York,\" Lawrence said sternly as a greeting. They took seats at the bar and Lawrence ordered a round of drinks. A Bellini for himself and virgin pi§⟠coladas for his granddaughter and her Conduit. Even if alcohol didn\u0027t affect the vampires, Lawrence liked to abide by Red Blood rules and frowned upon \"underage\" drinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But grandfather ... I heard you were in trouble.\" She squirmed in her seat. She felt relieved that Lawrence was all right, but her grandfather\u0027s steely gaze made her recent actions feel impulsive and foolish. More and more it appeared her trip was unnecessary and unnecessarily dramatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s news to me,\" Lawrence said, bringing out his pipe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why haven\u0027t you returned my sendings then?\" Schuyler asked. \"I\u0027ve been worried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLawrence sucked on his pipe before replying. \"I didn\u0027t hear them. I\u0027ve heard nothing from you until today,\" he said, blowing smoke into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress returned with their drinks, and the three of them clinked glasses. \"There\u0027s no smoking here, sir,\" she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not.\" Lawrence winked as he continued to smoke, conjuring a silver ashtray on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress looked confused and walked away, just another victim of the glom. Lawrence turned to Schuyler. \"Did you do the exercise as I taught you? Concentrate on locating my spirit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course,\" Schuyler said a bit impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver piped in. \"Telepathic messages are encrypted, right? Could someone have - I dunno - subverted them? Or erased them somehow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not how it works,\" Schuyler said. \"They\u0027re not like e-mails sent to a network. Using the glom is a direct line to someone\u0027s consciousness. It can\u0027t be ... messed with. Right, Grandfather?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure. You may have a point, young man,\" Lawrence said thoughtfully as he sipped his drink. \"Using telepathy depends on a vampire\u0027s ability to tap into the \u0027otherworld,\u0027 what the humans call the paranormal. The source of our power comes from the great divide, the place where the usual boundaries between the material and spiritual worlds fall away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that\u0027s Corcovado; the crossing is here,\" Schuyler said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" her grandfather said, his frown lines deepening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Kingsley? Have you seen him?\" Schuyler asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re in touch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So he hasn\u0027t disappeared either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer grandfather looked puzzled. \"No he hasn\u0027t. We\u0027ve been in contact the entire time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchuyler shook her head. \"It\u0027s just... we heard ...\" she said weakly. \"That you and Kingsley...never mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLawrence continued to look mystified as he knocked back his drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOliver excused himself from the table to answer his cell phone, and Schuyler took the opportunity to ask her grandfather something that had been troubling her for weeks. But the answer was not what she was hoping for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLawrence looked directly at his granddaughter, under arched eyebrows. \"There is no way. Suppose Jack breaks his bond, there is no recourse for him. It is against our laws. The Code of the Vampires. If his twin invokes the covenant, there will be a trial. If he is found guilty, he will be condemned. Burned. If he chooses to flee rather than face judgment, his own twin must bring him to justice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchuyler\u0027s breath caught in her throat. \"But Allegra...she\u0027s alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allegra is practically dead at her own hands. Charles argued that the sentence could not be carried out while she was unconscious. But once she wakes up, she is subject to the laws, as well as he.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why does he keep hoping that she will wake up one day?\" Schuyler asked, thinking of Charles kneeling by her mother\u0027s bedside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charles refuses to acknowledge the breaking. But he will have to. If she wakes up, the Coven will insist on a trial.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you are Regis. You could save her,\" Schuyler insisted. You could save Jack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one is above the Code, Schuyler. Not even your mother,\" Lawrence said, and Schuyler could swear she heard anguish in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So Jack will lose his life one way or another.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLawrence cleared his throat and tapped the ashes from his pipe onto the crystal ashtray. \"If he breaks the bond, even if he manages to escape trial, his spirit will diminish. There is no death for our kind, but he will be fully aware of his paralysis. Fortunately he has never been tempted to break his vows. Abbadon is a flirt and a rogue, but he is loyal at his core. He will not sever ties to Azrael so easily. But Schuyler, tell me, why all this interest?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were learning about it in the Committee meetings is all, Grandfather.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that was why Jack never wanted to talk about it. Because there was no way to escape the bond. He had lied to her. A lie born of love. There was no hope for the two of them. He was putting himself at risk by resisting it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMimi was right. Mimi was telling the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout the bond Jack would never be the vampire he was meant to be. He would be half of himself, weakened and destroyed. It would happen slowly over the centuries, but it would happen. His spirit would die. And if that did not get him, the laws would. Mimi would hunt him down. The Conclave would condemn him to the Burning. By loving Schuyler he was risking his very soul. The longer they continued to meet, the more danger he was putting himself in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had to end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought wistfully of their last meeting. That heavenly evening full of art and poetry, how handsome and brave he\u0027d looked when he spoke about breaking the bond. What he would risk to be with her. Schiele\u0027s painting came to mind again. There was a reason why she loved it so much. Two lovers, embracing, as if it were their last. Just as in Anne Sexton\u0027s \"The Break,\" Schuyler\u0027s story was one of a shattered heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere would be no more nights by the fire. No more books slipped under her door. No more secrets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood-bye, Jack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs hard as it would be, as much as it would destroy her very will to even live, Schuyler knew what she had to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to tell another lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lie that would release him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAUDIO RECORDINGS ARCHIVE:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRepository of History\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCLASSIFIED DOCUMENT:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAltithronus Clearance Only\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCordelia Van Alen Personal File\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTranscript, of conversation dated 12/25/98.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCordelia Van Alen: Come here, child.
