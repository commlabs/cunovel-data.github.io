The moms thought they were riding their bikes to the tackle shop for more rubber worms. I was going to go boarding with Clay, and I had my swim trunks on and a towel around my neck when I ran into my mom in the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you up to, Jere?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made a hang ten sign. “I’m gonna go boarding with Clay. See ya!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was about to push the sliding door open when she said, “Hmm. You know what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuspiciously, I asked, “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It might be nice if you stayed inside today and cheered up Belly. Poor thing could use some cheering up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aw, Mom—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please, Jeremiah?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. I didn’t want to stay home and cheer up Belly. I wanted to go boarding with Clay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I didn’t say anything, she added, “We can grill out tonight. I’ll let you be in charge of the burgers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed again, louder this time. My mom still thought that letting me fire up the grill and flip hamburgers was a big treat for me. Not that it wasn’t fun, but still. I opened my mouth to say “no thanks,” but then I saw the fond, happy look on her face, the way she just knew I would say yes. So I did. “Fine,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went back upstairs and changed out of my swim trunks and then I joined Belly in the TV room. I sat as far away from her as I could. The last thing I needed was to catch her cold and be sidelined for a week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are you still here?” she asked, blowing her nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s too hot outside,” I said. “Wanna watch a movie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not that hot outside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How would you know if you haven’t been out there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe narrowed her eyes. “Did your mom make you stay inside with me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ha!” Belly grabbed the remote and changed the channel. “I know you’re lying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am not!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlowing her nose loudly she said, “ESP, remember?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not real. Can I have the remote?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head and held the remote to her chest protectively. “No. My germs are all over it. Sorry. Is there any more toast bread?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToast bread was what we called the bread my mom bought at the farmer’s market. It came sliced, and it was white and thick and a little bit sweet. I’d had the last three slices of toast bread that morning. I’d slathered it with butter and blackberry jam and I’d eaten it really fast before anyone else got up. With four kids and two adults, bread went really fast. It was every man for himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No more toast bread left,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Conrad and Steven are such pigs,” she said, sniffling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuiltily, I said, “I thought all you wanted to eat were grape Popsicles.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. “When I woke up this morning I wanted toast bread. I think maybe I’m getting better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t look any better to me. Her eyes were swollen and her skin looked grayish, and I don’t think she’d washed her hair in days because it was all stringy and matted looking. “Maybe you should take a shower,” I said. “My mom says you always feel better after you take a shower.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you saying I smell?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, no.” I looked out the window. It was a clear day, no clouds. I bet Clay was having a blast. I bet Steven and Conrad were too. Conrad had emptied out his old first-grade piggy bank and found a ton of quarters. I bet they’d be at the arcade all afternoon. I wondered how long Clay was gonna be outside. I might be able to catch him in a few hours; it’d still be light out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess Belly caught me staring out the window, because she said, in this really snotty voice, “Just go if you want to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I said I didn’t,” I snapped. Then I took a breath. My mom wouldn’t like it if I made Belly upset when she was all sick like this. And she really did look lonely. I kinda felt sorry for her, being stuck inside all day. Summer colds sucked more than anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I said, “Do you want me to teach you how to play poker?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t know how to play,” she scoffed. “Conrad beats you every time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine,” I said. I stood up. I didn’t feel that sorry for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never mind,” she said. “You can teach me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat back down. “Pass the cards,” I said gruffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could tell Belly felt bad because she said, “You shouldn’t sit too close. You’ll get sick too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s okay,” I said. “I never get sick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Neither does Conrad,” she said, and I rolled my eyes. Belly worshipped Conrad, just like Steven did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Conrad does get sick, he gets sick all the time in the winter. He has a weak immune system,” I told her, although I didn’t know if that was true or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged, but I could tell she didn’t believe me. She handed me the cards. “Just deal,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe played poker all afternoon and it was actually pretty fun. I got sick two days later, but I didn’t mind that much. Belly stayed home with me and we played more poker and we watched The Simpsons a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter thirty-five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejeremiah\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I heard Belly come up the stairs, I met her in the hallway. “So? What’s going on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My mom’s calling your dad,” she said gravely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She is? Wow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, so, don’t, like, give up already. It’s not over yet.” Then she gave me one of her wrinkly-nose smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI clapped her on the back and practically sprinted down the stairs. There was Laurel, wiping down the counter. When she saw me, she said, “Your father’s coming over. For breakfast.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurel nodded. “Will you go to the store and get some things he likes? Eggs and bacon. Muffin mix. And those big grapefruit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurel hated to cook. She had definitely never made my dad a lumberjack breakfast. “Why are you cooking for him?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because he’s a child and children are cranky when they haven’t been fed,” she said in that dry way of hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut of nowhere, I said, “Sometimes I hate him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated before saying, “Sometimes I do too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I waited for her to say, “But he is your father,” the way my mom used to. Laurel didn’t, though. Laurel was no bullshit. She didn’t say things she didn’t mean. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/it-s-not-summer-without-you-summer-2/page-40.html","bookId":2724,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:01 PM"}
