With your weak physique, how can you be a proper soldier? Before the recruit training starts, this Battalion Commander will be giving you some personal tough training. If you can’t finish it, just get lost from here and don’t throw our 3rd Battalion’s face! I’ll come and find you after lunch.” After saying that, she spun around and stalked off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class\u003d\"normal\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;Zhou Weiqing watched her leave, after which he leapt to his feet, the sly expression on his face gone. “There is such a difference between people’s personalities. From now on, I shall not anger this Battalion Commander already. Compared to Difuya, she is such a kind soul.” Honestly, he had not imagined that he would be let off so easily, he could easily foresee that if the person administering the beatings had been Difuya, he would definitely have to suffer all the remaining 9 blows. Zhou Weiqing had clearly seen the expression on Shangguan Bing’er’s face after the first blow, that she couldn’t bear to hit him a second time, and he had a very good impression and liking of her. Of course, for this rascal, that liking caused him to slyly think back of the feeling in his hands from the previous day, causing him to drool again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class\u003d\"normal\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;Soon it was noon; the lunch in the army was nothing special, it was simple and only meant to ensure stomachs were filled. Since Zhou Weiqing wasn’t used to any special treatment or foods at home, he was fine with just filling his stomach with the standard fare. Of course, he was eating at the ordinary soldier’s mess, the officers had a separate mess area. By the time he got back from lunch, he saw that Shangguan Bing’er was already standing outside his tent waiting for him, dressed in the same outfit as earlier in the morning. Zhou Weiqing was secretly thinking, how great it would be if she were his girlfriend waiting for him. Of course, it was just a passing thought – Zhou Weiqing’s greatest strength was that he knew his limits, he would not really expect that the top genius in the empire would fall in love with such a trash who could not cultivate like him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class\u003d\"normal\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;“Greetings Battalion Commander.” Zhou Weiqing quickly walked up towards Shangguan Bing’er and gave her a smart salute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class\u003d\"normal\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;Although Shangguan Bing’er had a very kind nature, but she was also very intelligent. In the morning, after she had left Zhou Weiqing after the whipping, she realised that she had been fooled. After all, she had not used much strength, how could he be in such pain? That rascal had clearly been acting. He might look very honest but that Little Fatty Zhou was definitely not a good person, if she did not punish him for that she would not be able to assuage her anger. To think that the first man to ever touch her body was such a rascal, Shangguan Bing’er almost couldn’t control her anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class\u003d\"normal\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;“Little Fatty Zhou, let me ask you, to an archer what is the most important?” Shangguan Bing’er asked solemnly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class\u003d\"normal\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;Zhou Weiqing answered unhesitatingly: “Speed, strength and accuracy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class\u003d\"normal\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;Shangguan Bing’er heard his swift and accurate reply and was rather surprised, “Very good, you’re right.
