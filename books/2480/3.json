{"id":83770,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe big woman in the Burger King uniform pushed a cart along the aisles of the Piggly Wiggly supermarket. She was at the Mableton Shopping Center about a quarter mile from her apartment. On her blouse she wore a yellow Smiley Face button. Her hair, shiny with smoke and grease from the grills, hung loosely around her shoulders. Her face was composed and calm, without expression. She picked out cans of soup, corned beef hash, and vegetables. at the frozen food section she chose a few TV dinners and a box of Weight Watchers chocolate fudge bars. She moved methodically and carefully, as if powered by a tense inner spring. She had to stop for a moment and breathe the chill air where the meat was kept, because she had the sensation that the store\u0027s air was too thick for her lungs. She smelled the blood of fresh slaughters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Mary Terror went on, a careful shopper who checked prices and ingredients. Foods could be full of poisons. She avoided boxes with scraped sides or cans that had been dented. Every once in a while she paused to look over her shoulder and gauge who might be following her. The FBI bastards wore masks of human skin that they could peel on and off, and they could make themselves look young or old, fat or skinny, tall or short. They were lurking everywhere, like cockroaches in a filthy house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she didn\u0027t think she was being followed today. Sometimes the back of her neck tingled and goose bumps rose on her arms, and it was then she knew that the pigs were near. Today, though, there were only housewives and a couple of farmer types buying groceries. She checked their shoes. The pigs always wore shined shoes. Her alarm system was silent. Still, you never knew, and that was why she had a Compact Off-Duty Police pistol in the bottom of her purse that weighed twenty-eight ounces and packed four.357 Magnum bullets. She stopped by the wine section and picked a cheap bottle of sangria. Then it was on to select a bag of pretzels and a box of Ritz crackers. The next stop was an aisle over, where the jars of baby food were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary pushed her cart around the corner, and before her was a mother with her baby. The woman\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;a girl, really, maybe seventeen or eighteen\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;had her child strapped into a bassinet in her cart. She had red hair and freckles, and the baby had a little shock of pale red hair, too. The child, dressed in a lime-green jump suit, sucked on a pacifier and stared out at the world through large blue eyes, hands and feet at war with each other. The mother, who wore a pink sweater and bluejeans, was choosing some baby food from the Gerber\u0027s shelf. That was also Mary\u0027s preferred brand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary guided her cart in close and the young mother said, \"\u0027Scuse me,\" and backed her cart off a few feet. Mary pretended to be searching for a certain food, but she was watching the red-haired infant. The girl caught her looking, and Mary snapped on a smile. \"What a pretty baby,\" she said. She offered her hand into the cart, and the baby grasped her index finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks.\" The girl returned the smile, but uncertainly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Babies are a joy, aren\u0027t theyi\" Mary asked. She\u0027d already checked the girl\u0027s shoes: scuffed-up sneakers. The child\u0027s fingers clenched and unclenched Mary\u0027s finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes\u0027m, I reckon they are. \u0027Course, when you got a kid, that\u0027s it, ain\u0027t iti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s iti\" Mary lifted her eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know. a kid takes up an awful lot of time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a child with a child, Mary thought. She could see the dark hollows under the young mother\u0027s eyes. You don\u0027t deserve to have a baby, Mary thought. You haven\u0027t paid your dues. Her face kept its smile. \"What\u0027s his namei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her name. She\u0027s a she. amanda.\" The girl selected a few jars of assorted food and put them into the cart, and Mary worked her finger loose from the child\u0027s grip. \"Nice talkin\u0027 to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My baby likes the strained pears,\" Mary said, and took two jars of it off the shelf. She could feel her cheek muscles aching. \"I\u0027ve got a fine, healthy boy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl was already moving away, pushing the cart before her. Mary heard the soft wet noise of the baby sucking on her pacifier, and then the cart reached the end of the aisle and the girl turned to the right. Mary felt an urge to go after the girl, grab her by the shoulders, and make her listen. Tell her that the world was dark and full of evil, and it chewed up little red-haired baby girls. Tell her that the agents of Moloch amerika lurked in every corner, and they could suck your soul out through your eyeballs. Tell her that you could walk through the most beautiful garden and hear the scream of the butterfly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCareful, Mary thought. Be careful. She knew secrets that she should not share. No one at the Burger King knew about her baby, and that was for the best. She got control of herself, like the clamping down of a lid, and she chose a few more jars of various flavors, put them into the cart, and went on. Her index finger still had the heat of the infant\u0027s touch in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused at the magazine rack. The new Rolling Stone was in. On the cover was the picture of a band of young women. The Bangles. She didn\u0027t know their music. Rolling Stone wasn\u0027t the same magazine it used to be, when it folded over in the middle and had articles by Hunter Thompson and drawings by that weird Steadman dude who always showed people puking up their angry guts. She could relate to those drawings of rage and bile. Now Rolling Stone was full of glossy ads, and their politics sucked the bourgeois cock. She\u0027d seen Eric Clapton doing those beer commercials; if she had a bottle of it, she\u0027d break it and cut his throat with the shards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put the Rolling Stone into her cart anyway. It was something to read, though she didn\u0027t know the new music or the new bands. Used to be she consumed the Stone from cover to cover, when it was a rag and the heroes were still alive. They had all burned out young, and that was why they were called stars. all young and dead, and she was still alive and older. She felt cheated sometimes. She felt as if she\u0027d missed a train that would not come again, and she was still haunting the station with an un-punched ticket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the checkout line. New cashier. acne on her cheeks. Get out the checkbook, the checks in the name of Ginger Coles. Careful, keep the gun down in the bottom of the purse. Write out the amount. Damn, buying groceries fucks up a budget! Sign it. Ginger Coles. \"There you go,\" she told the girl as she pushed the check and her driver\u0027s license forward. The license showed her smiling picture, her hair combed back and cut a little shorter than it was now. She had a strong face with a straight, narrow nose and a high forehead. Depending on the light and the clothes she wore, the color of her eyes shifted from pale green to frosty gray. She watched the cashier write down her license number on the back of the check. \"Place of employmenti\" the girl asked, and Mary said, \"United Parcel -\" She stopped herself. a whirl of identities was spinning through her mind, like a little universe. No, not United Parcel Service. She\u0027d worked there under another name from 1984 to 1986, at the shipping warehouse in Tampa. \"Sorry,\" she said as the cashier stared blankly at her. \"That\u0027s my old job. I\u0027m the assistant day manager at a Burger King.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeahi\" The girl\u0027s eyes showed a little interest. \"Which onei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea cold spear went through Mary\u0027s heart. She felt her smile slip a notch. \"In Norcross,\" she said, which was a lie. She worked at the location on Blessingham Road, about six miles away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just got this job,\" the cashier said, \"but the pay ain\u0027t nothin\u0027. You do the hirin\u0027 and alli\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" The acne might be makeup, Mary thought. The girl might not be as young or as dumb as she looked. \"The manager does that.\" Her hand slid partway into her purse, and she could feel the chill of the pistol\u0027s metal with her fingertips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like just standin\u0027 around. I like to be movin\u0027. You need any help over therei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. We\u0027ve got all the help we need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl shrugged. \"Well, maybe I\u0027ll come in and fill out an application anyway. You get free burgers there, don\u0027t youi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary sensed it. Someone coming up behind her. She heard a soft noise, like a gun coming out of an oiled leather holster, and her breath snagged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whirled around, her hand on the pistol\u0027s grip down in her purse, and she was a second away from drawing it when the red-haired young mother stopped her cart with the baby in it. The infant was still sucking wetly on the pacifier, eyes roaming back and forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okayi\" the cashier asked. \"Ladyi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smile had left Mary Terror\u0027s face. For a small space of time the young mother caught a glimpse of something that made her pull the cart back and instinctively put her hand on her infant\u0027s chest in a protective gesture. What was standing before her she couldn\u0027t exactly say, because the sight was gone too soon, but she was left with the memory of the big woman\u0027s teeth clenched together and a pair of slitted eyes as green as a cat\u0027s. For those few stretching seconds the woman seemed to tower over her, and something cold came out of the big woman\u0027s skin like winter\u0027s mist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it was over, as fast as a fingersnap. The clenched teeth and the slitted eyes were gone, and Mary Terror\u0027s face was bland and soft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ladyi\" the cashier said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Such a pretty baby,\" Mary told the young mother, who didn\u0027t yet recognize what she was feeling as fear. Mary\u0027s gaze quickly scanned the area around the checkouts. She had to get out of there, and quickly. \"I\u0027m fine,\" she said to the cashier. \"am I readyi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. One sec and I\u0027ll get you sacked.\" The groceries went into two sacks. This was the dangerous time, Mary was thinking. If they were going to come after her, it would be when she had the groceries in her arms. She put away her license and hooked her purse over her shoulder. She left it unzipped, so she could get at the pistol in a hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name\u0027s Toni,\" the cashier said. \"Maybe I\u0027ll come in and fill out an application.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she ever saw this girl again, Mary thought, she would kill her. From now on she would go to the Food Giant across the highway. She took the sacks in her arms and headed for the exit. a man in a camouflage jacket, the kind deer hunters wore, was walking across the parking lot in the nasty rain. Mary watched him carefully as she hurried to her pickup truck, but he didn\u0027t even glance at her. She put the groceries on the floorboard on the passenger side, next to the package from art \u0026amp; Larry\u0027s Toys. Underneath the dashboard was a sawed-off shotgun secured by metal clips. She got behind the wheel, locked both doors, started the engine, and drove to her apartment by a circuitous route. all the time her hands were gripped hard on the steering wheel, her eyes ticking back and forth from the rearview mirror, and she hissed between gritted teeth: \"Shit! Shit! Screwed up! Goddamn screwed up!\" a light sheen of sweat was on her face. She took long, deep breaths. \"Hold on. Take it easy, take it easy. Nobody knows you. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody knows you.\" She repeated it like a mantra, all the way to the red brick apartment building that had a trailer park on one side and a machine shop where truck engines were repaired on the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eas Mary guided her pickup into her parking space, she saw a grizzled face peering out a window. It was the old man in the apartment next to hers. Shecklett was in his late sixties, and he rarely came out except to gather up the aluminum cans from the highway. He coughed a lot at night, too. She\u0027d checked through the trash he\u0027d brought out to the dumpster one night, and found an empty bottle of J. W. Dant bourbon, TV dinner trays, a Cavalier magazine with some of the ads clipped out, and pieces of a letter she\u0027d taped together under a strong light. It was from a woman named Paula, and Mary remembered some of it: I really would like to come visit. Would that be okayi Bill says it\u0027s fine with him. We were talking, and we can\u0027t understand why you don\u0027t come out and be with us. Ought to be ashamed, living the way you do with all that money you\u0027ve saved from the store. Don\u0027t pretend you didn\u0027t. I know, Mom told me, so there. anyway, Kevin asks about his grandpap every single day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eas Mary pulled the handbrake up she saw Shecklett move away from the window, deeper into the darkness of his apartment. He watched her come and go as he watched the black woman upstairs and the young redneck couple on the other side of Mary\u0027s apartment. She would have wondered about the shine on his shoes if he hadn\u0027t been in the building long before Mary had moved in. Still, she didn\u0027t like being watched, being inspected and judged. When she decided it was time to leave, she might do something about Grandpap Shecklett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary picked up the two sacks of groceries and took them inside. The apartment still smelled of burned plastic. The front room, paneled with pinewood, was neat and orderly; she never used it. a lava lamp cast a blue glow, the matter inside slowly coagulating and breaking apart. It made her think of semen searching for an egg. She laid the two sacks on the kitchen\u0027s countertop and flicked a dead roach off the scarred Formica. Then she went back out to get her new baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard the pickup\u0027s passenger door being opened before she reached the apartment\u0027s threshold. The door\u0027s hinges had a high, distinctive squeak. Her heart gave a violent kick, and she felt the blood swell in her face. Shecklett! He was rummaging in the truck! My baby! she thought, and she raced out the door with long, powerful strides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone was leaning into the truck\u0027s passenger side. Mary grasped the door, slammed it against the offending body, and heard a wail of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ow! Jesus Christ!\" He came out of the truck, his eyes hazed with hurt, and his hand pressed against his side. \"You tryin\u0027 to bust my fuckin\u0027 ribsi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not Shecklett, though she was sure Shecklett was watching the drama from his window. It was Gordie Powers, who was twenty-five years old and had light brown hair that hung around his shoulders. He was as thin as a wish, his face long and gaunt, a stubble of beard on his cheeks and chin. He wore faded jeans and a flannel shirt under a battered black leather jacket decorated with metal studs. \"Man!\" he said. \"You \u0027bout knocked the piss outta me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I gave you a warning tap,\" she said. \"What\u0027re you trying to steali\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothin\u0027! I just drove up and saw you gettin\u0027 your groceries out! I thought I\u0027d bring in the other sack for you!\" He stepped away from the truck with a thin-lipped sneer. \"That\u0027s what I get for bein\u0027 a Good Samaritan, huhi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary glanced to the left and saw Gordie\u0027s silver Mazda sports car parked a few spaces away. She said, \"Thanks anyway, but I\u0027ll get it.\" She picked up the package from the floorboard, and he saw the imprint aRT \u0026amp; LaRRY\u0027S TOYS across the sack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027cha gonna doi\" Gordie asked. \"Play gamesi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary slammed the door and went into her apartment. Gordie followed, as she knew he would. He\u0027d come to see her, after all. She\u0027d placed an order last night, before Robby had been so bad. \"Smells funny in here,\" Gordie commented as he closed the door and turned the latch. \"You burn somethin\u0027i\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. My dinner.\" Mary took the package into her bedroom and put it into the closet. Then, out of habit, she switched on the television set and turned it to the Cable News Network. Lynne Russell was on. Mary liked Lynne Russell because she looked like a big woman. The scene changed to a view of pig cars with their blue lights flashing, and a talking head saying something about somebody getting murdered. There was blood on a stretcher-sheet and the shape of a body. The images were hypnotic, a brutal pulse of life. Sometimes Mary watched CNN for hours on end, unable and unwilling to do anything but lie in bed like a parasite feeding off the torment of other human beings. When she was flying high on LSD, the scenes became three-dimensional and pushed into the room, and that could really be a heavy trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard the rustle of a sack. Then his voice: \"Hey, Ginger! How come you got all this baby foodi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ean answer had come to her by the time she walked back into the kitchen. \"a cat comes around sometimes. I\u0027ve been feeding it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"a cati Likes baby foodi Man, I hate cats. Gimme the creeps.\" Gordie\u0027s beady brown eyes were always moving, invading private spaces. They found the crust of melted plastic on one of the oven\u0027s burners, registered the fact, and moved on. \"Got roaches,\" he noticed. He walked around the kitchen as Mary put the groceries away. Gordie stopped before one of the framed magazine pictures of a smiling infant. \"You got a thing about babies, huhi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Mary said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How come you don\u0027t have a kid, theni\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeep the secret, Mary thought. Gordie was a mouse nibbling at a crumb between a tiger\u0027s fangs. \"Just never did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, it\u0027s funny, huhi Been doin\u0027 business with you... what, five or six monthsi and I don\u0027t know nothin\u0027 about you.\" He pulled a toothpick from the pocket of his shirt and probed at his small yellow teeth. \"Don\u0027t even know where you\u0027re from.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoaaaaaa.\" He shook his hands in the air in mock fear. \"Don\u0027t scare me, sister. No, I ain\u0027t shittin\u0027. Where\u0027re you fromi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean where was I borni\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. You ain\u0027t from around here, \u0027cause there ain\u0027t no Georgia peaches in your accent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe decided she\u0027d tell him. Maybe it was because it had been a long time since she\u0027d said it: \"Richmond, Virginia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So how come you\u0027re herei How come you ain\u0027t in Virginiai\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary stacked the TV dinners and put them in the refrigerator\u0027s freezer. Her mind was interweaving fictions. \"Marriage went bad a few years ago. My husband caught me with a younger dude. He was a jealous bastard. Said he\u0027d cut me open and leave me bleeding in the woods where nobody could find me. He said if he didn\u0027t do it, he had friends who would. So I split, and I never looked back. I kept on driving. I\u0027ve been here and there, but I guess I haven\u0027t found home yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cut you openi\" Gordie grinned around his toothpick. \"I don\u0027t believe it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean... you\u0027re a mighty big lady. Take a hell of a man to get you down, huhi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put the jars of baby food into the cupboard. Gordie made a sucking sound on his toothpick, like the infant with the pacifier. \"anything else you want to knowi\" She closed the cupboard and turned to face him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Like... how old are youi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too old for any more bull shit,\" she said. \"Did you bring my orderi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right here next to my heart.\" Gordie reached into his jacket\u0027s inside pocket and brought out a cellophane bag that held a small square of waxed paper. \"Thought you might like the design.\" He handed the bag to Mary, and she could see what was on the paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour small yellow Smiley Faces, identical to the button she wore, were spaced equidistantly on the square.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My friend\u0027s a real artiste,\" Gordie said. \"He can do just about any kind of design. Client wanted little airplanes the other day. another dude asked for an american flag. Costs extra with all them colors. anyhow, my friend enjoys his work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your friend does a good job.\" She held the paper up against the light. The Smiley Faces were yellow with lemon-flavored food coloring, and the tiny black dots of the eyes were cheap but potent acid brewed in a lab near atlanta. She got her wallet out of her purse, and removed the Magnum automatic, too. She laid the pistol on the countertop as she counted out fifty dollars for her connection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice little piece,\" Gordie said. His fingers grazed the gun. \"I sure as hell got you a good deal on it, too.\" His hand accepted the money, and the bills went into his jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary had bought the Magnum from him back in September, two months after she\u0027d been steered to Gordie by a bartender in a midtown lounge called the Purple People Eater. The.38 in her drawer and the sawed-off shotgun had been purchased from other connections in the last few years. Wherever she went, Mary made the effort to find somebody who could supply her with two of her passions: LSD and guns. She\u0027d always had a love affair with guns: their smell and weight thrilled her, their beauty dark and brooding. \"Feminist cock envy\" was how he\u0027d put it, way back when. Lord Jack, speaking from the gray mist of memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe LSD and the guns were links to her past, and without them life would be as hollow as her womb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. So that does it, righti\" Gordie removed the toothpick and slid it back into his pocket. \"Until next timer\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. Gordie started out of the kitchen, and Mary followed him with the acid-loaded Smiley Faces in her hand. When he left, she would give birth. The infant was in the closet in her bedroom, confined in a box. She would lick a Smiley Face and feed her new baby and watch the hateful world kill itself on CNN. Gordie was reaching toward the latch. Mary watched him move, as if in slow motion. She\u0027d had so much LSD over the years that she could slow things down when she wanted to, could make them break into strobelike movements. Gordie\u0027s hand was on the latch, and he was about to open the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a skinny little bastard. a dope dealer and gun smuggler. But he was a human being, and Mary suddenly realized that she wanted to be touched by human hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGordie stopped, the latch almost thrown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got plansi\" Mary asked. She was ready for rejection, ready to curl back into her armored shell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGordie paused. He frowned. \"Plansi Like plans for whati\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like plans to eat. Do you have anywhere to goi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m gonna pick up my girlfriend in a couple of hours.\" He checked his Swatch. \"Give or take.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMary held the Smiley Faces in front of his nose. \"You want a tastei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGordie\u0027s eyes ticked from the offering to Mary and back again. \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. He\u0027d caught an unspoken invitation\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;not for the LSD, but for something else. Maybe it was the way she crowded his space, or maybe it was the slight tilt of her head toward the bedroom. Whatever it was, Gordie knew the language. He had to think about this for a minute; she was a client, and it was bad business to screw clients. She wasn\u0027t a raging beauty, and she was old. Over thirty, for sure. But he\u0027d never sacked a six-foot-tall woman before, and he wondered what it would be like to swim in that swamp of flesh. She looked like she had a nice pair, too. Her face could be pretty if she wore makeup. Still... there was something mighty strange about her, with all these baby pictures on the walls and\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell! Gordie thought. Why noti He\u0027d screw a tree if it had a knothole big enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" he said, his grin beginning to spread. \"I guess I would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s good.\" Mary reached past him, and double-locked the door with its chain. Gordie smelled the aroma of hamburgers in her hair. When she looked at him again, her face was very close and her eyes were a shade between green and gray. \"I\u0027ll make dinner, and then we\u0027ll trip out. You like minestrone soup and ham sandwichesi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\" He shrugged. \"Whatever.\" Trip out, she\u0027d said. That was an ancient expression. He heard it in old movies on TV about the sixties and hippies and shit like that. He watched her as she went into the kitchen, and in another moment he heard her run water into a pot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come in and talk to me,\" Mary said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGordie glanced at the latch and the doorchain. Still can go if you want to. That big woman\u0027ll grind you down to white jelly if you don\u0027t watch out. He stared at the lava lamp, his face daubed blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gordiei\" Her voice was soft, as if she were speaking to a baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, okay. You got any beeri\" He took off his leather jacket, threw it on the checkered sofa in the living room, and went into the kitchen where Mary Terror was making soup and sandwiches for two. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mine/page-3.html","bookId":2480,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:54:55 PM"}
