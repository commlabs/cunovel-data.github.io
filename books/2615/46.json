Why can’t they let her be?” I sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because they want her to be happy, and in their eyes, that entails her marrying and having security.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scoffed at his words out of habit and he lightly tugged one of my curls to stop my scowl. I tucked my hand into the fold of his arm and smiled up at him. He reminded me so much of my father as he closed his hand over mine that it warmed my heart and lifted my spirits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you ready to have a lovely evening, Countess Dracula?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why, yes I am!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then let us go forth and give the gossips plenty to wag their tongues about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughing, we walked into the depths of the crowd to mingle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite my loathing of the woman, Csilla does throw the grandest parties I have ever attended. Chrysanthemums of every color overflowed ornate vases and swaths of fabric in the colors of fall were draped artistically around the pillars and over doorways. I was surprised to see potted trees lining the walls, their colorful leaves adding to the festive atmosphere. The Baroness strode through the party greeting people dressed as the Greek goddess Demeter. Her white gown and gold tiara were a lovely contrast to her dark hair and eyes. I found her dress to be a bit scandalous for it exposed her back and swooped daringly over her cleavage. But it is her nature to provoke and I saw her eyes glittering with delight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She is in her element,” I muttered to Percy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Most certainly.” His gaze lingered on her as she passed. I could not read his expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I once longed to be what she is,” I confessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Truly?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. A woman who does as she wills with no regard to the opinions of anyone else about her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What changed?” Percy tilted his head and regarded me with interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pursed my lips slightly, then rolled my shoulders. “I realized I am not cold-hearted enough to hurt those I care about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah, I see. And she cares for no one?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only herself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy gave me an affectionate smile. “I do believe you are right.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do I feel I have just passed some grand test?” I eyed him thoughtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughing, he shook his head. “Oh, no test. I am just pleased to hear your words. You’re quite young to have attained such wisdom despite your rebellious heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I may have a rebellious heart, but I could not bear to remove myself from those I care about. I have lost far too much too lose any more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my utter surprise, he kissed my cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis, of course, sent the gossips into a frenzy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are a lovely and noble woman. I am pleased you are my friend.” His words were spoken in English and they touched my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are so dear to me, I am honored that you are my friend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling, we walked to the foyer to wait for Laura. As more guests arrived and the atmosphere of the ball became more joyous, I began to revel in the evening completely. Though I wished with all my heart that Ignatius would appear at my side, I allowed myself to fully embrace the joviality of the ball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Laura appeared, I gave out a cry of delight. She was ravishing in her costume and made a lovely dryad. Smiling broadly, she rushed to us. Clutching my hands, she beamed with happiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You look amazing, Glynis!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As do you, Laura!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Percy! Oh, my! You’re so handsome!” Laura gripped his hand as he kissed her on both cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Laura and Glynis, the two most beautiful women in this ball, may I have the pleasure of a dance later with each of you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura tittered as I smacked him lightly with my hand. “You tease us!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not lying! You are the most ravishing women in this ball. My poor old heart cannot withstand such beauty!” Gripping his chest dramatically, he staggered back from us. Laura giggled with delight as I playfully hit him again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Laura, come here,” Sir Stephan called out from nearby. Clad as a scarecrow, I found him a bit frightening in appearance. Beside him, his wife Maria was dressed as a milk maid. Both of her parents looked put out at her interaction with Percy and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have to go for a little bit,” she said with a sigh. “Otherwise, they shall make me leave. They want me to spend time with Dietrich.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perhaps I should claim I am courting you,” Percy grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaura smiled at him sweetly. “I do not want them to gain hope only to have it dashed later. They know I despise Dietrich, but I shall do as they ask so I can spend time with you both. You are my dearest friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you’re ours!” My voice was filled with my passion and I kissed her cheek fondly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blushed to the roots of her dark hair and giggled. Reluctantly, she left us to do her parents bidding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s all a lot of nonsense.” Percy sighed. The feathers of his mask waved about his face as he shook his head. I fancied it would fly off and circle the room at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought you said they only want what is best for her,” I reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, I do understand their motivation in this situation, yet I cannot help but feel that their constant thrust for her to marry is only making her more resolute in her desire not to marry. I want Laura to be happy, but I fear they are closing her heart completely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grew to love Percy even more in that moment. I tucked my hand into the crook of his arm and leaned against him. “We shall do our best to make certain that her heart remains open to love. Even if it is just the love of friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Agreed.” He patted my hand and cast a long look in the direction of Sir Stephan as he guided Laura toward her terrible suitor. “Like lambs to the slaughter. I have to admit you and Laura have opened my eyes. I never truly thought about how young women are bartered off like goods to the highest bidder, so to speak.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Certainly you had many young women pushed in your direction during your life. I cannot believe you were not seen as a suitable match.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was a pauper when I was younger. Our estate was falling down about our ears and it was my sister who married well and brought money into the family. I was actually not deemed a good catch for a long time. I come from a respectable family, but without the funds.” He shrugged. “I became a successful businessman and later found my Abigail. It was good enough for me. And for her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am so sorry that she is not with us.” I rested my head on his shoulder. “It would have been lovely to know her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One day I shall be reunited with her. Until then, I shall enjoy what life I have left. I must confess my friendships with you and Laura have significantly lifted my spirits.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As you have lifted mine!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether we wandered through the many rooms housing the party. I pretended to eat the food I plucked from the buffet and drink the wine poured into my glass. I chatted with other attendees, admiring their costumes and laughing at their jokes. There was a great amount of merriment about the festivities, as though everyone knew we would soon be locked in our homes waiting for the spring to come. I danced with a few gentlemen before Percy and I claimed our dance together. We conspired with each other and kept an eye on Laura as she was escorted about the party by Dietrich. He cast furtive looks in our direction, his discomfort clear. Laura appeared bored and disinterested in him, but he persisted on dragging her about. To my disgust, Sir Stephan and Maria appeared quite pleased with their interaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Percy, my aren’t you handsome,” Csilla purred as she appeared beside us. Her eyes were sparkling dangerously from all the wine she had consumed and her daring neckline was drooping lower on the roundness of her breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am not nearly as intriguing as you are,” Percy answered a bit glibly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him credit for not peering down at her cleavage. I had the desire to tuck her bosom back into the fabric.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCsilla laughed gaily as she pressed her hand to his chest. Leaning toward him, she whispered, “If I am so intriguing why do you evade my seductions?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was taught to avoid temptation when I attended church as a boy. I adhere to that teaching even now.” Percy sipped his wine, an amused expression on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Am I tempting?” Csilla’s gaze slid toward me. She lifted her chin to bare her throat at me. “Am I, Countess Dracula?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWanting to be rid of her, I said, “Always.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrasping my hand, she drew close to me. “I wish to tempt you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePercy’s eyes widened behind his mask. Not knowing my nature, I was certain he believed that the baroness was attempting to seduce me. “Temptation comes in many forms, my baroness. Your form, though pleasing to the eye, is not to my taste. Besides, what would my husband say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTossing back her head, she laughed with delight. “He would be quite pleased, I’m sure.” With a sultry glance at Percy, she slinked away into the party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She is...” Percy faltered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Disturbing.” I felt angered by her actions. She was dangerous with her blatant actions and double entendres.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo counter our discomfort, we danced. The air was warm and thick with the fragrance of the candles, food, and humans. It was soothing and I cast away my worries as we twirled, bowed, and pranced our way across the floor. The music and chatter were a comforting sound. I was accustomed to this sort of affair and I could almost imagine I was once more in England. As always I feel nearly mortal when I am at social gatherings. It allows me to forget the terrors I have endured since the night my family arrived at Vlad Dracula’s castle. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-46.html","bookId":2615,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:48:37 PM"}
