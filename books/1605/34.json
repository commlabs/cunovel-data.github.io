Mellow out. He probably said mutated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes and jerk my hand free, \"I don’t mellow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nudges me, \"I like that about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles, \"Of course I do. I never want you to change. I like the feisty, crazy girl you are. I don’t like it when you savagely attack people, or make bad choices and put your life in danger, and scare the shit out of me. But I like that it\u0027s never dull and I never know what\u0027s going on in that brain of yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug, \"Probably a lot less than you think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe round a corner and he points, \"That’s it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel sick again. People are few and far between.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull out the card Bernie made from the one I had stolen and swipe it. It works. I glance up at Will. He shakes his head, \"Feels like a trap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That, or we are just the most jaded people on earth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckles and holds the door. We walk inside and instantly the lights do the thing they were doing in the other building. I groan, \"I hate these lights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too. Makes it hard to focus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look back at him, \"Maybe that’s the plan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walk into a reception area. A man walks out of a door and smiles at us, \"Can I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold up my ID badge, \"We are looking for a friend of ours, Bernard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods and looks around, \"Bernie. Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see a look in his eyes and punch hard. His head snaps back. Will grabs him and puts the chokehold on him. He passes out. Will carries him to a room and opens the door, placing him inside of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit,\" I mutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe enter the door, peeking our heads in. It\u0027s a lab but none of the lights are on. No one is in there…if they are, they\u0027re not moving around. Will opens another door, \"Stairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe climb them to the next floor, checking for lights until we reach the fifth floor. Lights in the far back corner of the huge, open floor, stop us both in our tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I help you?\" a man asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn, swinging my gun hard and backhand him. Will grabs him, snapping his neck. He winces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug, \"Wrong side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes flare, but he drags the body inside and hides it under a desk. We duck and creep through the desks and shelves, not that it matters. The lights come on over us as we walk. The closer we get the less we see over top of the furniture. I sneak to a corner and peek. A man is reading and doing work at a desk. He\u0027s typing something but we can\u0027t see his face. He doesn\u0027t look up at the lights moving in the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown, \"Is that a computer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill nods, Looks like one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand up and tuck my gun again. Will undoes a button on my shirt. I swat at him but he puts a finger to his lips, \"Trust me. Act dumb and tired from working all day. They are not expecting us. He didn’t even bat at eyelash at us walking and making the lights come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow and shake my head. He grabs my face, kissing me hard. When he let\u0027s go I stumble back and out of the hiding spot. I smile at the man who glances up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" I say. My lips are still shiny from the kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grins, \"You all done for the night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"I am. I\u0027m beat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sits back, folding his arms and grinning. \"What section do you work in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI point back at the other desks, \"I work up a floor. I was coming down and saw the lights. I didn’t want to walk home alone. Thought I would see… if you were leaving soon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stands up from the chair and closes the computer. It\u0027s a folding one like Granny had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was about to leave,\" his eyes settle on my chest. I feel bile rising. I can\u0027t do it. I can\u0027t let him ogle me. I feel the panic and hear the tearing. I tell myself it\u0027s only one man. I wipe my hands on my pants and smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe steps away from the desk, \"I\u0027m getting tired anyway. What\u0027s your name?.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"Lainy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grins, \"What do you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nurse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowns, \"In this building?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"I\u0027m here to deliver things to the farms.\" I have no idea what I\u0027m saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighs, \"I see.\" His face looks funny when I say the word farms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are things there?\" His eyes search mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, \"The vigilante killed a lot of people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile plays on the man\u0027s lips. Will sneaks up behind him and grabs him by the throat, but I put my hands out, \"Stop!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill holds him tight as he struggles. He is nothing compared to Will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a feeling about him and ask, \"Are you a rebel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes flash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decide to just go with it. We can kill him if we have to. I sigh and say, \"I\u0027m the vigilante.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe claws at Will\u0027s arm. Will releases him and gives me a look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at me intently, \"I\u0027m friends with Marshall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll my eyes, \"Well, he\u0027s a bastard, so that’s not a good thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man puts a hand up, \"I haven’t spoken to him in months. Last I heard, a vigilante from his camps was taking down those disgusting farms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turns and faces Will and they both laugh and hug. I don’t understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Al, what the hell? How did you end up here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man shakes his head, \"It\u0027s the best way to sabotage, from inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You two know each other?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey nod together, \"Allan here used to work the farm I was at.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAl patted him on his back, \"He was, by far, the worst inmate, ever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill\u0027s face grows serious, \"My sister is here somewhere with Bernie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllan grimaces, \"Bernie, that little shit? Oh God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach sinks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAl walks away from us to the door, \"Up two floors. You\u0027ll need weapons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull my gun. He looks at me, \"You really are the vigilante?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, \"I guess. They call me that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Phoenix girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowl, \"No. That flashy crow thing is not for me. I just want to stop them.\" I don’t say my dad but Will does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Michael is her father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAl winces, \"Oh. I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frown, \"For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, \"Your father is a very bad man. Was he always evil?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug, \"I think so. My mom ran with me when I was little.\" I lie and flash Will a look. I don’t know this man. I don’t want him to know I\u0027m a Gen baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill shakes his head. We enter the stairwell again. The dim lights are a welcome sight, compared to the constantly changing ones in the labs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe climb the stairs as Al whispers, \"Bernie has been allowed to come and go. We all figure he has something Michael wants. He is allowed a truck and a house on the outside. No one is allowed that. He\u0027s up Michael\u0027s ass all the time. If he has your sister, she might be…gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shudder and push harder up the stairs. \"This level is guarded. It’s Michael\u0027s personal lab.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crack the door and peek. There are lights on in several areas. \"At least four of them moving in there,\" I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go to the right…me and Al will go left,\" Will whispers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look back at him. His eyes tell me what I want to see; he\u0027s watching Allan just in case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sneak into the lab, hating the stupid flashing lights above me. Whoever thought of it, was an idiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swerve to the right and watch. No one notices the lights coming on. I\u0027ve noticed this about them all. They’ve gotten so accustomed to the lights that they don’t pay attention to them. They move around, making the lights move with them, like spotlights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see the ceiling lighting up to the left where Al and Will are walking. I peek around a desk to see Bernie. He\u0027s bent over a book. I stand up and tuck the gun in my back pocket. I walk to him like I\u0027m supposed to be here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks up; his face loses all its color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know the look on my face is scary. I can feel the rage simmering under my skin. I have an urge to pull the gun and fire, but I don’t. I watch his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks around, putting a hand up. I stop. He gets up, bringing the book with him. I stand next to a large shelf of books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whispers when he gets close, \"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI growl, \"We want her now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see something on his face that I want to smash off of it. He swallows, \"She is in the back lab, with your dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab his shirt, pulling his face down closer to mine, \"I will kill you, without making a fucking sound. Do you understand me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe winces, \"She was really sick. He saved her but it took a lot. She isn’t ready to be moved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy fingers slide up to his throat. I grip tightly, \"I am stronger than I look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swallows, I feel the lump of fear in his throat, \"I swear she is okay. I wouldn’t do anything to hurt her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lip twitches, \"We met Allan. He doesn\u0027t seem to think you\u0027re what you say you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his sweaty face, \"I swear, Em. I won\u0027t let them hurt her.\" I hear men talking. I step back into the shadows of the bookshelf. Bernie stands there shaking. The fear on his face worsens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA voice from my past fills the air around us, \"Bern, what\u0027s the solution? None of us can get her to tell us anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear fills his voice, \"Not sure. I still think the fever cooked her brain; she has damage we can\u0027t see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man I can\u0027t see makes a humming noise, \"I guess. There is that possibility. Well, she\u0027s your friend. What\u0027s the decision?\" he sounds exactly like my father did. I should jump out, I should attack, but I\u0027m scared. I don’t move. I freeze like I used to before. I want to sneak away like a coward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBernie winks at me with the eye the man can\u0027t see, \"I think I\u0027ll end her. She\u0027s a veg.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/born-to-fight-born-2/page-34.html","bookId":1605,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:57:06 PM"}
