{"id":76707,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"\u003cp\u003eMaude was just leaving the room and announced to the baron that Madelyne\u0027s bath was ready for her, as he\u0027d instructed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the door closed behind the servant, Madelyne said, \"I can\u0027t bathe in front of you, Duncan. Please go and swim in your lake while I—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve seen you often enough without your clothes on, Madelyne,\" Duncan said. He untied her braided belt, tossed it over one of the chairs, then proceeded to remove her bliaut and chainse as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But always in bed, Duncan, with the covers and…\" Her voice trailed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan chuckled. \"Get into your bath, love, before the water turns cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You swim in a freezing lake,\" Madelyne reminded him. Her husband was slowly edging her chemise up over her shoulders. \"Why do you do that?\" she asked, blushing enough to feel the heat in her cheeks. \"Do you like to swim when it\u0027s so cold?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne thought to turn his attention away from undressing her. But Duncan seemed capable of answering her question and stripping her at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t particularly enjoy it,\" Duncan answered. Duncan made short work of her undergarment, eager to get rid of the clothing that shielded her beauty from him. He knelt down in front of her and slowly removed her stockings and shoes, and then caressed a hot trail back to her waist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands made her sigh with pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why do you do it?\" Madelyne stammered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To toughen my mind and my body.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped touching her. Madelyne was disappointed. \"There are easier ways to toughen your body,\" Madelyne whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought she sounded hoarse. Madelyne tried to cover her br**sts by pulling her hair forward, frowning when she realized the length didn\u0027t do an adequate job. She twisted the ends of her hair, conveniently blocking his view of her breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan wouldn\u0027t let her hide from him. He stood up and gently pushed her hands away. His palms cupped the fullness of her br**sts while his thumbs made lazy circles around her pink nipples. Madelyne\u0027s toes curled into the rushes. She instinctively leaned forward, seeking more of his touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I kiss you, Madelyne, I won\u0027t let you have your bath. I can see the passion in your eyes. Can you feel how much I want you?\" He whispered to her in a voice that caressed as tenderly as his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne slowly nodded. \"I always want you, Duncan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe forced herself to turn around and walk over to the tub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan tried not to watch his wife. He had vowed to go slowly this night. He was going to make love to her without rushing, no matter how much the urge to throw her on the bed and love her wildly challenged him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was going to gentle her with soft words too. His plan was to force her to tell him how much she loved him. Duncan was uneasy. He needed to hear the words now that he\u0027d admitted to himself how much he loved her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan was determined to make her love him. And he was arrogant enough to believe that once he\u0027d wooed her, she wouldn\u0027t be able to deny him anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan smiled to himself. He was about to use her obsession with telling the truth to his advantage. He removed his tunic, then knelt down before the hearth to add another log to the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne washed quickly, worrying that Duncan would turn and watch her doing such an intimate task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she saw the humor in her predicament and laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan walked over to stand beside the tub. With his hands on his hips, he demanded to know what she found so amusing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t wearing his shirt now. Madelyne\u0027s heart started racing. She suddenly became breathless too. Oh, how he could so easily arouse her. \"I sleep beside you every night without a stitch of clothing and I really shouldn\u0027t be embarrassed now. That was why I was laughing,\" she added with a shrug that nearly drowned her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne stood and faced her husband, proving to herself and to him she wasn\u0027t embarrassed any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDroplets of water glistened against her skin. The ends of her hair were clumped together in wet locks. She had a mischievous look on her face. Duncan leaned down to kiss her once, on the top of her forehead, then again, on the bridge of her nose. He couldn\u0027t help himself. Madelyne was looking so magnificent and trying so nobly not to be shy with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she shivered, Duncan reached for the cloth Maude had left on one of the chairs. He wrapped the material around Madelyne, lifted her from the tub, and carried her over to the hearth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne stood with her back to the fire. She closed her eyes when Duncan\u0027s chest rubbed against her breasts. The heat from the blaze warmed her shoulders and Duncan\u0027s tender gaze warmed her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt cherished. It was such a wonderful feeling, she didn\u0027t offer any protest when Duncan began to dry her. At first he used the cloth to pat her skin, but when he\u0027d finished with her back, he suddenly pulled the edges of the material toward him, dragging her up against his chest. And then his mouth captured hers in a searing kiss. His tongue penetrated the treasure she offered him. Duncan let go of the cloth, cupped her buttocks, pulling her up against his hardness, his incredible heat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moaned with pleasure into his mouth, stroked his tongue with her own. Her hands caressed his back, but when her fingertips edged under the waistband of his pants, Duncan abruptly pulled away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take me to bed, Duncan,\" Madelyne pleaded. She tried to capture his mouth for another kiss. But Duncan deliberately eluded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In time, Madelyne,\" he promised her in a husky whisper. He kissed the tip of her chin, then slowly made his way down to her breasts. \"You\u0027re so beautiful,\" he told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to taste all of her. Duncan stroked one breast with his hand while he worshipped the other with his mouth, sucking until the nipple was a hard nub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tongue felt like hot velvet. Madelyne could barely stand up. When Duncan knelt down and began to rain hot, wet kisses down the length of her belly, she took a deep breath and forgot to let it out. His hands rubbed her thighs, moved between them, driving her to the brink of losing her control. He kissed a path along the length of her scar as his hands continued their sweet torment, stroking, caressing, adoring the very heat of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held her by her hips, and when his mouth began to kiss the soft mound of curls between her thighs, her knees did buckle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan wouldn\u0027t let her move. His mouth and his tongue tasted the moist heat he\u0027d created in her. She was as sweet as honey and as intoxicating as a fine wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne thought she was going to die from the pleasure. Her fingernails dug into Duncan\u0027s shoulder blades. She moaned a soft whimper. The primitive erotic sound nearly drove Duncan mad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slowly lowered Madelyne to the floor. His mouth claimed hers just as his fingers penetrated her tight, wet sheath. Madelyne arched against his hand, cried out his name when the splendor erupted inside her. Wave after wave of incredible pleasure washed over her, and through it all, Duncan held her close, whispering words of love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt like liquid gold in his arms, thought to tell him how much he pleased her, but couldn\u0027t seem to quit kissing him long enough to tell him anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan pulled away and quickly removed the rest of his clothes. He stretched out on his back then and pulled Madelyne on top of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew he was about to lose control. Duncan pushed her legs apart, trying not to be rough, and when she was straddling him, his hand began to stroke her wild again. Madelyne moaned his name, begged him with her hands and her mouth to end this torment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted her h*ps and thrust into her with one powerful surge. She was more than ready for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was so incredibly hot, so wet, so tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan let her capture him then. Madelyne arched her back until she surrounded all of him, and then began to move, with slow, instinctive motions that drove him crazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt as weak as a squire and as powerful as a warlord. Duncan held her by the sides of her hips, demanding her to move more forcefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found release before Madelyne did, but the sound and feel of him gave Madelyne her own blissful surrender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne collapsed against his chest. Duncan groaned but Madelyne was too exhausted, too satisfied to apologize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong minutes passed before either was capable of speaking. Madelyne\u0027s fingers stroked Duncan\u0027s chest. She loved the feel of his crisp hair, his smooth, hot skin, his wonderful scent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan slowly rolled with Madelyne until she was trapped underneath him. He moved to his side then, propped his head up with one elbow, and casually draped one heavy thigh over her legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne thought he looked most arrogant. He stared at her with such a smug expression on his face. A lock of hair had fallen forward to rest against his forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne was about to reach up and brush the hair back in place when Duncan spoke. \"I love you, Madelyne.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer hand froze in the air between them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne\u0027s eyes widened and it was then that Duncan realized what he\u0027d said to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t at all how he\u0027d planned it. She was supposed to tell him she loved him. He smiled over his own blunder while he patiently waited for her to recover from his admission and tell him how much she loved him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne couldn\u0027t believe he\u0027d said the words. His expression turned solemn, telling her he meant what he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to cry. Duncan didn\u0027t know what to make of that. \"Are you weeping because I\u0027ve told you I love you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne shook her head. \"No,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why are you so upset? I have just pleased you, haven\u0027t I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe actually sounded a little worried. Madelyne wiped the tears from her cheeks, bumping Duncan\u0027s chin. \"You have pleased me,\" she told him. \"I\u0027m so frightened, Duncan. You shouldn\u0027t love me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan sighed. He decided he\u0027d have to wait a few more minutes to get a decent explanation out of her. She was shivering too much to speak coherently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe really held his patience, but once he\u0027d carried Madelyne to their bed and they were under the covers, she snuggled up against him and didn\u0027t say a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you afraid?\" he asked. \"Is it so terrible for me to love you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was filled with tenderness and that made Madelyne cry again. \"There can be no hope for us. Duncan. The king will—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give us his blessing, Madelyne. Our king will have to approve this marriage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounded so sure of himself. She drew comfort from his confidence. \"Tell me why you think the king will side with you. Make me understand. I don\u0027t want to be frightened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan sighed. \"King William and I have known each other since we were young boys. He has many flaws, but he has proven himself to be an able leader. You dislike him because of the stories you\u0027ve heard from your uncle. And your uncle reflects only the attitudes of his church. The king has lost the support of the clergy because he took treasures from their monasteries. He has never been quick to replace any church official either. The clergy belittles our king because he doesn\u0027t bend to their dictates.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why do you think—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not interrupt me when I\u0027m instructing you,\" Duncan said. He softened his command by giving her a gentle squeeze. \"Though I don\u0027t mean to boast, in truth I\u0027ve helped our king unite the Scots and maintain a peaceful coexistence. The king knows my value. I\u0027ve a well-trained army he can call upon in time of need, Madelyne. He relies on my loyalty. I would never betray him. He knows that too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, Duncan, Louddon is his special friend,\" Madelyne interjected. \"Marta told me so and I\u0027ve also heard rumors from my uncle\u0027s friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is this Marta?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of the servants assigned to my uncle,\" Madelyne answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, then she must surely be as infallible as the pope,\" Duncan returned. \"Is that your way of thinking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not,\" Madelyne muttered. She tried to turn around to look at Duncan, but he wouldn\u0027t let her move. She settled back against his shoulder and said, \"My brother even boasts of his power over William.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me, wife, what you mean by special,\" Duncan commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne shook her head vehemently. \"I cannot say the words. It would be sinful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan sighed in exasperation. He knew well enough what the king\u0027s preferences were, had guessed long ago that Louddon was more than a clerk in William\u0027s court. He was surprised, however, that his innocent little wife would have such knowledge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will just have to trust me on this, Duncan, when I tell you it\u0027s a sinful pact between my brother and our king.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will not matter,\" Duncan returned. \"We\u0027ll not speak of this any longer, since it seems to embarrass you so. I know what you mean by special, Madelyne. Yet the king will not betray his barons. Honor is on my side in this feud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are we speaking about the same honor that got you tied to a post in Louddon\u0027s fortress perchance?\" Madelyne asked. \"You\u0027re so honorable, you trusted Louddon to honor the temporary truce, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a most carefully thought out plan,\" Duncan answered. His voice grated against Madelyne\u0027s ear. \"I never trusted your brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He could have killed you before your men gained entrance, Duncan,\" Madelyne returned. \"As for that matter, you could have frozen to death. I, of course, saved you. Honor had little to do with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan didn\u0027t argue with her. Madelyne was wrong in her assumptions, of course, but he didn\u0027t feel he needed to point out her error.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Louddon will use me to harm you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat comment didn\u0027t make any sense at all. \"Madelyne, there isn\u0027t a baron in England who hasn\u0027t heard about Adela. If the king turns his back on the truth, he\u0027ll have made his first foolish mistake. There are other loyal barons who will stand by me. We are all honor bound to our leader, aye, but he must also act with honor toward each of us. Otherwise our pledge of fealty means nothing. Have faith in me, Madelyne. Louddon cannot win this war. Trust me, wife, to know what\u0027s to be done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne thought about what he said for several minutes and then whispered, \"I\u0027ve always trusted you, ever since that night we slept together in your tent. You promised me you wouldn\u0027t touch me when I slept, and I believed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan smiled over the memory. \"Now do you realize how absurd it was for you to think I could take advantage without you knowing it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadelyne nodded. \"I am a very sound sleeper, Duncan,\" she teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Madelyne, I\u0027m not going to let you ignore our initial topic. I\u0027ve just vowed my love for you. Have you nothing to say to me in return?\" Duncan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you?\" He shouted the words back at her. His patience deserted him. Madelyne was supposed to tell him how much she loved him and why the hell she didn\u0027t know that infuriated him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/honor-s-splendour/page-34.html","bookId":1841,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:29:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:29:58 PM"}
