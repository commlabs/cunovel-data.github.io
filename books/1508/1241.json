Moreover, many of these people were hiding their aura so it was difficult for others to judge them based on that alone.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Brother Long, Brother Fei, it\u0027s quite rare for a little early Divine Sea brat to appear here.

Brother Long, Brother Fei, you’re both so strong and this little brother here is so weak. Now that there is actually an opponent who showed up that climbed so slowly and also has a low cultivation, won’t you look after this little brother of yours?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn order for the thin martial artist to be the one to challenge Lin Ming, he flattered again and again. He simply didn’t know who Lin Ming was. Although the twin hosts had introduced Lin Ming, the participants had all been busy crawling up the Divine Seal Altar at the time. Although they heard of him, they didn’t have an image of him in mind.
