Then the moss burst into flames and burned all the way down the street. Naturally Zabulon hadn\u0027t set it on fire deliberately, it was just that the opening of the portal had spilled out so much power that the moss couldn\u0027t assimilate it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Zabulon,\u0027 whispered Alisa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom out of the paving stones about five metres away a ray of violet light shot up into the sky. The flash blinded me and I automatically squeezed my eyes shut. When I looked in that direction again, there was a bluish-black bubble hanging in the grey mist, with something looking vaguely like a man clambering out of it – bristling with spiny scales. Zabulon had responded to the summons by travelling through the second or third level of the Twilight. The time we were moving in would have seemed as slow there as human time did to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suddenly had the old feeling of powerlessness that I thought I\u0027d come to terms with a long time ago. The powers that Zabulon or Gesar used so casually were so far beyond me that I simply couldn\u0027t comprehend them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Zabulon!\u0027 Still holding her hands behind her back, Alisa raced towards the monstrous creature and pressed herself against it, burying her face in the bristly scales. \u0027Help me, help me!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, Zabulon hadn\u0027t appeared in demonic form just to make an impression on me. In human form he wouldn\u0027t have survived a minute in the deep layers of the Twilight. And he\u0027d probably had to travel for hours, if not days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monster cast a baleful glance at me from the narrow slits of its eyes. A long forked tongue slithered out of its mouth and slid across Alisa\u0027s head, leaving a trail of white slime on her hair. A scaly hand with long claws took hold of Alisa by the chin and gently lifted up her head. Their eyes met. The exchange of information was brief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Little idiot!\u0027 the demon roared. The tongue withdrew into its mouth and the jaws clacked shut, just missing it. \u0027Greedy little idiot!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell. So much for my right to a third-degree intervention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe demon\u0027s short tail lashed Alisa across the legs, tearing the silk dress and knocking her to the ground. Its eyes flashed, the witch was enveloped in a blue glow and she froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo much for the help Alisa had wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027May I take my prisoner away, Zabulon?\u0027 I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monster stood there, swaying on its crooked paws, with the claws on its toes sliding in and out. Then it took a step and stood between me and the motionless witch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I ask you to confirm the legality of the arrest,\u0027 I said. \u0027Otherwise I shall be obliged to summon help.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe demon began transforming. The proportions of its body changed and its scales disappeared, its tail was drawn back into its body, and its penis stopped looking like a club studded with nails. Finally clothes appeared on Zabulon\u0027s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Wait a moment, Anton.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What for?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dark Magician\u0027s face remained inscrutable. Presumably in his demonic form he felt far more emotions, or at least he didn\u0027t feel any need to conceal them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I confirm the pledge made by Alisa.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027If this matter is not made official, the Day Watch will accept any magical intervention you make, up to and including the third degree.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to be utterly serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed. A promise like that from the head of the Day Watch . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Never trust the Dark Ones.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Any intervention up to and including the second degree.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Are you that eager to avoid a scandal?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Or do you need her for something?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tremor ran across Zabulon\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I need her. I love her.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I don\u0027t believe you.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027As the head of the Moscow Day Watch I ask you, watchman Anton, to settle this matter amicably. It is possible, since my ward Alisa Donnikova had not yet caused any significant harm to humans. As compensation for her attempt\u0027 – Zabulon emphasised the last word – \u0027to perform a magical intervention of the third degree, the Day Watch will accept any Light intervention that you may perform up to and including the second degree. I do not ask for this agreement to remain secret. I do not impose any restrictions on your actions. I confirm that for the offence she has committed Day Watch agent Alisa will be severely punished. May the Dark bear witness to my words.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA faint trembling. A rumbling below ground, the roar of an approaching hurricane. A tiny black ball appeared on Zabulon\u0027s open palm, spinning rapidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What do you say?\u0027 asked Zabulon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ran my tongue over my lips and looked at Alisa\u0027s magically frozen body. She was a real bitch, no doubt about it. And I had a personal score to settle with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe that was why I didn\u0027t feel like settling this business with a compromise. Maybe it had nothing to do with the risks of an agreement with the Dark. Alisa had tried to use the prism of power to extract part of the life energy from humans. That was third- or fourth-degree magic. I\u0027d be able to perform a second-degree intervention, and that was a very big deal. A genuinely massive intervention. A city without a single crime for a whole day. A brilliant and unequivocally good intervention. How many times in the history of the Night Watch had we needed to make a third- or fourth-degree intervention but didn\u0027t have the right, and we\u0027d had to just go ahead and risk it, terrified by how the other side might respond?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now I could have a second-degree intervention for free, or as good as.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027May the Light bear witness to my words,\u0027 I said, and held my hand out to Zabulon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the first time I\u0027d ever called on the primordial powers to witness anything. I only knew it didn\u0027t require any special incantations. And there was no real guarantee that the Light would deign to become involved in our affairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA petal of white flame flared up on my open palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabulon flinched, but he didn\u0027t take his hand away. We sealed the agreement with a handshake, the Dark and the Light coming together. I felt a stab of pain, like a blunt needle piercing my flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027The agreement is sealed,\u0027 said the Dark Magician.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned too. He had also felt the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Do you hope to gain some advantage from this?\u0027 I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Of course. I always hope to gain some advantage from everything. And I usually do.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least Zabulon wasn\u0027t obviously delighted with the deal we\u0027d made. Whatever he might be hoping for as a result of our agreement, he wasn\u0027t completely certain of success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ve found out what the courier brought to Moscow from the east and why.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZabulon smiled gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Excellent. I find the situation trying, and it is a great relief to know that now my concern will be shared by others.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Zabulon, has there ever been a single case when the Night Watch and the Day Watch collaborated? Genuine collaboration, not just catching violators and psychopaths?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No. In any collaboration one side or the other would be the loser.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I\u0027ll bear that in mind.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You do that.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe even bowed politely to each other. As if we weren\u0027t two magicians on opposite sides, an adept of the Light and a servant of the Dark, but two acquaintances who got on perfectly well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Zabulon returned to Alisa\u0027s motionless body, lifted it easily and threw it across his shoulder. I was expecting him to withdraw from the Twilight, but instead the Dark Ones\u0027 leader gave me a condescending smile and stepped into the portal. It remained visible for a moment, and then began to fade. I was going a different way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only then that I realised how tired I felt. The Twilight likes it when we enter it, and it likes it even more when we\u0027re agitated. The Twilight\u0027s insatiable, glad to take on anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chose a spot where there weren\u0027t many people and tore myself out of my shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eyes of the people walking by swung away as usual. You meet us so often during the day, you humans . . . Light Ones and Dark Ones, magicians and werewolves, witches and healers. You look at us, but you\u0027re not allowed to see us. May it always be that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can live for hundreds and thousands of years. We\u0027re very hard to kill. And for us the problems that make up human life are no more than a schoolboy\u0027s distress at his bad handwriting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there\u0027s a downside to everything. I\u0027d gladly trade places with you humans. Take this ability to see the shadow and enter the Twilight. Take the protection of the Watch and the ability to influence people\u0027s minds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGive me back the peace of mind that I have lost for ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone jostled me to get me out of the way. A tough-looking man with a shaved head, a mobile at his belt and a gold chain round his neck. He looked me up and down disdainfully, muttered something through his teeth and headed on down the street. The girlfriend clinging to his arm made a rather unsuccessful attempt to imitate his glance, the kind that petty gangsters use for jerks who are a soft touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed out loud. Yes, I probably looked a sight! Standing stock still in the middle of the street, apparently gawping at a stand covered with ugly bronze figurines, wooden matryoshka dolls with politicians\u0027 faces and fake Khokhloma painted boxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had the right to shake up the entire street. To perform a mass remoralisation – then the man with the shaven head would take a job as an orderly in a mental hospital and his girlfriend would head for the train station to go to see the old mother she\u0027d managed to forget, somewhere out in the sticks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to do Good – my hands were just itching to do it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was why I mustn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heart might be pure and the hands might be hot, but the head still had to be cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was an ordinary, rank-and-file Other. I didn\u0027t have the power granted to Gesar or Zabulon, and I never would have. Maybe that was why I took a different view of what was happening. And I couldn\u0027t even use this unexpected gift – the right to use Light magic. That would be joining in the game that was being played out above my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy only chance was to drop out of the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd take Svetlana with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in the process ruin the operation the Night Watch had been preparing for so long. To stop being a field agent of the Watch. Become an ordinary Light Magician, using mere crumbs of my powers. That was the best case, of course – in the worst case scenario it was the eternal Twilight for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, today at midnight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere? And who? Whose Book of Destiny would the sorceress open? Olga had said they\u0027d been planning the operation for twelve years. Twelve years spent searching for a Great Sorceress who could use the little piece of chalk that had been kept safe all that time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut wait!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could have howled at my own stupidity. Higher magicians plan many moves ahead. There are no accidents in their games. There are queens and there are pawns. But there are no superfluous pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEgor!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy who had almost become a victim of illegal hunting. Who\u0027d entered the Twilight in a state of mind that had nudged him towards the Dark Side. The boy whose destiny was still not determined, whose aura still had all the colours of a child\u0027s. A unique case. I\u0027d been stunned when I saw him for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d been stunned, and then had forgotten. The moment I discovered that the kid\u0027s powers had been artificially increased by the boss – to mislead the Dark Ones and allow Egor to offer at least some resistance to the vampires. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-67.html","bookId":2623,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM"}
