{"id":10270,"no":99,"title":"CHAPTER 99","content":"“I said I’d dig worms for you too, if you wanted.”\u0026nbsp; Lommy made a disgusted face. “If it wasn’t for my leg, I’d hunt us some boars.”\u0026nbsp; “Some boars,” she mocked. “You need a boarspear to hunt boars, and horses and dogs, and men to flush the boar from its lair.” Her father had hunted boar in the wolfswood with Robb and Jon. Once he even took Bran, but never Arya, even though she was older. Septa Mordane said boar hunting was not for ladies, and Mother only promised that when she was older she might have her own hawk. She was older now, but if she had a hawk she’d eat it.\u0026nbsp; “What do you know about hunting boars?” said Hot Pie.\u0026nbsp; “More than you.”\u0026nbsp; Gendry was in no mood to hear it. “Quiet, both of you, I need to think what to do.” He always looked pained when he tried to think, like it hurt him something fierce.\u0026nbsp; “Yield,” Lommy said.\u0026nbsp; “I told you to shut up about the yielding. We don’t even know who’s in there. Maybe we can steal some food.”\u0026nbsp; “Lommy could steal, if it wasn’t for his leg,” said Hot Pie. “He was a thief in the city.”\u0026nbsp; “A bad thief,” Arya said, “or he wouldn’t have got caught.”\u0026nbsp; Gendry squinted up at the sun. “Evenfall will be the best time to sneak in. I’ll go scout come dark.”\u0026nbsp; “No, I’ll go,” Arya said. “You’re too noisy.”\u0026nbsp; Gendry got that look on his face. “We’ll both go.”\u0026nbsp; “Arry should go,” said Lommy. “He’s sneakier than you are.”\u0026nbsp; “We’ll both go, I said.”\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; “But what if you don’t come back? Hot Pie can’t carry me by himself, you know he can’t...”\u0026nbsp; “And there’s wolves,” Hot Pie said. “I heard them last night, when I had the watch. They sounded close.”\u0026nbsp; Arya had heard them too. She’d been asleep in the branches of an elm, but the howling had woken her. She’d sat awake for a good hour, listening to them, prickles creeping up her spine.\u0026nbsp; “And you won’t even let us have a fire to keep them off,” Hot Pie said. “It’s not right, leaving us for the wolves.”\u0026nbsp; “No one is leaving you,” Gendry said in disgust. “Lommy has his spear if the wolves come, and you’ll be with him. We’re just going to go see, that’s all; we’re coming back.”\u0026nbsp; “Whoever it is, you should yield to them,” Lommy whined. “I need some potion for my leg, it hurts bad.”\u0026nbsp; “If we see any leg potion, we’ll bring it,” Gendry said. “Arry, let’s go, I want to get near before the sun is down. Hot Pie, you keep Weasel here, I don’t want her following.”\u0026nbsp; “Last time she kicked me.”\u0026nbsp; “I’ll kick you if you don’t keep her here.” Without waiting for an answer, Gendry donned his steel helm and walked off.\u0026nbsp; Arya had to scamper to keep up. Gendry was five years older and a foot taller than she was, and long of leg as well. For a while he said nothing, just plowed on through the trees with an angry look on his face, making too much noise. But finally he stopped and said, “I think Lommy’s going to die.”\u0026nbsp; She was not surprised. Kurz had died of his wound, and he’d been a lot stronger than Lommy. Whenever it was Arya’s turn to help carry him, she could feel how warm his skin was, and smell the stink off his leg. “Maybe we could find a maester...”\u0026nbsp; “You only find maesters in castles, and even if we found one, he wouldn’t dirty his hands on the likes of Lommy.” Gendry ducked under a low-hanging limb.\u0026nbsp; “That’s not true.” Maester Luwin would have helped anyone who came to him, she was certain.\u0026nbsp; “He’s going to die, and the sooner he does it, the better for the rest of us. We should just leave him, like he says. If it was you or me hurt, you know he’d leave us.” They scrambled down a steep cut and up the other side, using roots for handholds. “I’m sick of carrying him, and I’m sick of all his talk about yielding too. If he could stand up, I’d knock his teeth in. Lommy’s no use to anyone. That crying girl’s no use either.”\u0026nbsp; “You leave Weasel alone, she’s just scared and hungry is all.” Arya glanced back, but the girl was not following for once. Hot Pie must have grabbed her, like Gendry had told him.\u0026nbsp; “She’s no use,” Gendry repeated stubbornly. “Her and Hot Pie and Lommy, they’re slowing us down, and they’re going to get us killed. You’re the only one of the bunch who’s good for anything. Even if you are a girl.”\u0026nbsp; Arya froze in her steps. “I’m not a girl!”\u0026nbsp; “Yes you are. Do you think I’m as stupid as they are?”\u0026nbsp; “No, you’re stupider. The Night’s Watch doesn’t take girls, everyone knows that.”\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; “That’s true. I don’t know why Yoren brought you, but he must have had some reason. You’re still a girl.”\u0026nbsp; “I am not!”\u0026nbsp; “Then pull out your cock and take a piss. Go on.”\u0026nbsp; “I don’t need to take a piss. If I wanted to I could.”\u0026nbsp; “Liar. You can’t take out your cock because you don’t have one. I never noticed before when there were thirty of us, but you always go off in the woods to make your water. You don’t see Hot Pie doing that, nor me neither. If you’re not a girl, you must be some eunuch.”\u0026nbsp; “You’re the eunuch.”\u0026nbsp; “You know I’m not.” Gendry smiled. “You want me to take out my cock and prove it? I don’t have anything to hide.”\u0026nbsp; “Yes you do,” Arya blurted, desperate to escape the subject of the cock she didn’t have. “Those gold cloaks were after you at the inn, and you won’t tell us why.”\u0026nbsp; “I wish I knew. I think Yoren knew, but he never told me. Why did you think they were after you, though?”\u0026nbsp; Arya bit her lip. She remembered what Yoren had said, the day he had hacked off her hair. This lot, half o’ them would turn you over to the queen quick as spit for a pardon and maybe a few silvers. The other half’d do the same, only they’d rape you first. Only Gendry was differ- ent, the queen wanted him too. “I’ll tell you if you’ll tell me,” she said warily.\u0026nbsp; “I would if I knew, Arry... is that really what you’re called, or do you have some girl’s name?”\u0026nbsp; Arya glared at the gnarled root by her feet. She realized that the pretense was done. Gendry knew, and she had nothing in her pants to convince him otherwise. She could draw Needle and kill him where he stood, or else trust him. She wasn’t certain she’d be able to kill him, even if she tried; he had his own sword, and he was a lot stronger. All that was left was the truth. “Lommy and Hot Pie can’t know,” she said.\u0026nbsp; “They won’t,” he swore. “Not from me.”\u0026nbsp; “Arya.” She raised her eyes to his. “My name is Arya. Of House Stark.”\u0026nbsp; “Of House It took him a moment before he said, “The King’s Hand was named Stark. The one they killed for a traitor.”\u0026nbsp; “He was never a traitor. He was my father.”\u0026nbsp; Gendry’s eyes widened. “So that’s why you thought.”\u0026nbsp; She nodded. “Yoren was taking me home to Winterfell.”\u0026nbsp; “I... you’re highborn then, a... you’ll be a lady...”\u0026nbsp; Arya looked down at her ragged clothes and bare feet, all cracked and callused. She saw the dirt under her nails, the scabs on her elbows, the scratches on her hands. Septa Mordane wouldn’t even know me, I bet. Sansa might, but she’d pretend not to. “My mother’s a lady, and my sister, but I never was.”\u0026nbsp; “Yes you were. You were a lord’s daughter and you lived in a castle, didn’t you? And you... gods be good, I never...” All of a sudden Gendry seemed uncertain, almost afraid. “All that about\u0026nbsp; cocks, I never should have said that. And I been pissing in front of you and everything, I I beg your pardon, m’lady.”\u0026nbsp; “Stop that!” Arya hissed. Was he mocking her?\u0026nbsp; “I know my courtesies, m’lady,” Gendry said, stubborn as ever. “Whenever highborn girls came into the shop with their fathers, my master told me I was to bend the knee, and speak only when they spoke to me, and call them m’lady.”\u0026nbsp; “If you start calling me m’lady, even Hot Pie is going to notice. And you better keep on pissing the same way too.”\u0026nbsp; “As m’lady commands.”\u0026nbsp; Arya slammed his chest with both hands.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1522/45510.html","bookId":1301,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:57:51 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:57:51 AM"}
