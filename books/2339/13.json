He looked at his watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You better not be wasting my time, Reacher,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked on north. The sun was dropping away from overhead, but the heat was still fierce. I didn\u0027t know how Finlay could wear a tweed jacket. And a moleskin vest. I led him over to the village green. We crossed the grass and leaned up on the statue of old Caspar Teale, side by side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They cut his balls off, right?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. Looked at me, waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" I said. \"So the question is this: did you find his balls?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said. \"We went over the whole place. Ourselves and the medical examiner. They weren\u0027t there. His testicles are missing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled as he said it. He was recovering his cop\u0027s sense of humor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" I said. \"That\u0027s what I needed to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile widened. Reached his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" he said. \"Do you know where they are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When\u0027s the autopsy?\" I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was still smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His autopsy won\u0027t help,\" he said. \"They were cut off. They\u0027re not connected to him anymore. They weren\u0027t there. They\u0027re missing. So how can they find them at his autopsy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not his autopsy,\" I said. \"Her autopsy. His wife\u0027s. When they check what she ate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinlay stopped smiling. Went quiet. Just looked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talk, Reacher,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" I said. \"That\u0027s why we came out here, remember? So answer another question for me. How many homicides have they had in Margrave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought about it. Shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None,\" he said. \"At least, not for maybe thirty years or so. Not since voter registration days, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now you\u0027ve had four in four days,\" I said. \"And pretty soon you\u0027ll find the fifth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fifth?\" he said. \"Who\u0027s the fifth?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hubble,\" I said. \"My brother, this Sherman Stoller guy, the two Morrisons and Hubble makes five. No homicides in thirty years and now you\u0027ve got five all at once. That can\u0027t be any kind of a coincidence, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No way,\" he said. \"Of course not. They\u0027re linked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right,\" I said. \"Now I\u0027ll tell you some more links. But first of all, you got to understand something, right? I was just passing through here. On Friday and Saturday and Sunday right up to the time those prints came through on my brother, I wasn\u0027t paying the slightest bit of attention to anything at all. I was just figuring I\u0027d wait around and get the hell out of here as soon as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I was told stuff,\" I said. \"Hubble told me things in Warburton, but I didn\u0027t pay a lot of attention. I wasn\u0027t interested in him, OK? He told me things, and I didn\u0027t follow them up with him and I probably don\u0027t recall some of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like what things?\" Finlay said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I told him the things I remembered. I started the same way Hubble had started. Trapped inside some kind of a racket, terrorized by a threat against himself and his wife. A threat consisting of the same things, word for word, that Finlay had just seen for himself that morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure about that?\" he said. \"Exactly the same?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Word for word,\" I said. \"Totally identical. Nailed to the wall, balls cut off, the wife forced to eat the balls, then they get their throats cut. Word-for-word identical, Finlay. So unless we got two threateners at the same time in the same place making the exact same threat, that\u0027s another link.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So Morrison was inside the same scam as Hubble?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Owned and operated by the same people,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I told him Hubble had been talking to an investigator. And I told him the investigator had been talking to Sherman Stoller, whoever he had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who was the investigator?\" he asked. \"And where does Joe fit in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joe was the investigator,\" I said. \"Hubble told me the tall guy with the shaved head was an investigator, trying to get him free.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What sort of an investigator was your brother?\" Finlay said. \"Who the hell was he working for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"Last I heard he was working for the Treasury Department.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinlay pushed off the statue and started walking back north.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got to make some calls,\" he said. \"Time to go to work on this thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Walk slow,\" I said. \"I haven\u0027t finished yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFINLAY WAS ON THE SIDEWALK. I WAS IN THE ROAD, STAYING clear of the low awnings in front of every store. There was no traffic on the street to worry about. Monday, two o\u0027clock in the afternoon, and the town was deserted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know Hubble\u0027s dead?\" Finlay asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I told him how I knew. He thought about it. He agreed with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he was talking to an investigator?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. Stopped outside the barbershop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"They didn\u0027t know about that. If they had, they\u0027d have got to him much earlier. Thursday at the latest. I figure they made the decision to waste him Friday, about five o\u0027clock. Because you pulled him in with the phone number in Joe\u0027s shoe. They figured he couldn\u0027t be allowed to talk to cops or prison guards. So they set it up with Spivey. But Spivey\u0027s boys blew it, so they tried over again. His wife said he got a call to wait at home today. They were setting him up for a second attempt. Looks like it worked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinlay nodded slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit,\" he said. \"He was the only link we had to exactly what the hell is going on here. You should have hit on him while you had the chance, Reacher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Finlay,\" I said. \"If I\u0027d known the dead guy was Joe, I\u0027d have hit on him so hard, you\u0027d have heard him yelling all the way over here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just grunted. We moved over and sat together on the bench under the barbershop window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I asked him what Pluribus was,\" I said. \"He wouldn\u0027t answer. He said there were ten local people involved in the scam, plus hired help in from the outside when necessary. And he said the scam is vulnerable until something happens on Sunday. Exposed, somehow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happens on Sunday?\" Finlay asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He didn\u0027t tell me,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you didn\u0027t press him?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t very interested,\" I said. \"I told you that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he gave you no idea what the scam is all about?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No idea,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he say who these ten people are?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ, Reacher, you\u0027re a big help, you know that?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Finlay,\" I said. \"I thought Hubble was just some asshole. If I could go back and do it again, I\u0027d do it a lot different, believe me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ten people?\" he said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not counting himself,\" I said. \"Not counting Sherman Stoller, either. But I assume he was counting Chief Morrison.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great,\" Finlay said. \"That only leaves me another nine to find.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll find one of them today,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE BLACK PICKUP I\u0027D LAST SEEN LEAVING ENO\u0027S PARKING lot pulled up short at the opposite curb. It waited there, motor running. The Kliner kid leaned his head on his forearm and stared out of the window at me from across the street. Finlay didn\u0027t see him. He was looking down at the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should be thinking about Morrison,\" I said to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about him?\" he said. \"He\u0027s dead, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But dead how?\" I said. \"What should that be saying to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Somebody making an example of him?\" he said. \"A message?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Correct, Finlay,\" I said. \"But what had he done wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Screwed something up, I guess,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Correct, Finlay,\" I said again. \"He was told to cover up what went down at the warehouse Thursday night. That was his task for the day. He was up there at midnight, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was?\" Finlay said. \"You said that was a bullshit story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"He didn\u0027t see me up there. That part was the bullshit story. But he was up there himself. He saw Joe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He did?\" Finlay said. \"How do you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First time he saw me was Friday, right?\" I said. \"In the office? He was staring at me like he\u0027d seen me before, but he couldn\u0027t place where. That was because he\u0027d seen Joe. He noticed a resemblance. Hubble said the same thing. He said I reminded him of his investigator.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So Morrison was there?\" Finlay said. \"Was he the shooter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t figure it that way,\" I said. \"Joe was a reasonably smart guy. He wouldn\u0027t let a fat idiot like Morrison shoot him. The shooter must have been somebody else. I can\u0027t figure Morrison for the maniac, either. That much physical exertion would have dropped him with a heart attack. I think he was the third guy. The clean-up guy. But he didn\u0027t search Joe\u0027s shoes. And because of that, Hubble got hauled in. That got somebody mad. It meant they had to waste Hubble, so Morrison was wasted as a punishment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some punishment,\" Finlay said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Also a message,\" I said. \"So think about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think about what?\" he said. \"Wasn\u0027t a message for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So who was it a message for?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is any such message for?\" he said. \"The next guy in line, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See why I was worried who was going to be the next chief?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinlay dropped his head again and stared at the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ,\" he said. \"You think the next chief will be in the scam?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got to be,\" I said. \"Why would they have Morrison inside? Not for his wonderful personality, right? They had him inside because they need the chief on board. Because that\u0027s useful to them in some particular way. So they wouldn\u0027t waste Morrison unless they had a replacement ready. And whoever it is, we\u0027re looking at a very dangerous guy. He\u0027ll be going in there with Morrison\u0027s example staring him in the face. Somebody will have just whispered to him: see what we did to Morrison? That\u0027s what we\u0027ll do to you if you screw up the way he did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So who is it?\" Finlay said. \"Who\u0027s going to be the new chief?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I was asking you,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWE SAT QUIET ON THE BENCH OUTSIDE THE BARBERSHOP FOR a moment. Enjoyed the sun creeping in under the edge of the striped awning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s you, me and Roscoe,\" I said. \"Right now, the only safe thing is to assume everybody else is involved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why Roscoe?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lots of reasons,\" I said. \"But mainly because she worked hard to get me out of Warburton. Morrison wanted me in there as a fall guy for Thursday night, right? So if Roscoe was inside the scam, she\u0027d have left me in there. But she got me out. She pulled in the exact opposite direction from Morrison. So if he was bent, she isn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me. Grunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only three of us?\" he said. \"You\u0027re a cautious guy, Reacher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bet your ass I\u0027m a cautious guy, Finlay,\" I said. \"People are getting killed here. One of them was my only brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stood up from the bench on the sidewalk. Across the street, the Kliner kid killed his motor and got out of the pickup. Started walking slowly over. Finlay rubbed his face with his hands, like he was washing without water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what now?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got things to do,\" I said. \"You need to get Roscoe on one side and fill her in with the details, OK? Tell her to take a lot of care. Then you need to make some calls and find out from Washington what Joe was doing down here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" Finlay said. \"What about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded across at the Kliner kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to have a talk with this guy,\" I said. \"He keeps looking at me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo things happened as the Kliner kid came near. First, Finlay left in a hurry. He just strode off north without another word. Second, I heard the barbershop blinds coming down in the window behind me. I glanced around. There could have been nobody else on the planet except for me and the Kliner kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp close, the kid was an interesting study. He was no lightweight. Probably six-two, maybe one ninety, shot through with some kind of a restless energy. There was a lot of intelligence in his eyes, but there was also some kind of an eerie light burning in there. His eyes told me this probably wasn\u0027t the most rational character I was ever going to meet in my whole life. He came close and stood in front of me. Just stared at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re trespassing,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is your sidewalk?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It sure is,\" the kid said. \"My daddy\u0027s Foundation paid for every inch of it. Every brick. But I\u0027m not talking about the sidewalk. I\u0027m talking about Miss Roscoe. She\u0027s mine. She\u0027s mine, right from when I first saw her. She\u0027s waiting for me. Five years, she\u0027s been waiting for me, until the time is right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gazed back at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You understand English?\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid tensed up. He was just about hopping from foot to foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a reasonable guy,\" I said. \"First time Miss Roscoe tells me she wants you instead of me, I\u0027m out of here. Until then, you back off. Understand that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid was boiling. But then he changed. It was like he was operated by a remote control and somebody had just hit a button and switched the channel. He relaxed and shrugged and smiled a wide, boyish smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"OK,\" he said. \"No hard feelings, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stuck out his hand to shake on it and he nearly fooled me. Right at the last split second I pulled my own hand back a fraction and closed around his knuckles, not his palm. It\u0027s an old army trick. They go to shake your hand, but they\u0027re aiming to crush it. Some big macho ritual. The way out is to be ready. You pull back a fraction and you squeeze back. You\u0027re squeezing their knuckles, not the meat of their palm. Their grip is neutralized. If you catch it right, you can\u0027t lose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe started crushing, but he never stood a chance. He was going for the steady squeeze, so he could stare into my eyes while I sweated it out. But he never got near. I crunched his knuckles once, then twice, a little harder, and then I dropped his hand and turned away. I was a good sixty yards north before I heard the truck start up. It rumbled south and its noise was lost in the buzz of the heat. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/killing-floor-jack-reacher-1/page-13.html","bookId":2339,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:04 AM"}
