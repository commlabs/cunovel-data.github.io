Ripples appeared on the surface, spreading out. It was finally time for the smelting trial disciples to return through the transmission array.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It’s time. I wonder just what the disciples who went in have managed to obtain.” Gold Evenmoon smiled, and the other martial artists present also appeared expectant. Normally, no more than 10% of the smelting trial disciples that entered the God Beast Mystic Realm would perish. Compared to the harvests that could be obtained, this was a necessary sacrifice. After all, the four God Beast Clans had a new batch of junior disciples every 20 or so years. Although it was a massive loss for some to die, that wasn’t enough to affect the destiny of their clans. Moreover, geniuses required life or death adventures in order to grow.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the ripples became increasingly intense, the first wave of disciples appeared. These people all seemed glum and spiritless. Some disciples even had visible wounds. They had clearly had a hard time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHuo Violentstone’s eyebrows shot up. An ominous premonition appeared in his heart. Gold Evenmoon also stood up.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHuo Violentstone asked, “Was there a change in the mystic realm?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Ancient Dragon Clan disciples looked over at Huo Violentstone with dazed eyes upon hearing this question. They looked at each other, clearly not knowing what to say.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Was there a problem? Did several people die?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAll the Elders stood up, each of them deeply frowning. It was clear that some great event had occurred, otherwise it was impossible for so many people to be involved.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Around 20 disciples died; we’re not sure of the exact number.” The Ancient Dragon Clan’s Dragon Eight said in a stammering voice. Dragon Eight was a Divine Sea disciple and could also be considered a vice captain of the Ancient Dragon Clan squad that went in this time. Although Dragon One would receive the main punishment as the captain, Dragon One hadn’t reappeared ever since he dove into the black swamp. They had sent an Iron Dragon Command but there still wasn’t a reply. It was possible that Dragon One’s fate was more perilous than they thought.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThus, the responsibility of this debacle would be assumed by the several vice captains.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“20!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eGold Evenmoon was immensely shocked. This was absolutely a great matter! Even Huo Violentstone became nervous. His eyes wandered over the crowd, looking for Lin Ming and Huo Clearheart. Especially Lin Ming – his cultivation was limited, so if something so massive happened, would he still be able to live?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What happened in there?” Gold Evenmoon hurriedly asked.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It was… an Asura King. We came across an Asura King as it was going through its demonic tribulation. But, the Asura King was just far too strong. All of the disciples gathered together to attack it, but we failed to kill it in the end. Instead, we suffered critical losses and it’s likely that 60% of the disciples have died.” Dragon 12 said with a dose of shame. He was also a vice captain of the squad, and this sort of defeat upon defeat was truly a loss of face. It proved just how incompetent the decision maker had been.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“What!? 60% of the disciples! Gold Skyedge!? Just what the hell kind of sickness came over him!? The clan gave him so many resources and treasures and had him take the lead, but he actually issued such a preposterous order!?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eGold Evenmoon said in an apoplectic rage. The Gold Skyedge he referred to was naturally Dragon One. He didn’t think that anything would happen to Dragon One. Dragon One was the strongest out of all the disciples of the four clans who had gone in, so if anyone died it shouldn’t have been him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Dragon One, he…” As Dragon One was mentioned, Dragon Eight and Dragon 12 both had ugly complexions. They eyed each other, motioning for the other to speak. Finally, no one said anything at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eGold Evenmoon felt his heart thump in his chest. Dragon One was the greatest talent that his Gold Family had produced in the last 1000 years, and also the most outstanding disciple of the Ancient Dragon Clan for the last 200 years. Although Gold Evenmoon had been yelling at Dragon One just now, if there really had been something that happened to him, then the losses would be unimaginable!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eDragon Eight and Dragon 12 didn’t reply.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThen, a light flashed and more disciples were transmitted out.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHuo Violentstone swept an eye over the newcomers and simultaneously saw Lin Ming and Huo Clearheart arrive. In addition, even the weakest Yan Littlemoon was still perfectly safe. He finally let out a long breath of relief. Everything was okay!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Coming back alive is great, it’s great!” Huo Violentstone said, his palms a bit sweaty. At this time, he didn’t care what harvests they had. It could be said that their coming back alive was the greatest harvest of all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eGold Evenmoon also swept through the crowd. When he didn’t find Dragon One, his complexion became thoroughly gloomy. After several more breaths of time, a few more disciples were sent out. And at this time, the fluctuating ripples of the transmission array began to die down. This was proof that no more disciples would be passing through the transmission array.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn other words, Dragon One… had perished!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe most outstanding young genius that the Ancient Dragon Clan had produced in the last 200 years, who had high hopes of becoming a Holy Lord level character, whose cultivation reached the middle Divine Sea realm, whose strength far surpassed all others’, and who also had multiple life saving methods, had actually died in the God Beast Mystic Realm!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis sort of matter had likely not occurred in the last 10,000 years!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Who killed Dragon One!? Was it the Asura King!?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eGold Evenmoon wildly growled, his eyes bloodshot. As he looked around he was like a wild beast. In his opinion, although Dragon One wasn’t the Asura King’s match, he should still have had the ability to escape, especially amongst so many other people. Could he have been tripped or stopped by someone, preventing him from escaping?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming was watching from the side. He remained with an indifferent look on his face upon meeting Gold Evenmoon’s bloodthirsty eyes. It was indeed far too difficult to find evidence of who killed who in the God Beast Mystic Realm, so he didn’t fear anything at all. As for some special tracing mark being left on the killer, Lin Ming also asked Mo Eversnow to look over him and she assured him everything was okay. In this situation, as long as Lin Ming insisted it had nothing to do with him then everything would be okay.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHuo Violentstone also realized an accident had occurred to Dragon One. Normally, with his personality, he would have been gloating to Gold Evenmoon and even mocking him for several rounds, but with the Ancient Phoenix Clan also having lost several disciples, he wasn’t in the mood to do so. He only lightly shook his head and turned to his disciples, saying, “What did you brats obtain?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe remaining disciples all took out the treasures that they obtained in the mystic realm for Huo Violentstone to see. Yan Littlemoon and Lin Ming took out their black coral. The value of this treasure wasn’t enough to make up for the cost of the violet sun stones for entering the God Beast Mystic Realm.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm… your harvest is alright.” Huo Violentstone nodded. He was satisfied enough that Lin Ming had emerged alive.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eXiao Ping, the one with the highest cultivation of the Ancient Phoenix Clan disciples, had actually found something quite valuable. It was a bit of phoenix guide grass. Phoenix guide grass was a type of spirit grass that grew alongside a phoenix. It was extremely valuable and was even useful for a Holy Lord.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBy all reasoning, there hadn’t been a God Beast in the God Beast Mystic Realm for countless hundreds of millions of years, so any phoenix guide grass should have already withered away. But, the phoenix guide grass that Xiao Ping found was actually sealed within a piece of wood spirit jade and preserved well, just like an insect in amber.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eXiao Ping’s harvest was naturally praised by the Protectors behind Huo Violentstone. With their status, they had to flatter Xiao Ping. After all, Xiao Ping was destined to become a high level figure of the Ancient Phoenix Clan.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut Lin Ming looked on indifferently. This Xiao Ping was not any sort of good or righteous fellow. When the disciples of the Ancient Phoenix Clan had been besieged by mystic realm demons and even some with 10,000 plus year cultivations, he had waited for the time when one of his teammates had died and then escaped by himself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Let’s go. We’re returning to the Ancient Phoenix Clan.” Huo Violentstone lightly sighed. Although the losses were serious this time, this was also the fate of those that chose to walk down the road of martial arts. There was nothing else to say.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, Lin Ming said with a true essence sound transmission, “Honorable Master, this disciple does not wish to return to the Phoenix Clan for the time being. I wish to go out and adventure a bit.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe supreme dragon bone could not be revealed, and absorbing it was also a very long and strenuous process. Lin Ming didn’t plan on absorbing it within the clan. He wasn’t even able to tell Huo Violentstone about it. After all, the supreme dragon bone was a type of treasure that even a World King would go mad with envy for. If Huo Violentstone found out, then even maintaining their current relationship would be more than he expected. It could be said that in some situations, not even the ties between a father and son could be trusted, much less the fact that he was not a direct descendant of the Huo Family to begin with.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm? You want to go out and adventure?” Huo Violentstone frowned. There were indeed many disciples of the Ancient Phoenix Clan that went out adventuring to gain experience, but now wasn’t a good time for Lin Ming to do so. “Lin Ming, you aren’t even at the Divine Sea. Do you know how many masters exist in the Divine Realm? If you are not careful and stumble into some ordinary Divine Transformation realm martial artist, even they will be enough to kill you! Moreover, it is almost time for you to attack the eighth stage of Life Destruction. If you return to my Huo Family we can provide you with many resources to assist you, and there is even the Sacred Flame Testament which you can meditate over. There is even… well, I was planning on arranging a wedding for you. You two can be considered a young golden couple, perfectly suited for each other. A marriage like this is definitely a good thing!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Huo Violentstone spoke to here, he inadvertently glanced at Yan Littlemoon, who was standing beside Lin Ming. His eyes flashed with a barely traceable happiness. Although this happiness seemed simple, there was actually a mischievous and devilish meaning to it, as if he were up to no good.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eYan Littlemoon froze. From the start, she didn’t know what those words meant, but as realization began to slowly dawn on her, her large eyes widened. She looked over to Huo Violentstone in disbelief. Could it be…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe so-called young golden couple, perfectly suited for each other… that was… that seemed… to be her and Lin Ming!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWithin the entire Ancient Phoenix Clan, there were actually several women that had the perfect Ancient Phoenix bloodline. But, besides herself, everyone else was a senior disciple or already married – they clearly didn’t suit Lin Ming. In addition, there was also that look that Huo Violentstone shot at her just now. She already had a firm grasp that she was the subject of this marriage talk!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Yan Littlemoon realized this point, she didn’t know what to feel. For a woman with a perfect Ancient Phoenix bloodline, if a man was to take her primordial yin, that would have a tremendous effect on her own bloodline strength. After all, essence energy was the same as bloodline and double cultivation also meant to fuse a portion of her bloodline with the man’s, so how could she not be affected?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eYan Littlemoon had made a vow to never marry until she became a Holy Lord, because she didn’t want the power of her bloodline to be diluted. But now, if she married Lin Ming, then she…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Yan Littlemoon imagined such a scene, she found this a bit difficult to accept, and yet not at the same time…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShe couldn’t help but sneak a glance at Lin Ming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming didn’t seem to have any intention or interest in a marriage with anyone, thus he never even thought of it. He only looked at Huo Violentstone and said with all seriousness, “This disciple truly wishes to go out and adventure, I ask that Honorable Master approves!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-1067\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-1069\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-1068","bookId":1508,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:41:19 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:41:19 AM"}
