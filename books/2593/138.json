Hold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as he clicks off, McDermott gets back on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Van Patten?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He... had to take a piss,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you want to go to Kaktus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I\u0027m gripped by an existential panic,\" I lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think that\u0027s a good enough reason,\" McDermott says. \"I do not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\" Van Patten says, clicking back on. \"Bateman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" I ask. \"McDermott\u0027s here too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope. No way, Jose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on?\" McDermott asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, guys, do we want margaritas?\" Van Patten asks. \"Or no margaritas?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could go for a margarita,\" McDermott says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bateman?\" Van Patten asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would like several bottles of beer, preferably un -Mexican,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh shit,\" McDermott says. \"Call waiting. Hold on.\" He clicks off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I am not mistaken it is now eight-thirty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later. We\u0027re still debating. We have canceled the reservation at Kaktus and maybe someone has remade it. Confused, I actually cancel a nonexistent table at Zeus Bar. Jeanette has left her apartment and cannot be reached at home and I have no idea which restaurant she\u0027s going to, nor do I remember which one I told Evelyn to meet us at. Van Patten, who has already had two large shots of Absolut, asks about Detective Kimball and what we talked about and all I really remember is something like how people fail between cracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you talk to him?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did he say happened to Owen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vanished. Just vanished. Poof,\" he says. I can hear him opening a refrigerator. \"No incident. Nothing. The authorities have nada.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I say. \"I\u0027m in heavy turmoil over it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, Owen was... I don\u0027t know,\" he says. I can hear a beer being opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else did you tell him, Van Patten?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh the usual,\" he sighs. \"That he wore yellow and maroon ties. That he had lunch at \u002721.\u0027 That in reality he was not an arbitrageur - which was what Thimble thought he was - but a merger-maker. Only the usual.\" I can almost hear him shrug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s see. That he didn\u0027t wear suspenders. A belt man. That he stopped doing cocaine, simpatico beer. You know, Bateman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was a moron,\" I say. \"And now he\u0027s in London.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ,\" he mutters, \"general competence is on the f**king decline.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcDermott clicks back on. \"Okay. Now where to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What time is it?\" Van Patter asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nine-thirty,\" both of us answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, what happened to 1969?\" I ask van Patter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s this about 1969?\" McDermott doesn\u0027t have a clue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t remember,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Closed. No reservations,\" Van Patter reminds me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we get back to 1500?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"1500 is now closed,\" McDermott shouts. \"The kitchen is closed. The restaurant is closed. It\u0027s over. We have to go to Kaktus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello? Hello? Are you guys there?\" he hollers, losing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bouncy as a beach ball,\" Van Patter says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you guys think this is funny,\" McDermott warns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah, what? What are you going to do?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guys, it\u0027s just that I am apprehensive about failure in terms of securing a table before, like, well, midnight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure about 1500?\" I ask. \"That seems really bizarre.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That suggestion is moot!\" McDermott screams. \"Why, you may ask? Because-they-are-closed! Because-they-are-closed-they-have-stopped-taking-reservations! Are-you-following-this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, no sweat, babe,\" Van Patter says coolly. \"We\u0027ll go to Kaktus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have a reservation there in ten, no, fifteen minutes ago,\" McDermott says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I canceled them, I thought,\" I say, taking another Xanax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remade them,\u0027.
