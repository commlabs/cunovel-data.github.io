When I was a kid I read a short story about a preacher who went to Hell, and when he got there he discovered the dead didn\u0027t have eyelids, so they couldn\u0027t close their eyes to block out the horror. Right away I knew I wasn\u0027t in Hell, since I couldn\u0027t see a thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wriggled experimentally. I was in a small, closed space, which was an intriguing combination of soft and hard. I was lying on something hard, but the sides of my little cage were padded. If this was a hospital room, it was the strangest one ever. And where was everybody? I wriggled some more, then had a brainstorm and sat up. My head banged into something soft/hard, which gave way when I shoved. Then I was sitting up, blinking in the gloom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first I thought I was in a large, industrial kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I realized I was sitting in a coffin. Which had been placed on a large, stainless steel table. Which meant this wasn\u0027t a kitchen, this was-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nearly broke something scrambling out. As it was, I moved too quickly and the coffin and I tumbled off the table and onto the floor. I felt the shock in my knees as I hit and didn\u0027t care; in a flash I was on my feet and running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI burst through the doors and found myself in a large, wood-paneled entryway. It was even gloomier in here; there were no windows that I could see, just rows and rows of coat racks. At the far end of the entry was a tall, wild-eyed blonde dressed in an absurd pink suit. She might have been pretty if she wasn\u0027t wearing orange blusher and too much blue eye shadow. Her brownish-rose lipstick was all wrong for her face, too. She was so shockingly pale, just about any makeup would have been wrong for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wobbled toward me on cheap shoes-Payless, buy one pair get the second at half price-and I saw her hair was actually quite nice: shoulder-length, with a cute flip at the ends and interesting streaky highlights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInteresting Shade #23 Lush Golden Blonde highlights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman in the awful suit was me. The woman in the cheap shoes was me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI staggered closer to the mirror, wide-eyed. Yes, it was really me, and yes, I looked this awful. Well, why wouldn\u0027t I? I was dead, wasn\u0027t I? That silly ass in the Pontiac Aztek had killed me, hadn\u0027t he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was dead but too dumb to lie down. Dead and walking around inside the funeral home in a cheap suit and fake leather shoes. The funeral must be tomorrow...later today, I amended, looking at the clock. And my jerkweed of a stepmother must have picked out this outfit for me. And...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slipped one of the shoes off, looked at the inside. Property of Antonia O\u0027Neil Taylor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bitch meant to bury me wearing her cast-off shoes! This seemed more of an injustice than being driven into a tree while my cat watched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy cat! Who was going to look after the little monster? Jessica, probably, or maybe my mother...yes, probably my mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt occurred to me that I should seek out my grieving friends and family and tell them I had no intentions of being buried. Then sanity returned. I was dead. I\u0027d been zombified or whatever, and needed to finish the job the guy in the Aztek had started. Or maybe this was purgatory, a task set for me, something I had to finish before God opened the gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had the fleeting thought that the doctors in the ER had made a mistake, but shook it off. I remembered, too well, the sound of my skull shattering. If it hadn\u0027t killed me, I\u0027d be in an ICU now with more tubes than a chemistry classroom. Not dolled up like a...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e...whore wearing cheap castoffs on my...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e...feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll that aside, I couldn\u0027t bear to see anyone looking the way I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked to the end of the hallway, found the stairwell, and started climbing. The funeral home was three stories high-and what they needed the other two stories for I was not going to think about-which should be high enough, since I planned to go headfirst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first I thought the door was locked, but with a good hard shove it obligingly opened with a shriek of metal on metal. I stepped outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a beautiful spring night-all traces of snow from the storm had melted. The air smelled wet and warm, like fertility. I had the oddest feeling that if I were to scatter seeds on the cement rooftop, they would take hold and grow. A night had never, ever smelled so sweetly, not even the day I moved into my own place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I stepped onto the ledge, I ignored the not-inconsiderable twinge of apprehension that raced up my spine. This wasn\u0027t my last night on earth. That had been a couple of days ago. There was nothing to feel sad about. I had been a good girl in life, and now I was going to my reward, dammit. I was not going to stumble around like a zombie, scaring the hell out of people and pretending I still had a place in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God,\" I said, teetering for balance, \"I\u0027m coming to see you now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dove off the roof and hit the street below, headfirst, exactly as I had planned. What was not in the plan was the smashing, crunching pain in my head when I hit, how I didn\u0027t even lose consciousness, much less see my pal God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead I groaned, clutched my head, then finally stood when the pain abated. Only to get creamed by an early morning garbage truck. I looked up in time to see the horror-struck driver mouthing...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Jesus Christ, lady, look out!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e...something, then my forehead made brisk contact with the truck\u0027s front grille. I slid down it like road kill and hit the street, ass first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I stood, brushing dirt from my cheap skirt, the driver slammed the truck in reverse and got the hell out of Dodge. Not that I could blame him. But who ever heard of a hit and run garbage truck? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/undead-and-unwed-undead-1/page-2.html","bookId":2807,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:50 PM"}
