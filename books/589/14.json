Lion shot (with a bow) and missed, but Jackal hit and sang out, \"Hah! hah!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lion said, \"No, you did not shoot anything. It was I who hit.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jackal answered, \"Yea, my father, thou hast hit.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then they went home in order to return when the eland was dead, and cut it up. Jackal, however, turned back, unknown to Lion, hit his nose so that the blood ran on the spoor of the eland, and followed their track thus, in order to cheat Lion. When he had gone some distance, he returned by another way to the dead eland, and creeping into its carcass, cut out all the fat.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Meanwhile Lion followed the blood-stained[54] spoor of Jackal, thinking that it was eland blood, and only when he had gone some distance did he find out that he had been deceived. He then returned on Jackal\u0027s spoor, and reached the dead eland, where, finding Jackal in its carcass, he seized him by his tail and drew him out with a swing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lion upbraided Jackal with these words: \"Why do you cheat me?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jackal answered: \"No, my father, I do not cheat you; you may know it, I think.
