The memory of his undecided destiny had remained buried somewhere deep under all the rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could still become absolutely anyone. His future potential was indeterminate. An open book. A Book of Destiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was the one who would stand in front of Svetlana when she picked up the piece of chalk. And he would do it gladly, once Gesar had explained what it was all about. A serious, logical explanation. The boss of the Night Watch, the leader of the Light Ones of Moscow, a great and ancient magician – he\u0027d be able to explain everything clearly. Gesar would talk about correcting mistakes. And it would be the truth. Gesar would talk about the great future that would open up for Egor. And even that would be true! The Dark Ones could lodge a thousand protests, but the Inquisition would certainly take into account that the boy had initially suffered from their actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSvetlana would certainly be told that I was depressed by my failure with Egor. And that the main reason the boy had suffered was because the Watch had been busy saving her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wouldn\u0027t even hesitate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d accept everything she was told to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d pick up the piece of ordinary chalk that could be used to draw squares for hopscotch in the street or to write \u00272 + 2 \u003d 4\u0027 on a school blackboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she\u0027d start shaping a destiny that hadn\u0027t been defined yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat were they planning to make him into?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chief, a leader of new parties and revolutions?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA prophet of religions that hadn\u0027t been created yet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thinker who would found a new school of social thought? A musician, a poet, a writer, whose work would change the consciousness of millions?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust how many years into the future did the plan of the powers of the Light extend?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe original essential nature of an Other could not be changed. Egor would always be a very weak magician, but thanks to the intervention of the Night Watch, he would be a Light Magician.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd in order to alter the destiny of the human world, you didn\u0027t have to be an Other. It could even get in the way. It would be much better to have the support of the Watch while you led the human crowd, so much in need of the happiness we had invented for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he would lead them. I didn\u0027t know how, and I didn\u0027t know where, but he would lead them. But that was when the Dark Ones would make their move. An assassin can be found for every president. And for every prophet there are a thousand interpreters to distort the essence of the religion, to replace the bright flame with the heat of the inquisitors\u0027 pyres. The time came when every book was cast into the fire, when every symphony was reduced to a popular tune and played in all the bars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, we hadn\u0027t learned a thing. Probably because we didn\u0027t want to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut at least I still had a bit of time. And the right to make my move. My only move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only I knew what it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould I appeal to Svetlana not to accept what Gesar said, not to get involved in higher magic, not to change anyone else\u0027s destiny?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut why should she agree? Everything was being done correctly. Mistakes that had been made were being put right, a positive future was being created both for a single individual and for humanity as a whole. I was being relieved of the burden of the mistake I\u0027d made. Svetlana was being relieved of the knowledge that her good fortune had been paid for by someone else\u0027s tragedy. She was entering the ranks of the Great Sorceresses. What did my vague doubts mean compared to all that? And what were they really? How much was genuine concern, and how much petty self-interest? Where was the Light, where was the Dark?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Hey, friend!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe street trader who owned the stall I was standing in front of was staring at me. Not really angry, just rather annoyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You buying anything?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Do I look like an idiot?\u0027 I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Sure you do. If you\u0027re not buying, move on.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom where he stood he was right. But I was in the mood to talk back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You don\u0027t realise how lucky you are. I\u0027m collecting a crowd for you, attracting customers.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a colourful character. Stocky, red-faced, with huge thick arms, rippling masses of fat and muscle. He sized me up, obviously didn\u0027t see anything threatening and got ready to make some caustic remark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen suddenly he smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Okay, if you\u0027re collecting a crowd, put a bit more effort into it. Pretend to buy something. You can even pretend to pay me some money.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a pleasant surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled back at him:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Would you like me to buy something for real?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What would you do that for? This is rubbish for the tourists.\u0027 The trader stopped smiling, but there was no tension or aggression left in his face. \u0027This damn heat, it\u0027s driving me crazy. I wish it would rain.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up at the sky and shrugged. Something seemed to be changing. Something had shifted in the transparent blue dome of the heavenly oven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I think it\u0027s going to,\u0027 I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Great.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe nodded at each other and I walked away, slipping into the stream of people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know what to do, but I already knew where to go. And that was a start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 7\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTO A LARGE extent our powers are borrowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dark Ones draw theirs from the suffering of humans. Things are a lot simpler for them. They don\u0027t even have to cause people any pain. They can just wait. Just keep their eyes open and keep absorbing people\u0027s suffering, like drinking a cocktail through a straw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can do the same, only with one small difference. We draw strength from people who are feeling good, when they\u0027re happy. But there\u0027s one little difficulty that makes the process easy for the Dark Ones and almost forbidden to us. Happiness and sorrow are not just two levels on a single scale of human emotions. If they were, there\u0027d be no such thing as radiant sorrow or malicious joy. They\u0027re two parallel processes, two equal currents of power that Others can feel and use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a Dark Magician drinks in someone\u0027s pain, it only increases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a Light Magician takes someone\u0027s joy, it decreases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can absorb power at any moment. But we very rarely allow ourselves to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat day I decided that I was entitled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a little bit from a couple locked in each other\u0027s arms at the entrance to the metro. They were happy, very happy just then. But I could tell that the lovers were parting, and for a long time, and sadness would inevitably come to them anyway. I decided I had the right. Their joy was bright and rich, like a bouquet of scarlet roses, proud and delicate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI touched a child as he ran past – he was happy, he didn\u0027t feel the oppressive heat, he was running to buy an ice cream. He would soon restore his power. It was as simple and pure as wild flowers. A posy of daisies that I gathered without hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw an old woman in a window. The shadow of death was already hovering over her, she could probably sense it herself. But she was still smiling. Her grandson had called round to see her that day. Probably only to check if his grandmother was still alive, or if the valuable apartment in the centre of Moscow was free now. She understood that too, but she was still happy. I felt ashamed, unbearably ashamed, but I touched her and took a little power. A fading orange and yellow bunch of asters and autumn leaves . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked along just as I used to in my nightmares, when I handed out happiness to everyone on all sides, making sure no one went away without his share. But the trail I left behind me now was quite different. Slightly faded smiles, wrinkled foreheads, lips pressed together in doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was pretty easy to see where I\u0027d been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I met a Day Watch patrol, they wouldn\u0027t stop me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd even if any Light Ones saw what was happening, they wouldn\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was doing what I thought was necessary. What I believed I had a right to do. Borrowing. Stealing. And the way I used the power I\u0027d taken would seal my destiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEither I\u0027d pay back all my debts in full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr the Twilight would open its arms to embrace me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a Light Magician starts drawing power from humans, he\u0027s gambling everything on a single throw of the dice. And the usual balancing of accounts between the actions of the two Watches didn\u0027t apply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot only did the amount of Good that was done have to exceed the amount of Evil I had caused, I would have to be certain beyond a shadow of a doubt that I\u0027d paid everything back in full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lovers, the children, the old people. The group drinking beer by the statue. I\u0027d been afraid their happiness might turn out to be a sham, but it was genuine, and I took their power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForgive me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could apologise to every one of them three times over. I could pay for what I\u0027d taken. But I wouldn\u0027t really mean it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was simply fighting for love. In the first place. And only after that for you, the humans for whom this new happiness was being prepared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what if I were really doing that as well?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if, every time you fought for love, you were fighting for the whole world?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the whole world – not against the whole world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gathered it in crumbs, sometimes gently, sometimes in crude haste, to prevent my hand from trembling and my eyes from looking away in shame, as I took almost all there was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe happiness was a rare experience anyway for this young man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe without this smile, this woman would lose someone\u0027s love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe tomorrow this strong man with the ironic smile would die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe amulets in my pockets wouldn\u0027t be any use. There wasn\u0027t going be a fight. The \u0027top form\u0027 the boss had mentioned wouldn\u0027t help me either. That wouldn\u0027t be enough. And the right to carry out a second-degree intervention that Zabulon had granted me so generously was a trap. There wasn\u0027t any doubt about that. He\u0027d framed his own girlfriend, drawn the lines of probability together so that we\u0027d meet and then handed me his deadly gift with a mournful expression on his face. I couldn\u0027t see far enough into the future to be sure the Good I did would never become Evil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if you have no weapon, accept one even from the hands of your enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I\u0027d still been connected to Gesar by the narrow thread that maintains contact between a young magician and his mentor, he would long ago have sensed what was happening. Sensed the energy building up inside me, the massive energy I\u0027d gathered for some unknown purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat would he have done? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-watch-watch-1/page-68.html","bookId":2623,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:02:22 PM"}
