Everything felt pretty damn good that day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slugged him in the shoulder. “Jesus, Oren,” I started, but my scolding didn’t last any longer than that. I hugged him and kissed his cheek. “I’m sorry you didn’t get it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not.” Turning to me, he kissed me full on the mouth and he showed me how sorry he wasn’t that he was going to stay around a while longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to silently admit, I wasn’t sorry to see my husband stay, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe week progressed. I kept seeing Caroline every night I could, except we didn’t bother to hide anything. I pulled into her driveway to pick her up now, and we actually went out to see a movie at the theater and then a restaurant the next night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t see or talk to Gamble, and Caroline barely mentioned him. I asked her every day if everything was okay, but she merely smiled and said, “It’s fine. Don’t worry. He’ll come to his senses and get over it. He always does.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn’t so sure, but I let the issue drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I wasn’t the only one worried. Pick yanked me into his office the next time I worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know how much it sucks to be your boss and friend at the same time, right? Am I going to be forced to pick sides between you and Gamble?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. “No, Gamble was right. I shouldn’t have kept it from him. He has every right to be pissed at me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted his eyebrows. “I notice you’re saying you shouldn’t have kept it from him, not that you shouldn’t have touched his little sister.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Staying away from her wasn’t an option.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe I shouldn’t have ever touched her but it was too late for that, and I didn’t regret a minute of what had happened between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fuck,” Pick muttered, running his hand through his hair in frustration. “So I’m guessing he’s still more than pissed at you, and there’s going to be a lot of tension when you two work together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded. “Yeah, pretty much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lovely.” He growled out another frustrated breath. “Okay, fine. I’ll try to rework schedules to keep that from happening as much as possible. But there will always be Thursday nights.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” I started to shrug it off again when a new thought struck me. “Wait! You’re like every woman’s personal defender. Why aren’t you threatening me to stay away from Caroline the same way he his?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I’ve noticed how much you’ve changed lately. You’re faithful to her. And she’s happier than I’ve ever seen her before. I think you’re both good for each other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted. “Mind mentioning that to Gamble? He’s obviously not spotted any of the shit you have.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePick smiled and patted my arm. “Just give him time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, I hated time. It moved on, though, and Thursday came before I was ready for it. Ladies’ Night at the Forbidden Nightclub started, and Gamble worked the bar with Lowe, as he usually did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the most part, we avoided each other. I took my orders to Lowe, and it worked out just fine…for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt one point, I saw Gamble talking to some scantily clad chick. He motioned toward me and she looked my way, but I didn’t think much of it, not until Gamble told me to go into the back and fetch another crate of Heineken. I still didn’t catch on, not until I was in the stockroom, cornered in the last row of shelves next to the wall with my arms lifted to drag down the necessary crate, when a pair of feminine hands wrapped around my waist from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that’s when I finally got it. He’d sent some skank back to set me up in some kind of compromising position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Ten of a year ago would’ve been all over that. Hell, the Ten of three months ago might’ve even fallen prey to her. But the Ten who’d discovered the woman of his dreams had secretly slipped into his room to be with him wanted nothing to do with this cheap imitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerking away, I threw up my hands, dislodging her hold on me. “What the fuck?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should’ve known Noel was up to something awful the moment I approached the bar at Forbidden to make sure he and Oren hadn’t killed each other yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sent me an evil little smirk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Looking for your boyfriend? He went back to the stockroom.” When he tipped his chin toward the back hall, encouraging me to go, I knew I’d find something I didn’t want to, something about Oren that should change my mind about him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5/page-153.html","bookId":2714,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:13 AM"}
