Tears and sweat dripped down his face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The receptionist came into the room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes?\" said Dr. Payne.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jason was glad for the break.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Kendall\u0027s mother is on the phone,\" said the receptionist. \"She refuses to pay her bill.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What?!\" exclaimed Dr. Payne. \"How dare-\"\n\u003cbr\u003e 116\n\u003cbr\u003e \"She says you pulled the wrong tooth.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Give me the phone!\" shouted Dr. Payne.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The receptionist handed it to her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"This is Dr. Payne. What do you mean you\u0027re not paying your bill? . . . Well, then, just bring Kendall back in here, and I\u0027ll pull that one too. I\u0027ll pull them all! But you still have to pay me. Your lawyer! I don\u0027t care what your lawyer said. You can tell your lawyer to rub a monkey\u0027s tummy!... You heard me! Rub a monkey\u0027s tummy with your head!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She slammed down the phone. Jason looked at the diploma hanging on the wall. Before his dentist got married, her name was Jane Smith.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His big mouth opened wider.\n\u003cbr\u003e 117\n\u003cbr\u003e \"I found Jane Smith,\" Jason told Stephen the next morning when he got to school.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You better tell Deedee,\" said Stephen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They hurried across the playground.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A whistle blew. \"No running!\" ordered Mr. Louis, the Professional Playground Supervisor. \"Now I want both of you to go back to the edge of the blacktop, and walk this time.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The boys went back the way they came, then came back the way they went\n\u003cbr\u003e 118\n\u003cbr\u003e Deedee was sitting on a bench. She had been benched by Mr. Louis for excessive noisemaking.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I found Jane Smith,\" Jason whispered as he\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e walked past her. . . .\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e . . . Deedee and Jason entered the classroom together. Mrs. Drazil was seated behind her desk. As they passed in front of her, Deedee stopped and said, \"Did you have a nice time at the dentist yesterday, Jason?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, Deedee,\" said Jason. \"It was very\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e nice.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wonder if we have the same dentist,\" said Deedee. \"What is your dentist\u0027s name?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Her name is Dr. Payne,\" said Jason. \"But that hasn\u0027t always been her name.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It hasn\u0027t?\" asked Deedee.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, no,\" said Jason. \"Before she was married, her name was Jane Smith.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Jane Smith?\" asked Deedee. \"Is that spelled J-A-N-E S-M-I-T-H?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, that\u0027s how you spell Jane Smith,\" said Jason. \"But like I said, that\u0027s not her name anymore. Her name is Dr. Payne. She works at the dentist office at 124 Garden Street.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They took their seats. . . .\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e . . . Late that afternoon Dr. Payne finished work and walked out of her office. It had been a good day. She had drilled twenty-five teeth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She made sixty dollars for every tooth she drilled. Twenty-five times sixty dollars is $1,500. Not bad for a day\u0027s work.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Of course, not all the teeth really had cavities, but how would any of her patients find out?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She got into her fancy silver-and-black sports car and drove away. She sang along with the radio.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She didn\u0027t even notice the old beat-up green station wagon in her rearview mirror.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She lived in a mansion next to the lake. There was a stone wall around the house. She pressed a button in her car, and an iron gate opened. The gate closed behind her as she headed up the long and winding driveway.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A moment later the old green station wagon stopped and parked next to the gate. A woman got out, walked around to the back, and opened the tailgate. She pulled out a ladder. She set the ladder up against the wall.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Under her arm she carried an old blue notebook. . . .\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e . . . Dr. Payne\u0027s butler handed her a drink. The cook was making dinner.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dr. Payne\u0027s dog, cat, and husband were waiting\n\u003cbr\u003e 120\n\u003cbr\u003e for her in the den. Her dog\u0027s name was Brussels, and her cat\u0027s name was Sprouts. She petted them both.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her husband\u0027s name was Sham. She petted him too.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hi, darling, how was your day?\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I made fifteen hundred dollars,\" said Jane.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They hugged and kissed. They loved each other, but they loved money even more.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then they had dinner by candlelight as they watched the sun set over the lake. After dinner they sat out on the deck, under the stars.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sprouts lay purring on Jane\u0027s lap. Brussels sat faithfully by her side.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Life was perfect.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I love you, darling,\" she said, petting Sprouts.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And I love you,\" said Sham.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I was talking to the cat,\" said Jane.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The butler stepped out onto the deck. \"Excuse me, madam,\" he said, \"but there\u0027s an elderly woman out in the yard.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jane\u0027s long fingernails dug into her cat\u0027s neck.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wonder how she got past the gate,\" said Sham.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know, sir,\" said the butler. \"She\u0027s probably hungry. Perhaps I can give her some leftover-\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No!\" shouted Jane. \"Get rid of her!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Let me have a look,\" said Sham. He followed the butler back into the house.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He returned a moment later. \"Darling, you\u0027ll never guess who\u0027s here. One of your former teachers! Isn\u0027t that just the sweetest-\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jane screamed. She jumped to her feet. Sprouts flew off her lap and into the hot tub.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What\u0027s wrong?\" asked Sham.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You idiot!\" shouted Jane. \"I told you to get rid of her!\" She kicked her dog out of the way, then climbed over the railing and jumped off the deck to the ground, fifteen feet below.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Drazil came out onto the deck. \"You can\u0027t get away from me, young lady!\" she hollered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jane hurt her ankle pretty badly when she hit the ground. It was either sprained or broken. She lay on the ground in agony as she looked up at her former teacher.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You have homework to do,\" said Mrs. Drazil, looking down at her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jane\u0027s face twisted with pain. \"Rub a monkey\u0027s tummy!\" she shouted, then struggled to her feet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She had a suitcase stashed in the boathouse, just in case this ever happened. She hobbled to it, grabbed it, then limped down to the lake, dragging her suitcase behind her.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1990/56938.html","bookId":676,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 2:24:18 PM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 1:28:52 PM"}
