I said you’d stay with the little guy.” He tilts his head toward the door behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want him to be alone,” I add, my voice raw again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course.” Stuart nods. “There’s nowhere else I’d want to be right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving Stuart, Josh takes the lead and I follow him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStopping, I turn back. “Stuart?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stops with the door partway open. “Yeah?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step forward. “Hold his hand. He likes to wrap his hand around your finger.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe offers a light smile. “Okay, I’ll make sure to do that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And Stuart.” I catch his attention again. “You have to clean your hands with that sanitizer stuff before you touch him, you know, to keep the germs away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sanitizer. Got it.” He nods. “I’ll take good care of him, Jake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know you will.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI follow Josh down the hall toward the bank of elevators. My heart labours heavy in my chest. Fear roils around me at the thought of seeing Tru.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I’ve wanted for the last few hours is to see her, and now I’m so close. I’m so very fucking terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe step inside the elevator. Josh presses the button to take us down a few floors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doors slide closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jake, I want you to be prepared for seeing Tru. She’s not going to be—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t say it. I know. But…just don’t say it.” I cross my arms, pushing at the ache in my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh nods and stares straight ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator glides to a halt, the doors slide open, and I follow Josh out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith every step closer to Tru, the more panic and terror I feel at what I’m going to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe take a right at the end of the hall, into another empty hall, except for a man sitting, writing on some papers attached to a clipboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePutting the clipboard down, he stands at our approach and pushes his glasses up his nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s a bookish-looking doctor wearing blue cotton pants and a V-neck top. At least he’s not wearing a white coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s wearing scrubs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre they what he wore while operating on Tru?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start to feel sick as unwanted images flash through my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Josh.” He nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lucas, this is Jake Wethers, Trudy’s fiancé. Jake, this is Dr. Lucas Kish.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nice to meet you, Jake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod a response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s not exactly like I want to shake his fucking hand and say It’s nice to meet you, because it’s really fucking not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t want to meet him. I don’t want Tru to be here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, so…” He pushes his hands into his trouser pockets. “As Dr. Kimble explained to you before, Trudy suffered a severe head injury as a result of the impact.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wince at the pain the words bring me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“From the impact, she hit her right frontal lobe, what we call the emotional part of the brain, causing a severe contusion to the skull. There was internal bleeding and swelling to the brain. We stemmed the bleeding and eased the pressure there. Trudy also suffered other injuries from the accident. Her collarbone was fractured, her right arm broken, and her hand crushed…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFractured. Broken. Crushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“…but it’s the head injury that obviously causes the most concern.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to steer my emotions deep inside so I can focus on what he’s telling me. But my eyes keep flicking to the door to my left, where I know Tru is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking a deep breath, I force out the words I fear the answer to most. “Is she going to get through this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Kish removes his hands from his pockets, folds them together, and takes a deep breath. I see his eyes sweep the floor before coming back to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNerves crawl around my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The next twenty-four hours are critical. Her vitals are stable but low. She’s in a coma and attached to a ventilator. She isn’t breathing on her own. With your consent, I plan on removing the ventilator in the next twenty-four to forty-eight hours to see if Trudy responds to breathing alone. If she does, we’re looking on the side of positive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow hard. “And…if she doesn’t?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks me firmly in the eye. “We cross that bridge when we come to it. These next few days are critical for Trudy’s recovery, but I promise you that we are going to do everything in our power to see her through to the other side of this and get her back home with you and your son.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI push at the ache in my chest with my hand. “When she does wake, could there be long-term damage to her brain?” My mouth feels papery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe removes his glasses and rubs his eyes. “Possibly, yes. We won’t know that until she wakes. The good thing is, the left side of her brain is fine. If it had been the left, her speech, amongst other things, could have been affected. So we have that to be thankful for.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tense, fist clenching at my side. “I don’t see anything to be thankful for right now.” My tone is cold, biting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see the concern flash over his face. “Of course not, I didn’t mean…I’m sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jake.” Josh’s hand goes to my arm, but I can’t relax. “Lucas didn’t mean anything by it. He’s just trying to give you the positive side of the bad. He is one of the best neurosurgeons the US has to offer. You can trust him. He will do everything possible to get Tru through this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes go to Josh, then Dr. Kish. I swallow past the brick in my throat. “You have to get her through this because…she’s everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at me with understanding, and he nods his head once. “You have my word, Jake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, I just…” I rub my hand over my face. “Can I…? I just want to see her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Kish steps closer. “You can, but I need you to be prepared. Trudy will look very different right now. There’s severe bruising to her face, and her eyes are slightly open, giving the impression that she’s awake. It’s due to the swelling on the brain, which forces the eyes open—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” I cut him off, not needing to hear any more. “I just need to see her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving them both where they stand, I head straight to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning, I realise I haven’t asked before now. “How did the accident happen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh glances at Kish, then back to me. “A drunk driver. He ran a red light and went into the side of them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRage I never knew I possessed strikes me, driving into my head like nails. I grit my teeth together, fists clenched at my sides. “Did he survive? The driver?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJosh shakes his head slowly. “No. He died on impact.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good.” Because I would have killed the motherfucker with my bare hands if he had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning back to the door, back to Tru, I pull in a deep breath, then push down on the handle and walk slowly into the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTru.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus, no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePain digs its ruthless claws deep into my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing could have ever prepared me for this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks broken. Barely resembling the Tru I know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything suddenly seems slow, like I’m moving against water as I take her in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer skin is pale. There’s a white soft bandage over the right side of her head, and I can see that her beautiful hair has been shaved off in front.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer right arm up to her shoulder is in a cast. Her hand is swaddled in bandages. Her face is swollen and bruised. Her eyes are slightly open, like Kish said they would be. She looks awake, but I know she’s not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore than anything, I wish she were. I would give everything to have her awake right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy skin prickles and my senses go into overload as I take in all the tubes emerging from her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe machines keeping her alive beep, echoing inside my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJesus, no, baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMemories of her flash through my mind…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing her again in that hotel room after all those years…Tru lying beneath me as I moved inside her the first time we made love…confessing my love for her…dancing with her at the Eiffel Tower…her agreeing to marry me…us together on that island…her face when she saw our new home…Tru telling me she was pregnant…the first moment we saw our baby on the monitor…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrossing the room in strides, I fall to my knees at her bedside, hitting the cold, hard tile floor. The bite of pain is barely noticeable to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take hold of her hand, pressing my face against it. I inhale her scent, needing to be close to her. Needing her. But it only makes this hurt so much more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears track painful lines down my cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t leave me, Tru.” I choke on the pain in my throat as tears drip from my chin onto the bed. “I need you so fuckin’ much. We need you. We’ve got a son, Tru, and he’s so perfect, so beautiful. He looks just like you. I love you so fuckin’ much. Don’t leave me, baby, please…” I close my eyes. “Please come back to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pace the foyer of the small wing where Tru and my son now are. Security flanks the door behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I knew would happen, the press are camped outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey won’t even give me space to figure my way through this. It’s all over the news—the accident, Tru’s condition, and how my son was brought into this world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few hours ago, a reporter managed to sneak his way into the hospital. His aim was to get a picture of Tru in her hospital bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat kind of sick fuck does that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he had gotten anywhere near her, I would have killed him where he stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt turns out the guy never even made it down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDave set up residency outside Tru’s room the second he was released. With his broken arm, he dragged the reporter out of there. Or so I’ve been told. I didn’t see it myself. I was with my son at the time. I hate that I wasn’t there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Tru and my son’s safety, I had them moved to a private wing. Their rooms are next to one another’s, with Dave situated outside Tru’s door and a guard outside my son’s. Security is covering both entrances and exits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven’t spoken to Dave about the accident or the incident with the reporter. I haven’t spoken to him at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a brief conversation with Denny earlier, he told me Dave is blaming himself for the accident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t his fault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave I told him that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m not entirely sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd why am I here pacing the floor outside the elevators and not with Tru right now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause Billy and Eva are on their way up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I am so very fucking terrified to see them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven’t spoken to them yet.
