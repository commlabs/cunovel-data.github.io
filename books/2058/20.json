Not even Nurse Ratched could have startled me that much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMei was flipping through a magazine and glanced up, appearing bored. \"Oh. You\u0027re awake. Finally.\" She stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What...what happened?\" I asked, blinking at the light pouring in through my window. I was kind of surprised she hadn\u0027t shut the curtains. She didn\u0027t really strike me as a fun-in-the-sun person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t remember?\" Her disinterested expression sharpened. \"Jerome said it would all come back to you. If it hasn\u0027t...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat up, drawing my knees to my body. \"No, no. I remember...I remember what happened at Erik\u0027s. I remember...the Oneroi.\" Saying the word made me shudder. \"But what happened after that? How long have I been asleep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three days,\" she said flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I stared at her, my mouth agape. If Mei was the joking type, I would have expected the punch line now. \"I don\u0027t...I mean, it went so fast. And I didn\u0027t dream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crooked me a smile. \"Seems like you\u0027d want that. And heavy sleep heals you faster.\" The smile changed to a grimace. \"Not that waiting by your bedside for three days has really felt that fast. Jerome made me keep all your friends away. That was fun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you just use sarcasm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m leaving,\" she said, back to her all business self. \"I\u0027ve done what Jerome asked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait! What happened to Seth and Erik? Are they okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" she said. I waited for her to vanish, but it didn\u0027t come. She peered at me curiously. \"It shouldn\u0027t have worked, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What shouldn\u0027t have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That ritual. There is no way that human could have found you. Not among all those other souls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Oneroi had said the same thing, and thinking back to the storm of color and disorder, I could understand their reasoning. \"We...we love each other.\" I wasn\u0027t sure I had the right to those words, but they came out anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMei rolled her eyes. \"That means nothing. Human love - no matter what all your songs and chick flicks tell you - isn\u0027t enough. It shouldn\u0027t have worked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know what to say. \"Well...I guess it did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jerome knew it would too,\" she mused, a small frown wrinkling her brow. Her gaze hardened on me. \"Did you? Do you know how it happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I squeaked. \"No! I don\u0027t understand any of this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI expected her to deny this and question me further. Instead her frown only deepened, and I realized I was no longer of use in solving this dilemma to her. She vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant she disappeared, Roman came bursting into my room. \"She\u0027s gone?\" he asked. If he was nearby, he would have felt her signature go away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you been hanging out the whole time?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat down in the chair she\u0027d been in. \"Jerome ordered her not to let anyone come near you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could have taken her,\" I said, attempting a joke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not without causing a whole lot of trouble.\" He frowned, eyes troubled with thought. \"Although, I would have revealed myself if I\u0027d needed to if that...thing that came out of the gate had tried to take on Carter and Jerome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered at the memory. \"I didn\u0027t even know there were monsters like that in the - wait. How could you have helped them? Were you...were you in the circle?\" I\u0027d assumed he\u0027d been watching from the sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\" He said no more, and the way he spoke implied that it had been a ridiculous question for me to ask in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you crazy?\" I exclaimed. \"You weren\u0027t just letting yourself get trapped. If you were discovered by Mei - even any of the dream creatures - you\u0027d be fucked. They would have turned you in too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was no choice,\" Roman said. \"I had to be there, in case you needed me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was too big a risk,\" I countered, my voice faltering this time. \"If there\u0027d been a fight, Jerome and Carter would have had no reason to defend you. And while that Morphean might have been afraid to hurt them, you would have been fair game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you, it doesn\u0027t matter. I had to be there for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes, those eyes that were so like the sea I\u0027d grown up with, held such earnestness and affection that I had to look away. I couldn\u0027t believe he\u0027d risked what he had for me. Why? He had no reason to care about me after what I\u0027d done to him, yet it was clear he still wanted me. The night I\u0027d been captured seemed like a lifetime ago, but its events came back to me in perfect detail: his lips, his hands...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish you wanted to kill me again,\" I muttered. \"It was easier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rested his hand on mine, its warmth spreading through me. \"Nothing about your life is ever easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked back up at him. \"That\u0027s for damn sure. But I don\u0027t know...I don\u0027t know if I can do this...by which I mean, well, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to do anything,\" he said. \"We\u0027ll just keep going on like we have. Roommates. We\u0027ll see where things go. If they change, they change. If not...\" He shrugged. \"So it goes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I mention that it was easier when you wanted to kill me? I\u0027m not sure how I feel about you being so reasonable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, maybe I just feel sorry for you right now after everything that happened. Maybe I\u0027ll change my mind in a little while.\" He squeezed my hand. \"Was it...was it awful?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked away again. \"Yes. Beyond awful. It\u0027s hard to explain. They showed me every nightmare I could have, every fear made flesh. Some of the things they showed me had already happened - and were almost as bad as the nightmares. I couldn\u0027t tell what was reality anymore. They showed me you guys...but it wasn\u0027t always real. I doubted everything: who I was, what I felt...\" I swallowed back tears, glad I had averted my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" he said softly, reaching out to tip my chin and make me look back at him. \"It\u0027s over. You\u0027re safe. We\u0027ll help you get better - I\u0027ll help. I won\u0027t let anything happen to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, his feelings for me made me uncomfortable and confused. Was it a lingering effect of the Oneroi? No, I decided a moment later. This was the kind of situation that would confuse anyone. My heart was still tangled up in Seth, someone I knew I should let go, but who had found me against impossible odds. And here was Roman, someone I could be with a bit more easily - well, kind of - and who had risked his life for me. Could I move on with him? I didn\u0027t know. But I could try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found his hand again and squeezed it. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned toward me, and I think we might have kissed, but the ringing of my cell phone jolted us out of any romantic spell. I pulled my hand from his and grabbed the phone from my side table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Kincaid,\" came the kind, familiar voice. \"It is a pleasure to speak with you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Erik! Oh, I\u0027m so happy it\u0027s you. I wanted to thank you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing to thank me for. I would gladly do it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then, I\u0027m still thanking you anyway.\" Roman, realizing this had nothing to do with him, got up and wandered off - but not before giving me one more fond look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you wish,\" said Erik. \"Are you feeling better?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More or less. Certainly better in body. And I think the rest will come.\" I wished that with my body\u0027s healing, I could also forget all the horrible things I\u0027d seen. That wouldn\u0027t happen, though, and I felt no need to trouble him with my problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m glad,\" he said. \"Very glad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence fell, and a suspicious feeling nudged its way into my brain. I\u0027d assumed he was simply calling to check up on me, but something now told me there was more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Kincaid,\" he said at last. \"I\u0027m sure you don\u0027t want to talk about what happened....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - well.\" I hesitated. I knew Erik. He wouldn\u0027t bring this up without a good reason. \"Is there something we should talk about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was his turn to hesitate. \"You thank me...but to be truthful, what we did shouldn\u0027t have worked. I didn\u0027t expect it to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMei\u0027s comments came back to me, as did the other conversations I\u0027d witnessed via the dreams. \"Nobody seemed to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Jerome did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is this going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know how it worked. Mr. Mortensen should not have found your soul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI loved Erik and hated the irritation in my voice. \"I keep hearing that over and over, but obviously he did. Maybe it should have been impossible, but after what I went through? I don\u0027t care how it happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would imagine not, but still...still, I can\u0027t help but wonder at this. Would you mind telling me what it was like when he found you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was one part of the ordeal I didn\u0027t mind recounting, largely because it had had a happy ending. Of course, the logistics of explaining it weren\u0027t so easy. I did my best to describe what it was like being adrift in the dream world and how Seth had seemed to call to me. Erik listened patiently and then asked if I\u0027d tell him about my contract with Hell and how I\u0027d sold my soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was a little harder to tell, not to mention a bizarre question. The Oneroi had shown me so many versions of what had happened with Kyriakos and me, and while some had been true and some false, they\u0027d all been horrible. Still, sensing something big might be going on here, I haltingly recounted the whole experience: how I\u0027d cheated on Kyriakos with his best friend, infidelity that was later discovered. It was the sorrow from that that had driven Kyriakos into suicidal grief, which in turn drove me to sign a contract with Hell. I\u0027d sold my soul and become a succubus, in exchange for everyone I knew - including Kyriakos - to forget me and the awful things I\u0027d done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me the terms one more time,\" said Erik.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was that everyone I knew back then would forget me and forget what happened - family, friends, and especially my husband.\" My voice choked a little. \"It worked. I came back later, and no one knew me. Not even a glimmer of familiarity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was nothing else in the contract?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. An imp I know looked it over recently and verified it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" This caught Erik\u0027s interest. \"Why would he do that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She. As a favor. The imp who\u0027d brokered my sale was the one who worked with Nyx and kept messing with Seth. Hugh said when an imp shows that much interest, there\u0027s something wrong with a contract. So Kristin - this other imp - looked at my contract.\" She hadn\u0027t been very happy about doing that. If she\u0027d been caught snooping in Hell\u0027s records, there would have been some very, very bad consequences. Her gratitude over me hooking her up with her boss had overpowered her fear. \"She told me it was airtight. Everything was like it was supposed to be. No errors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore silence. This conversation was starting to make me uneasy. \"Did this imp - Niphon? - end up doing anything to Mr. Mortensen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not so much...I mean, it was part of what led us to breaking up....\" I paused to collect myself. \"But there were a lot of other factors that caused that too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has Niphon been back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but there has been this succubus.\" With everything else, I\u0027d forgotten about Simone. \"She was impersonating me. Kept trying to seduce Seth...but it didn\u0027t work. I think Jerome sent her packing, but I\u0027m not sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain, Erik took a long time in responding. Finally, he sighed. \"Thank you, Miss Kincaid. You\u0027ve given me much to think about. I apologize if I\u0027ve brought up painful memories. And I\u0027m very happy you\u0027re feeling better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I said. \"And thanks again for your help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe disconnected, and I wandered out to the living room. Roman was in the kitchen, plating up some grilled cheese sandwiches. \"Hungry?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Starving,\" I said. He handed me a plate, along with a cup of coffee, and I smiled. \"Thanks. Not sure what I did to deserve this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to do anything. Besides, I had extra. Wanted a big meal before going to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before - what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe grin he gave me indicated he\u0027d been dying to deliver this news. \"I got a job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did. Went back to the school I used to teach at. They had a couple openings, so I\u0027m doing a few classes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was dumbfounded. After all my badgering, Roman had sought gainful employment - in his specialty, no less: linguistics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does this mean you\u0027re going to pay rent now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s not get carried away, love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed a plate of his own, and we ate in the living room while the cats watched hopefully for leftovers. Seeing Godiva, I felt a frown coming on. The dream. The man in the dream. The Oneroi had said it was Seth...but that was impossible. I lifted my eyes up to Roman, wondering if I could rekindle the love I\u0027d once had. If there was any man in any dream, he would be a better candidate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You talked to Erik for a while,\" Roman said, noting my scrutiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s weirded out by my rescue. He says it shouldn\u0027t have worked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I heard that too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetween bites, I recounted the conversation, including Erik\u0027s interest in Seth and my contract. \"I don\u0027t see what the big deal is,\" I concluded. \"Seth and I still have feelings for each other - feelings we\u0027re trying to get past.\" In that moment when our souls had met, though, separating from him had been the last thing I wanted. \"Maybe that was enough. Maybe people don\u0027t have faith in the power of love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" said Roman. But he looked thoughtful now too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA knock at the door interrupted further conversation. I felt no immortal signature and hoped it wasn\u0027t my neighbor trolling for more sex. He\u0027d mercifully left me alone so far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no, it wasn\u0027t Gavin. It was Maddie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she was crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked no questions. When friends are in trouble, you take care of them first. I pulled her right inside and led her to the couch, immediately putting my arms around her. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" I asked finally. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t speak right away. Her sobs were too great, and she was choking on her own tears. Something nudged my arm. It was Roman handing me a box of tissues. I shot him a grateful look and gave some to Maddie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt long last, she gasped out, \"It\u0027s Seth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart stopped. For a moment, a hundred awful scenarios flew through my mind. Seth hit by a car. Seth struck by some deadly disease. I clutched her arm, so tightly that I realized my nails were digging into her. I relaxed my grip as best I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" I demanded. \"Is he okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He ended it.\" Her crying renewed. \"He broke the engagement and told me it was over.\" She buried her face against my shoulder, and I stroked her absentmindedly as my brain tried hard to really comprehend her words. I must have misheard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He couldn\u0027t have,\" I said, my voice as cracked as hers. \"He...he loves you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted her head and looked at me with mournful, glittering eyes. \"He said he didn\u0027t love me the way he should - that he didn\u0027t love me the way I deserved. He said it\u0027d be wrong to make me marry him, that we weren\u0027t meant to spend our lives together.\" She took a tissue and wiped her nose, then her eyes grew wide with desperation. \"What does that mean, Georgina? Why would he say he\u0027s making me marry him? I want to. I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked over her and met Roman\u0027s eyes. We couldn\u0027t speak the way greater immortals could, but enough messages passed between us. Seth hadn\u0027t forced her to get engaged, no, but he\u0027d done it out of guilt, guilt for cheating on her and continually being drawn to me when he believed it was better for us to stay apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said he loved me,\" Maddie continued. \"But that I needed someone who loved me more - someone I was the world to. He said he\u0027d only hurt me worse if we went on. How could it hurt worse?\" The tears grew worse. She pulled away and buried her face in her hands. \"It can\u0027t hurt worse than this. I want to die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" I said, drawing her back to me. \"Don\u0027t say that. Don\u0027t ever say that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Georgina,\" warned Roman softly. I realized I was shaking Maddie and immediately stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to me,\" I said, turning her face toward mine. \"You are an amazing person. You are one of the best people I know. You\u0027ll get over this...I swear it. I won\u0027t let you go through it alone, okay? And you deserve the best. If it\u0027s not him, then you\u0027ll get someone better.\" The next words were hard for me. I should have rejoiced at this news. I wouldn\u0027t have to watch them together. I also had a feeling that I was somehow involved in this. What had she said? That Seth said she deserved to be someone\u0027s world? He\u0027d told me I was his. In one of the dreams, he\u0027d said that to her, but I now knew that was a lie. Still, I couldn\u0027t help it when I said, \"And maybe...maybe if you guys talk more, you\u0027ll understand...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sobs abated - just a little - as she gave me a puzzled look. \"That\u0027s the thing.
