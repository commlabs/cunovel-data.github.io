Centuries of experience in the emergency room were evident in his quiet, authoritative voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emmett, Rose, get Jasper outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnsmiling for once, Emmett nodded. \"Come on, Jasper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper struggled against Emmett\u0027s unbreakable grasp, twisting around, reaching toward his brother with his bared teeth, his eyes still past reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward\u0027s face was whiter than bone as he wheeled to crouch over me, taking a clearly defensive position. A low warning growl slid from between his clenched teeth. I could tell that he wasn\u0027t breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosalie, her divine face strangely smug, stepped in front of Jasper��keeping a careful distance from his teeth��and helped Emmett wrestle him through the glass door that Esme held open, one hand pressed over her mouth and nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsme\u0027s heart-shaped face was ashamed. \"I\u0027m so sorry, Bella,\" she cried as she followed the others into the yard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me by, Edward,\" Carlisle murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA second passed, and then Edward nodded slowly and relaxed his stance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle knelt beside me, leaning close to examine my arm. I could feel the shock frozen on my face, and I tried to compose it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here, Carlisle,\" Alice said, handing him a towel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Too much glass in the wound.\" He reached over and ripped a long, thin scrap from the bottom of the white tablecloth. He twisted it around my arm above the elbow to form a tourniquet. The smell of the blood was making me dizzy. My ears rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella,\" Carlisle said softly. \"Do you want me to drive you to the hospital, or would you like me to take care of it here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here, please,\" I whispered. If he took me to the hospital, there would be no way to keep this from Charlie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get your bag,\" Alice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s take her to the kitchen table,\" Carlisle said to Edward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward lifted me effortlessly, while Carlisle kept the pressure steady on my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you doing, Bella?\" Carlisle asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine.\" My voice was reasonably steady, which pleased me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward\u0027s face was like stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice was there. Carlisle\u0027s black bag was already on the table, a small but brilliant desk light plugged into the wall. Edward sat me gently into a chair, and Carlisle pulled up another. He went to work at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward stood over me, still protective, still not breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just go, Edward,\" I sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can handle it,\" he insisted. But his jaw was rigid; his eyes burned with the intensity of the thirst he fought, so much worse for him than it was for the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t need to be a hero,\" I said. \"Carlisle can fix me up without your help. Get some fresh air.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI winced as Carlisle did something to my arm that stung.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll stay,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you so masochistic?\" I mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle decided to intercede. \"Edward, you may as well go find Jasper before he gets too far. I\u0027m sure he\u0027s upset with himself, and I doubt he\u0027ll listen to anyone but you right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I eagerly agreed. \"Go find Jasper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might as well do something useful,\" Alice added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward\u0027s eyes narrowed as we ganged up on him, but, finally, he nodded once and sprinted smoothly through the kitchen\u0027s back door. I was sure he hadn\u0027t taken a breath since I\u0027d sliced my finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA numb, dead feeling was spreading through my arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough it erased the sting, it reminded me of the gash, and I watched Carlisle\u0027s face carefully to distract me from what his hands were doing. His hair gleamed gold in the bright light as he bent over my arm. I could feel the faint stirrings of unease in the pit of my stomach, but I was determined not to let my usual squeamishness get the best of me. There was no pain now, just a gentle tugging sensation that I tried to ignore. No reason to get sick like a baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she hadn\u0027t been in my line of sight, I wouldn\u0027t have noticed Alice give up and steal out of the room. With a tiny, apologetic smile on her lips, she disappeared through the kitchen doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s everyone,\" I sighed. \"I can clear a room, at least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not your fault,\" Carlisle comforted me with a chuckle. \"It could happen to anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could\" I repeated. \"But it usually just happens to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis relaxed calm was only more amazing set in direct contrast with everyone else\u0027s reaction. I couldn\u0027t find any trace of anxiety in his face. He worked with quick, sure movements. The only sound besides our quiet breathing was the soft plink, plink as the tiny fragments of glass dropped one by one to the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you do this?\" I demanded. \"Even Alice and Esme��\" I trailed off, shaking my head in wonder. Though the rest of them had given up the traditional diet of vampires just as absolutely as Carlisle had, he was the only one who could bear the smell of my blood without suffering from the intense temptation. Clearly, this was much more difficult than he made it seem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Years and years of practice,\" he told me. \"I barely notice the scent anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think it would be harder if you took a vacation from the hospital for a long time. And weren\u0027t around any blood?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\" He shrugged his shoulders, but his hands remained steady. \"I\u0027ve never felt the need for an extended holiday.\" He flashed a brilliant smile in my direction. \"I enjoy my work too much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlink, plink, plink. I was surprised at how much glass there seemed to be in my arm. I was tempted to glance at the growing pile, just to check the size, but I knew that idea would not be helpful to my no-vomiting strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it that you enjoy?\" I wondered. It didn\u0027t make sense to me��the years of struggle and self-denial he must have spent to get to the point where he could endure this so easily. Besides, I wanted to keep him talking; the conversation kept my mind off the queasy feeling in my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis dark eyes were calm and thoughtful as he answered. \"Hmm. What I enjoy the very most is when my�� enhanced abilities let me save someone who would otherwise have been lost. It\u0027s pleasant knowing that, thanks to what I can do, some people\u0027s lives are better because I exist. Even the sense of smell is a useful diagnostic tool at times.\" One side of his mouth pulled up in half a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mulled that over while he poked around, making sure all the glass splinters were gone. Then he rummaged in his bag for new tools, and I tried not to picture a needle and thread.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You try very hard to make up for something that was never your fault,\" I suggested while a new kind of tugging started at the edges of my skin. \"What I mean is, it\u0027s not like you asked for this. You didn\u0027t choose this kind of life, and yet you have to work so hard to be good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know that I\u0027m making up for anything,\" he disagreed lightly. \"Like everything in life, I just had to decide what to do with what I was given.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That makes it sound too easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe examined my arm again. \"There,\" he said, snipping a thread. \"All done.\" He wiped an oversized Q-tip, dripping with some syrup-colored liquid, thoroughly across the operation site. The smell was strange; it made my head spin. The syrup stained my skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the beginning, though,\" I pressed while he taped another long piece of gauze securely in place, sealing it to my skin. \"Why did you even think to try a different way than the obvious one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips turned up in a private smile. \"Hasn\u0027t Edward told you this story?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. But I\u0027m trying to understand what you were thinking��\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was suddenly serious again, and I wondered if his thoughts had gone to the same place that mine had. Wondering what I would be thinking when��I refused to think if��it was me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know my father was a clergyman,\" he mused as he cleaned the table carefully, rubbing everything down with wet gauze, and then doing it again. The smell of alcohol burned in my nose. \"He had a rather harsh view of the world, which I was already beginning to question before the time that I changed.\" Carlisle put all the dirty gauze and the glass slivers into an empty crystal bowl. I didn\u0027t understand what he was doing, even when he lit the match. Then he threw it onto the alcohol-soaked fibers, and the sudden blaze made me jump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" he apologized. \"That ought to do it�� So I didn\u0027t agree with my father\u0027s particular brand of faith. But never, in the nearly four hundred years now since I was born, have I ever seen anything to make me doubt whether God exists in some form or the other. Not even the reflection in the mirror.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pretended to examine the dressing on my arm to hide my surprise at the direction our conversation had taken. Religion was the last thing I expected, all things considered. My own life was fairly devoid of belief. Charlie considered himself a Lutheran, because that\u0027s what his parents had been, but Sundays he worshipped by the river with a fishing pole in his hand. Renee tried out a church now and then, but, much like her brief affairs with tennis, pottery, yoga, and French classes, she moved on by the time I was aware of her newest fad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure all this sounds a little bizarre, coming from a vampire.\" He grinned, knowing how their casual use of that word never failed to shock me. \"But I\u0027m hoping that there is still a point to this life, even for us. It\u0027s a long shot, I\u0027ll admit,\" he continued in an offhand voice. \"By all accounts, we\u0027re damned regardless. But I hope, maybe foolishly, that we\u0027ll get some measure of credit for trying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s foolish,\" I mumbled. I couldn\u0027t imagine anyone, deity included, who wouldn\u0027t be impressed by Carlisle. Besides, the only kind of heaven I could appreciate would have to include Edward. \"And I don\u0027t think anyone else would, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, you\u0027re the very first one to agree with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The rest of them don\u0027t feel the same?\" I asked, surprised, thinking of only one person in particular.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle guessed the direction of my thoughts again. \"Edward\u0027s with me up to a point. God and heaven exist�� and so does hell. But he doesn\u0027t believe there is an afterlife for our kind.\" Carlisle\u0027s voice was very soft; he stared out the big window over the sink, into the darkness. \"You see, he thinks we\u0027ve lost our souls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI immediately thought of Edward\u0027s words this afternoon: unless you want to die��or whatever it is that we do. The lightbulb flicked on over my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the real problem, isn\u0027t it?\" I guessed. \"That\u0027s why he\u0027s being so difficult about me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle spoke slowly. \"I look at my�� son. His strength, his goodness, the brightness that shines out of him��and it only fuels that hope, that faith, more than ever. How could there not be more for one such as Edward?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded in fervent agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if I believed as he does��\" He looked down at me with unfathomable eyes. \"If you believed as he did. Could you take away his soul?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way he phrased the question thwarted my answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he\u0027d asked me whether I would risk my soul for Edward, the reply would be obvious. But would I risk Edward\u0027s soul? I pursed my lips unhappily. That wasn\u0027t a fair exchange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see the problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, aware of the stubborn set of my chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my choice,\" I insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s his, too.\" He held up his hand when he could see that I was about to argue. \"Whether he is responsible for doing that to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not the only one able to do it.\" I eyed Carlisle speculatively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, abruptly lightening the mood. \"Oh, no! You\u0027re going to have to work this out with him.\"But then he sighed. \"That\u0027s the one part I can never be sure of. I think, in most other ways, that I\u0027ve done the best I could with what I had to work with. But was it right to doom the others to this life? I can\u0027t decide.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t answer. I imagined what my life would be like if Carlisle had resisted the temptation to change his lonely existence�� and shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was Edward\u0027s mother who made up my mind.\" Carlisle\u0027s voice was almost a whisper. He stared unseeingly out the black windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His mother?\" Whenever I\u0027d asked Edward about his parents, he would merely say that they had died long ago, and his memories were vague. I realized Carlisle\u0027s memory of them, despite the brevity of their contact, would be perfectly clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Her name was Elizabeth. Elizabeth Masen. His father, Edward Senior, never regained consciousness in the hospital. He died in the first wave of the influenza. But Elizabeth was alert until almost the very end. Edward looks a great deal like her��she had that same strange bronze shade to her hair, and her eyes were exactly the same color green.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His eyes were green?\" I murmured, trying to picture it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes��\" Carlisle\u0027s ocher eyes were a hundred years away now. \"Elizabeth worried obsessively over her son. She hurt her own chances of survival trying to nurse him from her sickbed. I expected that he would go first, he was so much worse off than she was. When the end came for her, it was very quick. It was just after sunset, and I\u0027d arrived to relieve the doctors who\u0027d been working all day. That was a hard time to pretend��there was so much work to be done, and I had no need of rest. How I hated to go back to my house, to hide in the dark and pretend to sleep while so many were dying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I went to check Elizabeth and her son first. I\u0027d grown attached��always a dangerous thing to do considering the fragile nature of humans. I could see at once that she\u0027d taken a bad turn. The fever was raging out of control, and her body was too weak to fight anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She didn\u0027t look weak, though, when she glared up at me from her cot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Save him!\u0027 she commanded me in the hoarse voice that was all her throat could manage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do everything in my power,\u0027 I promised her, taking her hand. The fever was so high, she probably couldn\u0027t even tell how unnaturally cold mine felt. Everything felt cold to her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must,\" she insisted, clutching at my hand with enough strength that I wondered if she wouldn\u0027t pull through the crisis after all. Her eyes were hard, like stones, like emeralds. \u0027You must do everything in your power. What others cannot do, that is what you must do for my Edward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It frightened me. She looked it me with those piercing eyes, and, for one instant, I felt certain that she knew my secret. Then the fever overwhelmed her, and she never regained consciousness. She died within an hour of making her demand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d spent decades considering the idea of creating a companion for myself. Just one other creature who could really know me, rather than what I pretended to be. But I could never justify it to myself��doing what had been done to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There Edward lay, dying. It was clear that he had only hours left. Beside him, his mother, her face somehow not yet peaceful, not even in death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle saw it all again, his memory unblurred by the intervening century. I could see it clearly, too, as he spoke��the despair of the hospital, the overwhelming atmosphere of death. Edward burning with fever, his life slipping away with each tick of the clock�� I shuddered again, and forced the picture from my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elizabeth\u0027s words echoed in my head. How could she guess what I could do? Could anyone really want that for her son?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I looked at Edward. Sick as he was, he was still beautiful. There was something pure and good about his face. The kind of face I would have wanted my son to have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After all those years of indecision, I simply acted on a whim. I wheeled his mother to the morgue first, and then I came back for him. No one noticed that he was still breathing. There weren\u0027t enough hands, enough eyes, to keep track of half of what the patients needed. The morgue was empty��of the living, at least. I stole him out the back door, and carried him across the rooftops back to my home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t sure what had to be done. I settled for recreating the wounds I\u0027d received myself, so many centuries earlier in London. I felt bad about that later. It was more painful and lingering than necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t sorry, though. I\u0027ve never been sorry that I saved Edward.\" He shook his head, coming back to the present. He smiled at me. \"I suppose I should take you home now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do that,\" Edward said. He came through the shadowy dining room, walking slowly for him. His face was smooth, unreadable, but there was something wrong with his eyes��something he was trying very hard to hide. I felt a spasm of unease in my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Carlisle can take me,\" I said. I looked down at my shirt; the light blue cotton was soaked and spotted with my blood. My right shoulder was covered in thick pink frosting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine.\" Edward\u0027s voice was unemotional. \"You\u0027ll need to change anyway. You\u0027d give Charlie a heart attack the way you look. I\u0027ll have Alice get you something.\" He strode out the kitchen door again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Carlisle anxiously. \"He\u0027s very upset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Carlisle agreed. \"Tonight is exactly the kind of thing that he fears the most. You being put in danger, because of what we are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not his fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not yours, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked away from his wise, beautiful eyes. I couldn\u0027t agree with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle offered me his hand and helped me up from the table. I followed him out into the main room. Esme had come back; she was mopping the floor where I\u0027d fallen��with straight bleach from the smell of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Esme, let me do that.\" I could feel that my face was bright red again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m already done.\" She smiled up at me. \"How do you feel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine,\" I assured her. \"Carlisle sews faster than any other doctor I\u0027ve had.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice and Edward came in the back doors. Alice hurried to my side, but Edward hung back, his face indecipherable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"C\u0027mon,\" Alice said. \"I\u0027ll get you something less macabre to wear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found me a shirt of Esme\u0027s that was close to the same color mine had been. Charlie wouldn\u0027t notice, I was sure. The long white bandage on my arm didn\u0027t look nearly as serious when I was no longer spattered in gore. Charlie was never surprised to see me bandaged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alice,\" I whispered as she headed back to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" She kept her voice low, too, and looked at me curiously, her head cocked to the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How bad is it?\" I couldn\u0027t be sure if my whispering was a wasted effort. Even though we were upstairs, with the door closed, perhaps he could hear me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face tensed. \"I\u0027m not sure yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s Jasper?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. \"He\u0027s very unhappy with himself. It\u0027s all so much more of challenge for him, and he hates feeling weak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not his fault. You\u0027ll tell him that I\u0027m not mad at him, not at all, won\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward was waiting for me by the front door. As I got to the bottom of the staircase, he held it open without a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take your things!\" Alice cried as I walked warily toward Edward. She scooped up the two packages, one half-opened, and my camera from under the piano, and pressed them into my good arm. \"You can thank me later, when you\u0027ve opened them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEsme and Carlisle both said a quiet goodnight. I could see them stealing quick glances at their impassive son, much like I was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a relief to be outside; I hurried past the lanterns and the roses, now unwelcome reminders. Edward kept pace with me silently. He opened the passenget side for me, and I climbed in without\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecomplaint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the dashboard was a big red ribbon, stuck to the new stereo. I pulled it off, throwing it to the floor. As Edward slid into the other side, I kicked the ribbon under my seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t look at me or the stereo. Neither of us switched it on, and the silence was somehow intensified by the sudden thunder of the engine. He drove too fast down the dark, serpentine lane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence was making me insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say something,\" I finally begged as he turned onto the freeway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want me to say?\" he asked in a detached voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cringed at his remoteness. \u0027Tell me you forgive me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat brought a flicker of life to his face��a flicker of anger. \"Forgive you? For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I\u0027d been more careful, nothing would have happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella, you gave yourself a paper cut��that hardly deserves the death penalty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s still my fault.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy words opened up the floodgate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your fault? If you\u0027d cut yourself at Mike Newton\u0027s house, with Jessica there and Angela and your other normal friends, the worst that could possibly have happened would be what? Maybe they couldn\u0027t find you a bandage? If you\u0027d tripped and knocked over a pile of glass plates on your own��without someone throwing you into them��even then, what\u0027s the worst? You\u0027d get blood on the seats when they drove you to the emergency room? Mike Newton could have held your hand while they stitched you up��and he wouldn\u0027t be righting the urge to kill you the whole time he was there. Don\u0027t try to take any of this on yourself, Bella. It will only make me more disgusted with myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How the hell did Mike Newton end up in this conversation?\" I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mike Newton ended up in this conversation because Mike Newton would be a hell of a lot healthier for you to be with,\" he growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d rather die than be with Mike Newton,\" I protested. \"I\u0027d rather die than be with anyone but you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be melodramatic, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well then, don\u0027t you be ridiculous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer. He glared through the windshield, his expression black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI racked my brain for some way to salvage the evening. When we pulled up in front of my house, I still hadn\u0027t come up with anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe killed the engine, but his hands stayed clenched around the steering wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you stay tonight?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last thing I wanted was for him to go wallow in remorse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For my birthday,\" I pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t have it both ways��either you want people to ignore your birthday or you don\u0027t. One or the other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was stern, but not .is serious as before. I breathed a silent sigh of relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. I\u0027ve decided that I don\u0027t want you to ignore my birthday. I\u0027ll see you upstairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hopped out, reaching back in for my packages. He frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to take those.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want them,\" I responded automatically, and then wondered if he was using reverse psychology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, you don\u0027t. Carlisle and Esme spent money on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll live.\" I tucked the presents awkwardly under my good arm and slammed the door behind me. He was out of the truck and by my side in less than a second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me carry them, at least.\" he said as he took them away. \"I\u0027ll be in your room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. \"Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Happy birthday,\" he sighed, and leaned down to touch his lips to mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached up on my toes to make the kiss last longer when he pulled away. He smiled my favorite crooked smile, and then he disappeared into the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe game was still on; as soon as I walked through the front door I could hear the announcer rambling over the babble of the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bell?\" Charlie called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Dad,\" I said as I came around the corner. I held my arm close to my side. The slight pressure burned, and I wrinkled my nose. The anesthetic was apparently losing its effectiveness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How was it?\" Charlie lounged across the sofa with his bare feet propped up on the arm. What was left of his curly brown hair was crushed flat on one side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alice went overboard. Flowers, cake, candles, presents��the whole bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did they get you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A stereo for my truck.\" And various unknowns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I agreed. \"Well, I\u0027m calling it a night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see you in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waved. \"See ya.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to your arm?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flushed and cursed silently. \"I tripped. It\u0027s nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella,\" he sighed, shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goodnight, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hurried up to the bathroom, where I kept my pajamas for just such nights as these. I shrugged into the matching tank top and cotton pants that I\u0027d gotten to replace the holey sweats I used to wear to bed, wincing as the movement pulled at the stitches. I washed my face one-handed, brushed my teeth, and then skipped to my room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was sitting in the center of my bed, toying idly with one of the silver boxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" he said. His voice was sad. He was wallowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to the bed, pushed the presents out of his hands, and climbed into his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi.\" I snuggled into his stone chest. \"Can I open my presents now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did the enthusiasm come from?\" he wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You made me curious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI picked up the long flat rectangle that must have been from Carlisle and Esme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allow me,\" he suggested. He took the gift from my hand and tore the silver paper off with one fluid movement. He handed the rectangular white box back to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure I can handle lifting the lid?\" I muttered, but he ignored me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the box was a long thick piece of paper with an overwhelming amount of fine print. It took me a minute to get the gist of the information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to Jacksonville?\" And I was excited, in spite of myself. It was a voucher for plane tickets, for both me and Edward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe it. Renee is going to flip! You don\u0027t mind, though, do you? It\u0027s sunny, you\u0027ll have to stay inside all day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I can handle it,\" he said, and then frowned. \"If I\u0027d had any idea that you could respond to a gift this appropriately, I would have made you open it in front of Carlisle and Esme. I thought you\u0027d complain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, of course it\u0027s too much. But I get to take you with me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled. \"Now I wish I\u0027d spent money on your present. I didn\u0027t realize that you were capable of being reasonable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set the tickets aside and reached for his present, my curiosity rekindled. He took it from me and unwrapped it like the first one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe handed back a clear CD jewel case, with a blank silver CD inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" I asked, perplexed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t say anything; he took the CD and reached around me to put it in the CD player on the bedside table. He hit play, and we waited in silence. Then the music began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI listened, speechless and wide-eyed. I knew he was waiting for my reaction, but I couldn\u0027t talk. Tears welled up, and I reached up to wipe them away before they could spill over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does your arm hurt?\" he asked anxiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s not my arm. It\u0027s beautiful, Edward. You couldn\u0027t have given me anything I would love more. I can\u0027t believe it.\" I shut up, so I could listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was his music, his compositions. The first piece on the CD was my lullaby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t think you would let me get a piano so I could play for you here,\" he explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How does your arm feel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just fine.\" Actually, it was starting to blaze under the bandage. I wanted ice. I would have settled for his hand, but that would have given me away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get you some Tylenol.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need anything,\" I protested, but he slid me off his lap and headed for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Charlie,\" I hissed. Charlie wasn\u0027t exactly aware that Edward frequently stayed over. In fact, he would have a stroke if that fact were brought to his attention. But I didn\u0027t feel too guilty for deceiving him It wasn\u0027t as if we were up to anything he wouldn\u0027t want me to be up to. Edward and his rules��\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t catch me,\" Edward promised as he disappeared silently out the door . . and returned, catching the door before it had swung back to touch the frame. He had the glass from the bathroom and the bottle of pills in one hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took the pills he handed me without arguing��I knew I would lose the argument And my arm really was starting to bother me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lullaby continued, soft and lovely, in the background.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s late,\" Edward noted. He scooped me up off the bed with one arm, and pulled the cover back with the other. He put me down with my head on my pillow and tucked the quilt around me. He lay down next to me��on top of the blanket so I wouldn\u0027t get chilled��and put his arm over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned my head against his shoulder and sighed happily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks again,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re welcome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was quiet for a long moment as I listened to my lullaby drift to a close. Another song began. I recognized Esme\u0027s favorite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you thinking about?\u0027\" I wondered in a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated for a second before he told me. \"I was thinking about right and wrong, actually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt a chill tingle along my spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember how I decided that I wanted you to not ignore my birthday?\" I asked quickly, hoping it wasn\u0027t too clear that I was trying to distract him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" he agreed, wary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I was thinking, since it\u0027s still my birthday, that I\u0027d like you to kiss me again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re greedy tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I am��but please, don\u0027t do anything you don\u0027t want to do,\" I added, piqued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, and then sighed. \"Heaven forbid that I should do anything I don\u0027t want to do,\" he said in a strangely desperate tone as he put his hand under my chin and pulled my face up to his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kiss began much the same as usual��Edward was as careful as ever, and my heart began to overreact like it always did. And then something seemed to change. Suddenly his lips became much more urgent, his free hand twisted into my hair and held my face securely to his. And, though my hands tangled in his hair, too, and though I was clearly beginning to cross his cautious lines, for once he didn\u0027t stop me. His body was cold through the thin quilt, but I crushed myself against him eagerly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he stopped it was abrupt; he pushed me away with gentle, firm hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI collapsed back onto my pillow, gasping, my head spinning. Something tugged at my memory, elusive, on the edges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" he said, and he was breathless, too. \"That was out of line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t mind,\" I panted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned at me in the darkness. \"Try to sleep. Bella.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I want you to kiss me again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re overestimating my self-control.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is tempting you more, my blood or my body?\" I challenged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a tie.\" He grinned briefly in spite of himself, and then was serious again. \"Now. why don\u0027t you stop pushing your luck and go to sleep?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" I agreed, snuggling closer to him. I really did feel exhausted. It had been a long day in so many ways, yet I felt no sense of relief at its end. Almost as if something worse was coming tomorrow. It was a silly premonition��what could be worse than today?\u0027 Just the shock catching up with me, no doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrying to be sneaky about it, I pressed my injured arm against his shoulder, so his cool skin would sooth the burning. It felt better at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was halfway asleep, maybe more, when I realized what his kiss had reminded me of: last spring, when he\u0027d had to leave me to throw James off my trail, Edward had kissed me goodbye, not knowing when��or if��we would see each other again. This kiss had the same almost painful edge for some reason I couldn\u0027t imagine. I shuddered into unconsciousness, as if I were already having a nightmare. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-2-new-moon-twilight-2/page-3.html","bookId":2024,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:12:55 PM"}
