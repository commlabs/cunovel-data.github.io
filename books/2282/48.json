If so, he assumed it meant she was sneaking out of the house, heading over to the stables to get Firewalker and take off into the night, carrying her information to the patriots at Valley Forge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere had been no other activity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt a touch on his shoulder. “Give it a rest,” Logan said. “Start over in the morning. Standish survived and he has two of the best guards around. Get some sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyler nodded. “Thanks,” he told Logan huskily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison was already upstairs in Lucy’s room. He found her in bed, wide-eyed and waiting for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Should I be here?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyler felt the day’s tension, his own self-reproach, fall away as if he’d shed an irritating coat. She had that effect on him. It wasn’t that she made him forget; she made him see more clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m grateful you are,” he said, “and there’s nowhere else I think you should be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stripped off his clothing and lay down beside her. He touched her hair softly, looking into the deep blue of her eyes, getting lost in them. “So, the last man you were seeing was something of a rock star, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was a while ago now,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What was he like?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good guy, nice guy, but for the longest time, I thought there was something wrong with me. He’d plan to pick me up and wouldn’t show. At that point I knew about the alcohol but not about the drugs. Later on, I went to a few Narcotics Anonymous meetings. And I knew he cared about me, but he refused to acknowledge the addictions. I ended the relationship. I don’t know what he’s doing now. I pray he’s alive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stroked her hair. “It’s a terrible thing, addiction,” he told her, drawing her close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lay against him for a minute in silence, a silence that seemed relaxed and comfortable. Pulling her closer he kissed the top of her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stirred, and he kissed her again. He felt her naked body slide against his, and her slightest touch was instant arousal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe loved the fact that she could make the world go away. And that she could so easily return to it. He found himself wondering if she’d ever leave her beloved Philadelphia. Virginia wasn’t that far, but…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe forgot the past and future as they made love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then they slept peacefully together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the middle of the night, he felt her move. He woke as she slipped out from the covers and stood there for a moment, framed in the pale moonlight that filtered through the drapes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked away from him. Tyler rose quickly, watching her; she wasn’t awake, he thought. She wasn’t aware of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a few seconds he was afraid she’d take off through the night stark naked. She didn’t. She went to the foot of the bed and pulled on her robe, although she didn’t bother with slippers. She hurried across the room to the wall where there was nothing—nothing that he could see. She bent to pick up something, cradling it tenderly against her body. She paused, head bent, as if she was praying, and then hurried to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grabbed his own robe, throwing it on. Allison opened the door and eased through. In the hallway she paused again, as if listening for others in the household.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked carefully down the stairs and went to stand in the entrance to the study, looking into the darkened room. Then she ran down the hallway to the back door. The alarm was keyed; she wasn’t going to stop to put in the code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe realized that to Allison, at that moment, there was no code. She was seeing the house through the memory of another woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucy Tarleton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slipped ahead of her, tapping in the alarm code just in time. Allison opened the back door and stepped into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved forward and handed whatever she was carrying to someone who was invisible to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA second later she stepped back, tears in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyler felt as if a rush of wind swept by him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Allison burst into tears and sank to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e17\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy then, the others were up. Tyler bent down beside Allison, drawing her to her feet. He brought an arm around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She gave the baby away. She carried her baby out in the middle of the night and she gave him away,” Allison said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. I saw,” Tyler told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked baffled. “It’s true. It’s really true. She gave the baby to the Leigh family, my family, and all these years, none of us had any idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As we’ve said many times, history is always told by the victors,” Tyler said. “I suppose Lucy’s patriot family didn’t want it known she’d had a bastard child—especially since the baby’s father was one of the enemy. It ruined the romance and drama of her heroism in their eyes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But what about Bradley? He must have known. Do you think that’s what sent him into a frenzy—why he killed her?” Allison asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, let’s get inside. It’s cold out here,” Jane said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKat was just inside the door. “Do you suppose that’s why people have been killed through the years?” she asked. “I studied those autopsy reports inside and out. The deaths look like they were accidental, but…faulty wiring caused the college student’s death? At a historic property that’s inspected all the time? Or tripping down the stairs?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Could this be the reason?” Tyler gestured at Allison. “I think we’re looking for a truly obsessed killer who is devious, as well. And if—” He paused, aware that everyone was watching him. “And if it’s because Allison really is a descendent of Lucy Tarleton, she’s the one who matters. That would point to Cherry Addison. Not to mention the fact that her husband is an artist and she could have gotten him to paint a replica portrait.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then we announce tomorrow that we suspect Allison Leigh is a descendent of Lucy Tarleton’s,” Logan said. “We make an announcement to the media—and see what crawls out of the woodwork.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will that make the killer more desperate?” Jane asked. “Or will it just mean that the truth is out—and he’ll disappear and we’ll never know who he is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe we should make the announcement to the surviving guides and board members first,” Kat suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Tyler agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, we’ll set it up for tomorrow night,” Logan said. “During the day, we need to watch the board. Whoever was in the woods with Martin Standish is going to want to know if he survived or not. I left word with the hospital to report his condition as critical. We’ll keep an eye on the board—and on Jason and Annette—and plan on having them over for after-dinner coffee. We’ll present this information to them and see what kind of reaction we get.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t think that’s the motive,” Allison said, wiping her face. She shrugged. “I mean, I don’t believe people were killed because of Lucy’s baby. There’s another possible spin to this story. Maybe the baby wasn’t Beast Bradley’s child, but Stewart Douglas’s. I can’t tell anyone, other than you, that I saw and acted out what happened the night Lucy gave her baby away. She sensed danger in the house. If she was afraid Beast Bradley would kill not just her but the child, as well, that would make her actions more heroic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, the only person who might be distressed by the evidence that Lucy did have an illegitimate child would be…Cherry,” Kat said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If that’s not the reason for the murders, what is?” Tyler asked, frustrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I say we tell the world we’re going to have Lucy disinterred so we can do DNA tests on her and Allison, and prove it to all and sundry,” Logan said. “I’d like to see how Cherry takes the news.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We don’t really have to dig her up, do we?” Allison asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think that’ll be your choice in the end,” Logan told her. “For the moment, it’s a carrot…dangled in someone’s face.” He smiled. “If you’re game to try it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess I’m game for anything at this point.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulian had been standing by Jane. “Thank you,” he said quietly. “I need to know the truth, Allison. I don’t want to hurt anyone, and I don’t want anyone else hurt. I don’t know exactly what it is, but I need…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Justice,” Tyler said. “We seek justice. For the living—and the dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison was nervous the next morning but she called Jason Lawrence and Annette Fanning while Logan phoned Cherry, Ethan Oxford and Nathan Pierson. They explained that they were going to talk to those most closely associated with the house before giving new information to the press. Annette and Jason both sounded curious and nothing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyler suggested they go to the hospital and check on Artie Dixon’s condition. Tyler sent Jane and Kat on a drive out to Valley Forge to meet with local police—and to check that nothing at Martin Standish’s little museum had been touched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the hospital, Haley Dixon looked more worn than ever. Once again, Tyler coaxed her into coming to the cafeteria with him, while Allison sat down and held Dixon’s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA young woman poked her head in and introduced herself as Dixon’s nurse for the day, telling her the LPN’s name was on the board, if she needed assistance. “We monitor the vitals at all times, of course, out at the nurses’ station, but hit the button if you need us.” She rolled her eyes. “We’ve had all kinds of codes going today—reds and greens. Those are hostile or combative patients. You wouldn’t believe how many people come in for help and then want to knock out their doctors and nurses!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison smiled sympathetically and thanked her. As she sat down, she heard the warning, “Code green!” over the loudspeaker. Nurses and orderlies were running down the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison concentrated on Artie Dixon, talking to him quietly and earnestly, asking him to speak to her with his mind. He did, but he was still obsessed with the painting. “Lies—what we see is all lies,” Dixon told her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-uninvited-krewe-of-hunters-8/page-48.html","bookId":2282,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:29 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:29 PM"}
