Elar and her kil -crazed sisters were at every available window slit, hosing whatever was out there while the unlucky Elites who’d managed to breach the building were a messy heap on the floor. Some of the smal er kids clustered around to look, as if there wasn’t a pitched battle going on. “They’ve got to be running out of men soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDevereaux cut in on the circuit. “Mal, I’m going to push them back the hard way. They’re right at the door, so watch for shrapnel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeters from the door, stone and soil fountained into the air in a stream of explosions like firecrackers detonating. Vaz saw the hinge-heads outside dive for cover. Some made it; some didn’t. Behind him, the snarling and fighting continued but the firing had stopped dead. Naomi thudded down beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now,” she said. “Move now. There’s about twenty left outside. We can take them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoom. Something detonated above their heads. BB said something, but Vaz didn’t catch it. Then he saw a Banshee streak east again, skimming the tree line, and Dev started swearing blue murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bastard hit my tail,” she said. “I’m losing coolant. Hey, asshole, you want to make yourself useful? Go get the goddamn Banshee.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVaz heard a painful y high-pitched shriek of an engine as it pul ed away. “Dev, can you drop an Anvil out front?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you want to risk bringing down the keep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just clear a space.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBB cut in. “Everybody cover, ” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn Anvil missile was the last thing Vaz wanted to see detonate on his front doorstep. Phillips. No armor. The thought overrode everything else and he flung himself on the professor just as the blast hit his visor like a blizzard. The debris seemed to rain for ages. He tried to get up and found himself springing to his feet with easy, unexpected energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was Naomi. She held him up by his webbing. “Get going,” she said, and scooped Phil ips up under one arm like a naughty toddler who was now in serious trouble. He wasn’t dead or bleeding, anyway. He was stil moving. “Dev, we’re coming out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMal was up and running. Vaz stumbled after him. He couldn’t see where the Banshee or the Phantom had gone, but he could see Tart-Cart waiting on the other side of a crater twice the size of a swimming pool, and Naomi sprinting toward it with Phil ips. Then a huge hand clamped down on Vaz’s shoulder and spun him around. Elar, the mouthiest of the hinge-head girls, loomed in his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You destroy our land and then you run away.” She pointed behind her but he couldn’t see anything. He could hear more Elites shouting as they ran, though, male. “My children and my sisters can’t defend themselves against an entire keep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t Vaz’s problem. He shook her off. “Not my war,” he said. “I’ve got one of my own. Sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could have ripped his head from his shoulders. He knew that for sure now. But she didn’t, and he ran for the dropship. Mal pul ed him into the crew bay and Devereaux took off so fast that he fel across the seats. The last thing he saw below was an al -too-familiar sea of armored heads thrust forward from massive shoulders as another wave of hinge-heads made their way to the keep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve got to fix this leak,” Devereaux said. “BB, let me know when you see a quiet spot where I can set down. Otherwise we’re not going to make it out of orbit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhil ips was almost forgotten for the moment. He sat on the bench seat, stil clutching his plasma pistol and looking up at Naomi like he was expecting her to put him over her knee and slap his ass. She took the pistol off him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks,” he said sheepishly. “My radio went down and BB’s fragment is total y screwed, but you should see some of the stuff I’ve found. Halo data.” He looked past Naomi at the hatch, stil open to the air. “They’re going to be slaughtered down there. Can’t we do anything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re not here to do peacekeeping. We came to save your arse.” Mal lifted off his helmet and tried to peer out of the hatch. “Where’s that bloody Phantom now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fol owing us,” said Devereaux.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUNSC INFINITY, SOMEWHERE IN SLIPSPACE Andrew Del Rio sat at the comms console with an expression of confidence welded seamlessly to his face, but it didn’t fool Parangosky one bit. He clenched his jaw for a moment, then opened the ship’s broadcast system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Safeguard in force,” he said. It was the signal to al hands that the exercise was suspended and that they were deploying for real. This was no longer a dril . “Safeguard, safeguard, safeguard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to be terrified. He had a temporary AI, a skeleton crew, two admirals breathing down his neck, and a new, largely untested ship running on alien technology that didn’t have a manual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd when Infinity dropped out of slip—if things went to plan—she’d be right in the middle of a civil war, tasked to defend a former enemy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that’s what I call the pucker factor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bracing, isn’t it?” Parangosky walked up behind his seat more slowly than she actual y needed to and leaned close enough to his ear for him to feel her breath. “I haven’t been on deck for a shooting war in decades.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDel Rio was staring into the unbroken blackness ahead. She watched his Adam’s apple slide just a fraction as he swal owed discreetly. When she was thirty and good-looking, it was a tactic that could be misunderstood, but now that she was beyond old and her glitteringly black history of vengeance was known throughout the fleet, it could only be interpreted as menace. Del Rio got the message loud and clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m glad that you trust my abilities enough to take this risk,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe inhaled silently: sandalwood soap, coffee, and mint. “I wouldn’t miss this for the world, Andrew.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe straightened up and took a seat to his right just as Hood arrived on the bridge. Lasky was standing at the navigation console with Glassman and Nguyen as they watched the readouts, hands together and forefingers resting on his top lip. He looked like a smal boy praying for a bike for Christmas. This was the test. This would prove whether the Forerunner drive enhancement and slipspace plotting would drop them exactly where and when they’d planned to be. Parangosky almost al owed herself a little shiver of excitement. One of the Huragok came onto the bridge and drifted along the rows of instruments like a highly decorative ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fifty seconds, sir,” Lasky said. “Engineering stand by … forty … thirty…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAine took over the count. Lasky didn’t seem to be expecting that. She was probably making the point that she stil had a job to do, civil war or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Twenty-nine…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, Aine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Twenty … ten … five, four, three, two … and we’re back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParangosky didn’t feel the slightest hint of giddiness as the ship dropped back into realspace. One moment Infinity was in one dimension and the next she was in another, as smooth and instant as a blink. The black void fil ed up with stars and skeins of glowing gas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that was just the backdrop. Sanghelios hung in the foreground, a fox-red crescent curled around a handful of brightly lit cities, the first time that Parangosky—or any of the ship’s company, come to that—had seen the enemy homeworld with the naked eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Positional deviation—less than one kilometer, relative to target,” Glassman said. Somebody out of Parangosky’s eye line clapped a couple of times. “Time deviation—under one second. We’re on the nail, sir. Absolutely on it.” Glassman turned around and smiled at Parangosky, either being politic or acknowledging another member of the Halsey Haters Club, and then at Hood. She noted the order of precedence there. “How’s that, ma’am, sir?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Worth the wait,” Hood said. “Congratulations. Please pass a sincere Bravo Zulu to your team.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDel Rio stood up, looking ten years younger. “Wel , goddamn, it works, ” he said. “That and the comms. Shame we can’t rol back time and fight this war again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At least we won’t have to fight another one at a disadvantage.” Parangosky caught Lasky’s eye and winked. “And I’m sure the Arbiter wil gaze upon our capacity, and learn to wind his damned neck in lest we come back in a less friendly frame of mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bridge was ful of young lieutenants. They looked at her as if she’d revealed God’s middle name. Hood gave her his don’t-corrupt-the- children look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need to talk to Captain Osman, so I’m going to scuttle off to my cabin,” she said, easing herself up with the aid of her cane. Nobody expected ONI to discuss anything in front of Fleet, not even the sports results. “I’l be with you shortly. And I’l expect a fresh pot of coffee.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven with a buggy, it took longer than she liked to reach the senior officers’ cabins. When the door recognized her and let her in, BB was already in the system and waiting to patch her through to Osman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“BB, I hope you haven’t been irritating poor Aine again.” She sat down on the sofa and beckoned the screen to move across to her position. “You know how uneasy she gets about things she can’t catalog.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been as good as gold, ma’am. She didn’t even know I was there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Secure voice-coded link, please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right … Captain Osman for you…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOsman’s seat was empty when the link activated. Parangosky heard the rustle of fabric and the captain slid into the seat, looking interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, ma’am,” Osman said. “I had to see it for myself. I was looking at Infinity. Six klicks long doesn’t hit home until you see her at relatively close quarters.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Impressive, isn’t she?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I take it that wasn’t meant to be a stealth approach. Because that was one hel of an entrance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Absolutely accurate reentry. I’l be cross-decking some goodies for you later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kilo-Five’s pul ed Phil ips out, by the way, but they’ve had to land to make repairs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No injuries, I hope.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“None that they’re admitting to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re standing by if they need help.” Parangosky wondered if that might be a job for Adj, but it was a huge risk now to take him into Sangheili territory. “I haven’t had time to look at the sitrep on ‘Telcam, but I take it he’s stil making inroads. How many cities involved now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“From what we can see, it’s certainly not global. But it’s six major centers, stil concentrated on the Vadam region. The Arbiter can’t hold out much longer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wel , Hood’s come to the rescue, but you’re going to have to make sure that he’s not too successful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParangosky had never been too squeamish to thwart other branches of UNSC to achieve ONI’s aims, and she knew damned wel that any of her opposite numbers would have done exactly the same to her given half a chance. But ONI had never pul ed a trigger to counter them during the Covenant War, even via a third party. Now she’d be doing exactly that, even if she wasn’t going to target Infinity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, ma’am,” Osman said. “I’ve been wargaming the worst scenario.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can have the best of al worlds. We need to degrade what’s left of Sangheili space capability, but we have to degrade it equal y on both sides, which is general y harder in practice than it sounds.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Understood. But concealing that from Infinity might be hard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’l take care of that. I’m sure BB can muddy the waters somehow. Now, what about Kilo-Five?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want them stranded down there after we’re seen to take sides and kil Sangheili.” Osman looked down at her hands for a moment. Maybe she was checking for that ONI stain. “They’ve gathered some useful data from the Forerunner structures that might be about the remaining Halos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBB’s got the file. The Huragok might be able to unpick it further. We’ve not had a chance to extract Phil ips’s data yet because of the problem with BB’s fragment.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you al right, Captain?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“About kil ing Sangheili al ies? Yes. Absolutely. They were ready to wipe out every last human in the galaxy. Nothing’s real y changed. I know my duty. Humans first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I meant your people on the surface.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can handle that, ma’am.” Osman forced a smile but it wasn’t convincing. “By the way, stil no word on Pious Inquisitor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s too big to sneak up on us,” Parangosky said. “Now, we need to move fast. I’ve got two Huragok for you, and they’re going to give Stanley a first-class makeover. Be ready to receive us in fifteen minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Understood, ma’am. Thank you. It’l be good to have Adj back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’l bet. Parangosky out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned back against the upholstery and rehearsed what she’d say if Stanley was caught shooting down one of the Arbiter’s vessels. The corvette could operate in stealth mode, but Infinity had new sensors, and it was hard to keep up with every change the Huragok made. That complicated matters. But once a ship was destroyed, it would never be used against Earth again, and the Sangheili wouldn’t be able to replace ships for many years, if ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsset denial, Terrence. It doesn’t matter how betrayed the Arbiter feels if he doesn’t have the capability to do anything about it. You’ll thank me one day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParangosky didn’t feel guilty about any of it. They were only Sangheili, and slaughtering humans for being humans meant that al morality and consideration of Sangheili as individuals were suspended. This was about the survival of her species. It wasn’t a legal debate. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-the-thursday-war-halo-10/page-30.html","bookId":1640,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:30:57 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:30:57 PM"}
