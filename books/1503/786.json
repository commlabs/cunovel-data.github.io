As for the Peerless Archers, even in the dark of the night, their accuracy was still decent. In such a situation, every salvo of arrows would take away the lives of several thousand enemies.

The previous stern and severe attitude had vanished, replaced with a gentle amiable feeling. Just like what the Six Ultimate Heavenly Emperor Long Shiya had said, no matter who it was, with a son like this, it was definitely something worth being proud of!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eRegarding Princess Difuya breaking the betrothal, Admiral Zhou was slightly unhappy in his heart.

However, when the Heavenly Bow Empire had been in trouble, it was his son who had battled through all odds, experiencing wind and rain before finally succeeding in reviving the Empire. As the Princess of the Empire, what had she done? Perhaps she had not only not contributed, she had even dragged his son back. Such a daughter-in-law, it’s fine if they didn’t get her, since the betrothal was already broken then so be it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Get lost, I don’t have a daughter like you!” Di Lingfeng suddenly raised his leg, sending Difuya tumbling to the ground.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eDifuya was totally stunned by her father’s actions, not even climbing up.

Let me beat her to death now, lest she insults the connection between us.” As he said that, Di Lingfeng drew his longsword, taking a step forward as he slashed downwards at Difuya.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Your Majesty, no!” Everyone cried out in alarm.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIn a flash, Zhou Weiqing held onto Di Lingfeng. “Godfather, what are you doing. Difuya did not do anything wrong. Even before our Empire fell into the mishap, she had not loved me. Everyone has their own likes, and her not liking me does not mean anything. Forced love does not last, furthermore she has already found her own happiness now. Our Heavenly Bow Empire has just revived successfully; these few years she has suffered enough, don’t blame her anymore.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eDi Fengling’s expression was still ugly, but as he was hugged by Zhou Weiqing, he could not break free at all. Under such a circumstance, he could only stop, looking coldly at Difuya, saying: “Get out. I don’t want to see you again. From now on, the Heavenly Bow Empire no longer has you as a Princess.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eDifuya was in shock, looking at her emotionless father, she wept bitterly as she turned and ran out.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Weiqing sighed inwardly. Although he did not like Difuya at all, perhaps even hated her a little, he did not wish to see her end like this. However, Di Lingfeng was currently in a fit of anger, and he knew trying to persuade him was not going to make a difference now.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eDifuya left, and Di Fengling’s expression slowly calmed down. Sighing heavily, he said: “Weiqing, godfather has let you down! It’s all my fault, I never taught her properly since young.” His current emotions could only be described as highly conflicted. If Difuya could really marry Zhou Weiqing, then he could accept all that Zhou Weiqing had done easily. After all, Zhou Weiqing and Difuya’s future child would then inherit the future throne of the Heavenly Bow Empire. But now?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThese few days, Di Lingfeng had already learned clearly the current situation of the Heavenly Bow Empire. It could be said that the Heavenly Bow Empire was in its strongest state in all of history. However, as an Emperor, how much power did he have left? It was not only him, even Admiral Zhou was the same. Although Zhou Weiqing had handed over the all the power in his hands, they were still clear that no one else but Zhou Weiqing could really command the army.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eDi Lingfeng sat there in a daze momentarily. After a while, he seemed to make up his mind. Abruptly, he lifted up his head, looking at Zhou Weiqing and said: “Weiqing, Godfather has already decided. Amongst all my children, there isn’t a single one that is up to the mark, that is the reason why I have not chosen a heir up until now. From today onwards, you will be the crown prince of the Heavenly Bow Empire. After a few days, I will officially pass the throne to you.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Ahh?” Zhou Weiqing was given a fright, and he could only stare with jaw agape at Di Fengling. On the other side, Admiral Zhou knelt down with a thud. “Your Majesty, that’s absolutely impossible.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Weiqing also hurriedly knelt down in front of Di Fengling. “Godfather, all that I did was what I was supposed to do. You can’t do that, and there is no need to. Furthermore, that is not my inclination. If you were to pass such a large Empire to me, what freedom would I have left? Do not worry, I will handle the army. As long as you do not change the commander, put absolute trust like I did in Admiral Ming Yu, then I can guarantee that the Heavenly Bow Empire will only grow stronger.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eDi Lingfeng shook his head, pulling Zhou Weiqing and Admiral Zhou up to their feet. With kindly eyes, he looked at Zhou Weiqing as he said: “Child, I know your heart, but you have already done so much for the Empire. If I do not hand anything over, how could I face the world, the people? You do not need to say anything more, my mind is set. I also believe that if the Heavenly Bow Empire is under your rule, we will eventually become one of the strongest Empires in the entire Boundless Mainland.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eNot only did Zhou Weiqing have the highest popularity in the Heavenly Bow Empire, he had a close connection with several of the larger Empires, including some of the Great Saint Lands. If he were to rule the Heavenly Bow Empire, it would definitely be of greatest benefit to the empire. After some struggle in his heart, Di Fengling made the best decision. After saying those words, he felt as if a load had been lifted from his heart.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Weiqing gave a bitter smile as he said: “No, Godfather, please listen to me. Although I’m not willing to rule the Heavenly Bow Empire, that does not mean I will give up on exerting myself for her sake. This is my consideration. Why is the ZhongTian Empire and WanShou Empire so strong, so powerful? That is because behind them, they have the support of a Great Saint Land. In that case, why don’t we have a Great Saint Land of our own?”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Great Saint Land?” Hearing those words, Admiral Zhou and Di Lingfeng’s eyes lit up.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eZhou Weiqing nodded, saying: “That’s right, a Great Saint Land. Perhaps from the current outlook of things, our power is far from being sufficient. However, the number of Jewel Masters we now have is no less than any large Empire. Of course, we can’t compare with the ZhongTian Empire, but at least we have already surpassed the Fei Li Empire.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“As long as we continue grooming them, we can only grow stronger and stronger.

As time passes, I believe we can grow stronger. Furthermore, I am also a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master already, and I am also able to help those older Heavenly Jewel Master powerhouses extend their lives. Once that news spreads, I believe that it will not take long for us to reach the proper scale of an actual Great Saint Land. Of course, how to actually form and build this up, that will be my problems. As for the Empire, it is still best left to you. Otherwise, wouldn’t I be guilty of plotting to usurp the throne?
