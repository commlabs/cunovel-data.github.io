The twisting pavement led him along hilly curves until the road crested. He knew what was coming up on his left: an opening through the trees with a concrete skirt abutting the road\u0027s asphalt. The skirt seemed to end at a cliff, but Jack knew better. He turned onto it and descended a steep concrete driveway into a former sandpit, a huge excavation maybe seventy or eighty feet deep, with a hodgepodge of buildings backed up against the near wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the buildings were dark. He passed a small fleet of cement-mixer trucks and haulers of various shapes and sizes, all lined up and facing front like grunts awaiting inspection. No moving van in sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled up to the office door of the biggest, tallest building. A sign above it showed a stylized black sun that looked like a sunflower, and the words Wm. Blagden \u0026amp; Sons, Inc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYep. They still ran the place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got out and banged on the door, shouting, \"Anybody there?\" a couple of times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf anyone answered, he\u0027d ask for directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one did. He flashed his penlight on the lock. A Schlage. Good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe parked the Vic behind the mixers. Its black color blended nicely into the shadows. He pulled out his Schlage bump key set and returned to the door. Found one that fit the lock, tapped it with the butt of his Glock, and he was in. The place hadn\u0027t been alarmed on his last trip and didn\u0027t appear to be now. After all, what was there to steal? Sand? Loose cement mix?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack flashed his light around the office. Pretty bare bones: a couple of desks, chairs, computer monitors, filing cabinets. His plan was to find a work order for the date Osala was moved and maybe a delivery address to go along with it. A picture window looked out onto the big building\u0027s wide, open floor. Jack aimed his flash through and the beam picked up ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped out onto the floor and played his beam over it as he approached. A box truck with the Blagden logo on the side. Jack froze as the light picked up something else beyond it. Something big and long and metallic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForcing himself back into motion, he passed the truck and stopped before a large metal tube, maybe twenty feet long and five in diameter, its flanks embossed with odd symbols. Jack knew it well. A year and a half ago he\u0027d come here looking for someone. He\u0027d peeped through the window as this cylinder - standing upright then - had been filled with concrete, unaware that the person he\u0027d come to find was bound inside, and had drowned in the wet mix while Jack watched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wave of sadness rippled through him as he returned to the truck. He grabbed the handles on the rear door and heaved. As it rolled up, he flashed his light into the truck\u0027s bay, revealing stacks of gleaming furniture protected by thick mover\u0027s pads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped back and checked the license plate. It matched the numbers Mack had given him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo ... weeks after loading, Osala\u0027s - Rasalom\u0027s - furniture still hadn\u0027t been delivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hopped into the truck\u0027s cab - it stank of cigarettes - and hunted for papers. None on the seat. In the glove compartment he found maps, matches, and a work order that matched Mack\u0027s copy, but no delivery address. Instead, someone had scrawled Hold until further notice across the bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack had a feeling the \"further notice\" might never come. But even if they eventually unloaded all this at Rasalom\u0027s new digs, when would that be? More weeks? Months? Jack had no way of knowing. And no way to know about the move if and when it happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t set up a stakeout. Not while Rasalom was skulking about, planning who knew what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe returned to the rear of the truck and climbed in. Rasalom\u0027s stuff ... maybe it would give some clue to the guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began inspecting things, then throwing them out - pushing them off the edge of the bed to crash on the concrete floor. Chairs got an immediate heave-ho. Dressers and bureaus first had their drawers pulled out and inspected - all empty - then were dumped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmpty, empty, empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing, nothing, nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he\u0027d finished, he eased himself down amid the splintered remains of the furniture and found himself facing the cylinder. A rush of anger burned away his frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dormentalists had been behind the ritual murder in that tube. The higher-ups behind it had paid, but others hadn\u0027t. William Blagden was a Dormentalist and had been involved, yet life was still business as usual for him. Maybe Jack should do something about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew his next step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe retrieved the matchbook from the glove compartment and then popped the truck\u0027s hood. Took him a moment to find the fuel line, took only a second to cut it. The sharp smell of gasoline spread as it spilled onto the floor. He waited for a good-size puddle to form, then struck a match, lit the book, and tossed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gas went up with a woomp! and Jack headed for the door. Outside, he started his car and waited until the truck\u0027s gas tank exploded, blowing out a number of windows. He watched a little longer, to be sure the building was catching. When he was, he put the Vic in gear and drove away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot at all what he\u0027d come for, but at least the trip hadn\u0027t been a total waste. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-10.html","bookId":2554,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:43:53 AM"}
