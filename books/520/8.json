Six dresses,\n\u003cbr\u003e all new and beautiful and bought for me--not handed down from\n\u003cbr\u003e somebody bigger. Perhaps you don\u0027t realize what a climax that marks\n\u003cbr\u003e in the career of an orphan? You gave them to me, and I am very, very,\n\u003cbr\u003e VERY much obliged. It\u0027s a fine thing to be educated--but nothing\n\u003cbr\u003e compared to the dizzying experience of owning six new dresses. \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Pritchard, who is on the visiting committee, picked them out--\n\u003cbr\u003e not Mrs. Lippett, thank goodness. I have an evening dress, pink mull\n\u003cbr\u003e over silk (I\u0027m perfectly beautiful in that), and a blue church dress,\n\u003cbr\u003e and a dinner dress of red veiling with Oriental trimming (makes\n\u003cbr\u003e me look like a Gipsy), and another of rose-coloured challis,\n\u003cbr\u003e and a grey street suit, and an every-day dress for classes. \n\u003cbr\u003e That wouldn\u0027t be an awfully big wardrobe for Julia Rutledge Pendleton,\n\u003cbr\u003e perhaps, but for Jerusha Abbott--Oh, my!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I suppose you\u0027re thinking now what a frivolous, shallow little\n\u003cbr\u003e beast she is, and what a waste of money to educate a girl?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But, Daddy, if you\u0027d been dressed in checked ginghams all your life,\n\u003cbr\u003e you\u0027d appreciate how I feel. And when I started to the high school,\n\u003cbr\u003e I entered upon another period even worse than the checked ginghams.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The poor box.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e You can\u0027t know how I dreaded appearing in school in those miserable\n\u003cbr\u003e poor-box dresses. I was perfectly sure to be put down in class\n\u003cbr\u003e next to the girl who first owned my dress, and she would whisper\n\u003cbr\u003e and giggle and point it out to the others. The bitterness\n\u003cbr\u003e of wearing your enemies\u0027 cast-off clothes eats into your soul. \n\u003cbr\u003e If I wore silk stockings for the rest of my life, I don\u0027t believe\n\u003cbr\u003e I could obliterate the scar.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e LATEST WAR BULLETIN!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e News from the Scene of Action.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At the fourth watch on Thursday the 13th of November, Hannibal routed\n\u003cbr\u003e the advance guard of the Romans and led the Carthaginian forces\n\u003cbr\u003e over the mountains into the plains of Casilinum. A cohort of light\n\u003cbr\u003e armed Numidians engaged the infantry of Quintus Fabius Maximus. \n\u003cbr\u003e Two battles and light skirmishing. Romans repulsed with heavy losses.\n\u003cbr\u003e I have the honour of being,\n\u003cbr\u003e Your special correspondent from the front,\n\u003cbr\u003e J. Abbott\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e PS. I know I\u0027m not to expect any letters in return, and I\u0027ve\n\u003cbr\u003e been warned not to bother you with questions, but tell me, Daddy,\n\u003cbr\u003e just this once--are you awfully old or just a little old? And are\n\u003cbr\u003e you perfectly bald or just a little bald? It is very difficult\n\u003cbr\u003e thinking about you in the abstract like a theorem in geometry.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Given a tall rich man who hates girls, but is very generous to one\n\u003cbr\u003e quite impertinent girl, what does he look like?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e R.S.V.P.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59730.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
