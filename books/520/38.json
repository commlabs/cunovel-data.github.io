{"id":44704,"no":38,"title":"4th May","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Field Day last Saturday. It was a very spectacular occasion. \n\u003cbr\u003e First we had a parade of all the classes, with everybody dressed\n\u003cbr\u003e in white linen, the Seniors carrying blue and gold Japanese umbrellas,\n\u003cbr\u003e and the juniors white and yellow banners. Our class had crimson balloons--\n\u003cbr\u003e very fetching, especially as they were always getting loose\n\u003cbr\u003e and floating off--and the Freshmen wore green tissue-paper hats\n\u003cbr\u003e with long streamers. Also we had a band in blue uniforms hired\n\u003cbr\u003e from town. Also about a dozen funny people, like downs in a circus,\n\u003cbr\u003e to keep the spectators entertained between events.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Julia was dressed as a fat country man with a linen duster and\n\u003cbr\u003e whiskers and baggy umbrella. Patsy Moriarty (Patrici really. \n\u003cbr\u003e Did you ever hear such a name? Mrs. Lippett couldn\u0027t have done better)\n\u003cbr\u003e who is tall and thin was Julia\u0027s wife in a absurd green bonnet\n\u003cbr\u003e over one ear. Waves of laughter followed them the whole length\n\u003cbr\u003e of the course. Julia played the part extremely well. I never\n\u003cbr\u003e dreamed that a Pendleton could display so much comedy spirit--\n\u003cbr\u003e begging Master Jervie\u0027 pardon; I don\u0027t consider him a true\n\u003cbr\u003e Pendleton though, an more than I consider you a true Trustee.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Sallie and I weren\u0027t in the parade because we were entered for\n\u003cbr\u003e the events. And what do you think? We both won! At least\n\u003cbr\u003e in something. We tried for the running broad jump and lost;\n\u003cbr\u003e but Sallie won the pole-vaulting (seven feet three inches)\n\u003cbr\u003e and I won the fifty-yard sprint (eight seconds).\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I was pretty panting at the end, but it was great fun, with the\n\u003cbr\u003e whole class waving balloons and cheering and yelling:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What\u0027s the matter with Judy Abbott?\n\u003cbr\u003e She\u0027s all right.\n\u003cbr\u003e Who\u0027s all right?\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy Ab-bott!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That, Daddy, is true fame. Then trotting back to the dressing tent\n\u003cbr\u003e and being rubbed down with alcohol and having a lemon to suck. \n\u003cbr\u003e You see we\u0027re very professional. It\u0027s a fine thing to win an event\n\u003cbr\u003e for your class, because the class that wins the most gets the athletic\n\u003cbr\u003e cup for the year. The Seniors won it this year, with seven events\n\u003cbr\u003e to their credit. The athletic association gave a dinner in the\n\u003cbr\u003e gymnasium to all of the winners. We had fried soft-shell crabs,\n\u003cbr\u003e and chocolate ice-cream moulded in the shape of basket balls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I sat up half of last night reading Jane Eyre. Are you old enough,\n\u003cbr\u003e Daddy, to remember sixty years ago? And, if so, did people talk\n\u003cbr\u003e that way?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The haughty Lady Blanche says to the footman, `Stop your chattering,\n\u003cbr\u003e knave, and do my bidding.\u0027 Mr. Rochester talks about the metal\n\u003cbr\u003e welkin when he means the sky; and as for the mad woman who laughs\n\u003cbr\u003e like a hyena and sets fire to bed curtains and tears up wedding\n\u003cbr\u003e veils and BITES--it\u0027s melodrama of the purest, but just the same,\n\u003cbr\u003e you read and read and read. I can\u0027t see how any girl could have written\n\u003cbr\u003e such a book, especially any girl who was brought up in a churchyard. \n\u003cbr\u003e There\u0027s something about those Brontes that fascinates me. \n\u003cbr\u003e Their books, their lives, their spirit. Where did they get it? \n\u003cbr\u003e When I was reading about little Jane\u0027s troubles in the charity\n\u003cbr\u003e school, I got so angry that I had to go out and take a walk. \n\u003cbr\u003e I understood exactly how she felt. Having known Mrs. Lippett,\n\u003cbr\u003e I could see Mr. Brocklehurst.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Don\u0027t be outraged, Daddy. I am not intimating that the John Grier\n\u003cbr\u003e Home was like the Lowood Institute. We had plenty to eat and plenty\n\u003cbr\u003e to wear, sufficient water to wash in, and a furnace in the cellar. \n\u003cbr\u003e But there was one deadly likeness. Our lives were absolutely monotonous\n\u003cbr\u003e and uneventful. Nothing nice ever happened, except ice-cream\n\u003cbr\u003e on Sundays, and even that was regular. In all the eighteen years\n\u003cbr\u003e I was there I only had one adventure--when the woodshed burned. \n\u003cbr\u003e We had to get up in the night and dress so as to be ready in case\n\u003cbr\u003e the house should catch. But it didn\u0027t catch and we went back\n\u003cbr\u003e to bed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Everybody likes a few surprises; it\u0027s a perfectly natural human craving. \n\u003cbr\u003e But I never had one until Mrs. Lippett called me to the office\n\u003cbr\u003e to tell me that Mr. John Smith was going to send me to college. \n\u003cbr\u003e And then she broke the news so gradually that it just barely\n\u003cbr\u003e shocked me.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e You know, Daddy, I think that the most necessary quality for any\n\u003cbr\u003e person to have is imagination. It makes people able to put themselves\n\u003cbr\u003e in other people\u0027s places. It makes them kind and sympathetic\n\u003cbr\u003e and understanding. It ought to be cultivated in children. \n\u003cbr\u003e But the John Grier Home instantly stamped out the slightest flicker\n\u003cbr\u003e that appeared. Duty was the one quality that was encouraged. \n\u003cbr\u003e I don\u0027t think children ought to know the meaning of the word;\n\u003cbr\u003e it\u0027s odious, detestable. They ought to do everything from love.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wait until you see the orphan asylum that I am going to be the\n\u003cbr\u003e head of! It\u0027s my favourite play at night before I go to sleep. \n\u003cbr\u003e I plan it out to the littlest detail--the meals and clothes and\n\u003cbr\u003e study and amusements and punishments; for even my superior orphans\n\u003cbr\u003e are sometimes bad.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But anyway, they are going to be happy. I think that every one,\n\u003cbr\u003e no matter how many troubles he may have when he grows up,\n\u003cbr\u003e ought to have a happy childhood to look back upon. And if I ever\n\u003cbr\u003e have any children of my own, no matter how unhappy I may be,\n\u003cbr\u003e I am not going to let them have any cares until they grow up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e (There goes the chapel bell--I\u0027ll finish this letter sometime).\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thursday\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When I came in from laboratory this afternoon, I found a squirrel\n\u003cbr\u003e sitting on the tea table helping himself to almonds. These are\n\u003cbr\u003e the kind of callers we entertain now that warm weather has come\n\u003cbr\u003e and the windows stay open--\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Saturday morning\n\u003cbr\u003e Perhaps you think, last night being Friday, with no classes today,\n\u003cbr\u003e that I passed a nice quiet, readable evening with the set of Stevenson\n\u003cbr\u003e that I bought with my prize money? But if so, you\u0027ve never attended\n\u003cbr\u003e a girls\u0027 college, Daddy dear. Six friends dropped in to make fudge,\n\u003cbr\u003e and one of them dropped the fudge--while it was still liquid--\n\u003cbr\u003e right in the middle of our best rug. We shall never be able to clean\n\u003cbr\u003e up the mess.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I haven\u0027t mentioned any lessons of late; but we are still having\n\u003cbr\u003e them every day. It\u0027s sort of a relief though, to get away from\n\u003cbr\u003e them and discuss life in the large--rather one-sided discussions\n\u003cbr\u003e that you and I hold, but that\u0027s your own fault. You are welcome\n\u003cbr\u003e to answer back any time you choose.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027ve been writing this letter off and on for three days, and I fear\n\u003cbr\u003e by now vous etes bien bored!\n\u003cbr\u003e Goodbye, nice Mr. Man,\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Daddy-Long-Legs Smith,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e SIR: Having completed the study of argumentation and the science\n\u003cbr\u003e of dividing a thesis into heads, I have decided to adopt the\n\u003cbr\u003e following form for letter-writing.
