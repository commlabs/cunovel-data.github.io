It was as if someone was absolutely hateful. I was afraid. I admit I was afraid. But then Will rushed down, and…nothing. Now, let’s go and see the film.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other three nodded gravely. They walked back into the ballroom and Whitney picked up one of the controls, running back the film to the point where Angela had come down into the basement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw herself walking down the stairs. And then…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was just standing there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t see—” she began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait for it,” Whitney told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a subtle darkening in the room. It didn’t become gray at first, but rather silver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, coming, there was a brilliant flash of light; she could see the lightbulb, and it was evident that the illumination came from the bulb, but if so, it was part of the biggest power surge known to man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again, the film had caught what seemed like dust motes, crystallized and beautiful, floating within the light. And then…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, subtly, but then evident; a shadow seemed to loom up from the ground, twisting into the brilliance of the light, just behind Angela. The shadow seemed to have tentacles or bony fingers that reached out…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching toward her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front door burst open and a fresh breeze of cold air swept through the room. Then, they all screamed and spun around to see that Jackson and Jake had returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill let out a hoarse laugh at himself while the others quickly rose. Jackson, sliding out of his jacket, stared at them all, not as if they had lost their minds, but with a tense expression of concern and displeasure on his strong, bronzed features.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on?” he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We caught some kind of phenomena on camera. In the basement,” Whitney explained quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you didn’t call me?” he queried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhitney flushed. “I called Jake. I didn’t want to alarm anyone or make them rush through anything they were doing, but I thought someone should be aware of what was happening here,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should have called me directly,” Jackson told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhitney looked away uncomfortably. “I thought Jake might have been a bit more discreet. As I said, I didn’t want you all dropping everything to run back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s see what you’ve got,” Jackson said brusquely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill picked up the remote. They all stood, watching the film unfold again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngela looked at Jackson, trying to read his expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Interesting,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Interesting?” Jake exploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJackson looked at them all, one by one, as even and nonplussed as ever. “I’m afraid that a scientist would come in and say that the light was caused by a power surge and that the shadows might have been caused by any number of things. Something in the room falling or adjusting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing fell,” Angela said flatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She was alone!” Whitney protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And there was no breeze in the basement,” Will said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s an old house, on an old foundation, and the basement is foundation,” Jackson said. “Old houses shift. Gravity and physics.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So—so you don’t believe we caught anything?” Whitney said incredulously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJackson smiled at last. “I never said that. I’m telling you what a scientific mind might do with that film.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then?” Will began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m saying that no one goes to the basement alone. I’m saying that there may be some kind of—some kind of something in this house. I think that Angela is our catalyst, and that we need to watch out for her.” He stared at Angela. “And what did you see?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked straight at him. “Light and darkness. Shadows moving. Maybe my mind was playing tricks. They seemed to take the form of people. Something happened, but in truth? I don’t know exactly what.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you’re all right?” he pursued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Absolutely fine,” she assured him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, what do you think?” Jenna asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think that we may well find strange phenomena in this house,” Angela said, looking at him earnestly. “There’s history here. History leads to many things—like skeletons in the ground in the basement. As many times as this house has been redone, I wouldn’t doubt that a psychotic killer like Madden C. Newton might have found a few other hiding places for his victims. There could be more skeletons to be found. Do unusual and unexplainable things happen? Yes. Did a ghost kill Regina Holloway? No. In my experience, spirits remain behind to help the living—not murder them. I think someone human had something to do with that. Does it all combine with the house? Perhaps. That’s why we’re here. We’re investigating. Any other questions?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were all staring at him. It wasn’t with malice. They were eagerly awaiting his answer to Angela’s question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Jackson said. “No questions. We’ve barely brushed the surface here, but we have a great deal more to go on than we did when we got here. First, Senator Holloway, despite his squeaky-clean image and the fact that we believe he did love his wife, was most probably having an affair—one that was well covered up by his staff, if they were aware. A complete cover-up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngela stared back at him, surprised. It seemed he had almost forgotten what had gone on in the house, and what they had caught on film. His sudden turnabout was a little disconcerting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The affair was most probably with his secretary,” Jackson continued. “We know that everyone pretty much hates Martin DuPre, and that Regina Holloway was standing between the chauffeur, Grable Haines, and a loan from the senator to pay his gambling debts—a loan that he has now received. And we know that the bodyguard, Blake Conroy, killed a man when he was young and has a sealed juvenile record. Oh, and it also looks as if the Church of Christ Arisen is one man’s method of acquiring young women as sex slaves. Was that person really Martin DuPre—or was the senator using Martin DuPre to get to young women? One way or another, the people around the senator are involved in the organizations he supposedly hates, and we need to find out how and why—if the senator is aware, or if he isn’t. Personally, I think the Church of Christ Arisen is a slimy cult created for a few men’s benefit, but how it could fit into a murder at this house is something I’m not beginning to see yet, nor do I see the Aryans finding a way to sneak into the house—or for having a motive for murder, but we won’t let them out of it yet, since those are the two main groups against the senator. There we stand. Putting it all together is what we’re here to do. And along that line—” he turned and stared at Angela “—you and I are going to dinner,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry about the rest of us. We’ll just eat sandwiches,” Jenna said lightly. Jackson ignored her. He was still looking at Angela. He had been so matter-of-fact about the real and factual information he had acquired that day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn’t denied them all, but neither had he seemed to take their findings as much that was important. They had something on film. They really had something on film, and she believed that even the most skeptical scientist of all time would have difficulty explaining it all away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Something did happen, Jackson,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew there was more, she thought. He knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe intended to interrogate her, she was certain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dinner?” he asked politely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re the boss,” she reminded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good, we’ll head out fifteen minutes, say? I want to take a run by the museum on Royal Street, too—and see if they have anything on the house. And you,” he said, and turned at last to Jenna. “I think you might want to go out. You and Jake are just about as white as the newly driven snow. I noticed a billboard while we were out today. The Aryans are having a meeting in a rental hall over on Carondelet Street tonight. I think you two should attend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What? Not me?” Whitney teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Apparently, he’s not sending me, either,” Will said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, don’t worry, your assignment will be really exciting,” Jackson teased in return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?” Will said, sounding dubious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re going to go and watch the comings and goings at the Church of Christ Arisen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isn’t that almost like sending us to the Aryans meeting? Can’t wait,” Whitney asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJackson grinned. “Almost, but not quite.” He turned away, obviously intending to head upstairs to his bedroom. He started down the hall to take the middle staircase, but came back. “Keep the cameras running. And remember, no one in the basement alone. And, for that matter, no one in the house alone. All right? Everyone with me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all nodded, and he started back down the hall, whistling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he was gone, Whitney said, “I don’t care what living people might have been involved, there is something in this house.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenna spoke up suddenly. “I know what you saw, Angela. I’ve seen it before. I’ve seen it in the hospital. I’ve seen the light. Somehow, you released a lot of those people. They’ve moved on. That’s what the light was. They’ve moved on to heaven or whatever one might call the phase we reach after we’ve died in this physical life.” She stopped, looking as if she was hesitant about seeing more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’d like a drink,” Will said. “Anyone with me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey headed to the kitchen, Jake joining them. For a minute, they were all silent, except for Will, who was delving into the refrigerator and sorting out who wanted what. Angela was going to ask for iced tea, but she was uneasy about what had happened, and uneasy about going to dinner with Jackson. She opted for a beer, as did the others. She tried to sip it, and drained half the bottle in a single swallow. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/phantom-evil-krewe-of-hunters-1/page-29.html","bookId":2275,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:36:41 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:36:41 PM"}
