What\u0027ll it hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to be good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who says you have to be good?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn\u0027t know being good at tennis has always meant more than being good at tennis. It\u0027s so much deeper than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I look at Caleb, I want to make him proud of me. He\u0027s trying to fix whatever pain he\u0027s caused me. I want to help him, too. \"Okay, I\u0027ll try,\" I say. \"But don\u0027t expect much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifteen minutes later, we\u0027re behind Paradise High looking out across the tennis courts. It brings back memories of me trying to prove myself. Taking a deep breath, I follow Caleb onto the hard, green surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Caleb retrieved my racquet, I froze. I didn\u0027t even want to hold it. So after he fetched his own racquet and some tennis balls from his garage, he carried everything without complaint as we walked to the school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he\u0027s holding out my racquet to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking my hand in his, he wraps my fingers around the racquet handle\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m scared,\" I admit to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raise an eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" he says. \"If you beat me. I have to keep up my tough-guy image, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat makes me laugh. \"You don\u0027t need me to make you look tough, Caleb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, he takes the tennis balls and heads to the opposite side of the court. \"Be easy on me,\" he jokes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hits the ball right to me, nice and slow. Instincts take over and I hit it back. It feels good, I have to admit, but it also feels strange. My body moves differently now, like I\u0027m stiff and can\u0027t loosen up. My legs, my stance, are both awkward and wrong. I can\u0027t balance on the balls of my feet and pivot when the ball comes at me. I can\u0027t lean over in the ready position, ready to strike at the ball when it flies by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Caleb hits the ball back to me, I don\u0027t swing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stands up and shakes his head. \"You could have gotten that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t want to. Can we go now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Hit this back to me ten times, then we\u0027ll go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hits the next ball right at me. I hit it lightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nine,\" he says, counting down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree more balls come within arms length and I gently hit them, so they easily fly over the net right to him. My feet still haven\u0027t moved from this spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Six.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive more gentle balls fly over the net and bounce right in front of me. I send them flying back slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One more, Maggie. Then we\u0027re out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat. Only one more and the humiliation can end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sails one hard and fast over the net. It bounces five feet away from me. I don\u0027t even try to get it. He does it again ... and again. I put my racquet at my side and stare at him. \"Are you trying to humiliate me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop acting like a baby and go for the ball already,\" he says, shaking his head. \"Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow dare he!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, as the ball shoots over the net, my anger and nothing else drives me as I take three steps and whack the ball back at Caleb with all the pent-up power and frustration inside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hits him squarely on his arm. \"Ow!\" I don\u0027t ask him if he\u0027s okay, because he has this arrogant look on his face and the corners of his mouth turn up in victory. \"Did that feel as good to you as it did to me?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI throw the racquet at him and head off the court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won\u0027t give him the satisfaction of knowing it felt exhilarating and awesome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe steps beside me and pulls me to him. \"I\u0027m gonna have a bruise, you know,\" he says. \"But watching you whack that thing was damn hot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look over at the welt growing on his arm. \"It was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a swift motion, he moves forward and pins me against the fence with his body. \"I\u0027m going to kiss you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stomach does a little flip; I forget about being mad. My nerves take over all emotions. \"Here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah. Right here, right now. You gonna run away this time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so, but I\u0027m not sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles, amused at my answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up into his eyes that give me a glimpse into his private world, then lick my lips in anticipation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that is the beginning of our kissing marathon. All I have to say is that I don\u0027t feel inexperienced after an hour of lips and tongues and innocent and not-so-innocent caresses on both sides. I don\u0027t feel insecure about kissing anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe moved from the courts to the park and back to my bedroom. On my bed. Caleb leans back and moans. \"We have to stop this or my body is going to suffer aftershocks for days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelaxing, I lay my head on his chest. \"That was nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, too nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s breathing heavily. We both are. I take a deep, slow breath and bask in the moment. I could stay here forever, just like this. Gazing. Feeling wanted. Feeling protected. Feeling normal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should hate you for making me play tennis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. But you can\u0027t, can you? Besides, we\u0027ve had a makeout session you\u0027ll be thinking about for weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got an ego problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only with you.\" He chuckles, then yawns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I bore you?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all,\" he says, stroking my hair. \"It\u0027s just ... I don\u0027t sleep too well. And I\u0027m so relaxed and content my body is ready to crash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean up on my elbows. \"So sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. My mom won\u0027t be home until late.\" I start to get up, to leave him my whole bed so he could sleep in peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t leave me,\" he says. \"Lie next to me.\" He pulls me down with him. \"You\u0027re so different,\" he says almost to himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t say that,\" I tell him, looking away. I want to keep the false fantasy that I\u0027m the same as other girls, at least for a little while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Different in a good way.\" His brows furrow. \"A really good way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he pulls me tight against him. We\u0027re spooned together as if we\u0027ve been dating for years. We\u0027re even sharing the pillow I\u0027ve slept on since I was ten. The last thing I remember before waking up is Caleb\u0027s slow, rhythmic breathing behind me as he falls into slumber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now I hear the front door open and I\u0027m fully awake. \"Caleb, wake up. My mom\u0027s home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt takes him a second to get his bearings, we\u0027ve been sleeping for over five hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait here and don\u0027t make a sound,\" I say, then kiss him on his sleepy lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSliding out from beneath his arm pinning me to him, I close my bedroom door and head downstairs. \"Hey, Mom,\" I say, my voice groggy from sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t mean to wake you, sweetheart. I hate these late Sunday nights, but I\u0027d rather have them and be able to spend the mornings with you. It seems we spend much too little time together lately.\" She puts down her purse and starts climbing the stairs. I pray she doesn\u0027t want to hang out in my room and have one of those mother/daughter talks. Not now. But I guess if she does, the truth will come out. Maybe it would be a blessing in disguise, but I\u0027d rather not chance it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fine, Mom. You always worry about the small stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn\u0027t hear the creak of my bed behind my door. But I do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom\u0027s eyebrows furrow. \"Why are you sleeping in your clothes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOops. \"I was in my room and must have dozed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m beat, too. Go back to bed. You have school in the morning. And change out of those clothes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Good night.\" I hope she doesn\u0027t realize I\u0027m anticipating with bated breath the moment she closes the door to her room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she closes her bedroom door, I hurry back to my room. Caleb is sitting on my bed, startled. \"I\u0027m so sorry,\" he whispers, still looking as dangerous and cool as ever even half-asleep. \"I lost track of time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walks over to the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caleb, what are you doing?\" I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Finding a way out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hand on his arm and tug on it. \"You\u0027re not jumping out my window. Just wait fifteen minutes and I\u0027ll lead you to the front door. My mom sleeps like the dead and she falls asleep really fast. Besides, if we get caught we\u0027re in this together. Right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt takes him a while to respond. It\u0027s almost as if he doesn\u0027t believe what I just said. \"Yeah. Right,\" he finally murmurs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHIRTY-THREE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI met with Damon this morning, after convincing my parents I stayed out late because I was at Brian\u0027s and we lost track of time. They bought it. Damon came for some sort of evaluation for the State of Illinois. He interviewed my family, even Leah, then we hung out in my room while he grilled me with questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told Damon I asked Maggie to see her leg, leaving out the part that we work together every weekday after school, or the fact that she\u0027s the only person who makes me forget the past year even happened. God forbid I should tell him I slept with her last night, in the literal sense of the word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon shakes his head. \"It\u0027s forbidden to confront your victim, Caleb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t confront her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon crosses my room and puts his hand to his head as if he has a headache. \"You sweet on her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maggie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. No way,\" I lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You small town kids are a breed apart. Okay, here\u0027s the deal: stay away from her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I have a choice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" Damon opens his folder and clicks his pen. \"You\u0027re almost done with your community-service requirements. A gazebo for Mrs. Dorothy Reynolds. I see you\u0027ve been on that job for three weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If all goes well I should be done by the end of next week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon seems impressed. \"Good work, Caleb. You started out rocky, but you\u0027re a decent kid. Let\u0027s meet again next week and talk about what\u0027s going to happen after your release.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m feeling energized after Damon\u0027s visit, knowing the jail threat is almost behind me. I just have to keep the fact that I\u0027m with Maggie a secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knock on my sister\u0027s door. She\u0027s in there. Her room is her cave. My sister hibernates except for school and meals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn\u0027t answer, so I knock louder. \"Leah, open up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\" she says through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh. This is harder than I thought. \"Just open the fucking door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opens it a crack. I push it the rest of the way open and walk inside. It\u0027s too dark in here so I pull the shade up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keep it down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, we have to talk and I can\u0027t see a damn thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too bad,\" I say, my hands crossed in front of my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeah\u0027s gripping the handle of the door, like she\u0027s ready to flee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are Mom and Dad home?\" she asks nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lets out a small breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t even know where to start. I just know I\u0027m ready to say it out loud. It\u0027s been pent up inside of me for over a year. The demon\u0027s got to get loose. Life is not about covering up for crap and living in a fantasy world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a deep breath and tell my sister, \"You hit Maggie with the car and I took the fall for it. It sucked, but it\u0027s over. I wouldn\u0027t have done it if I knew you\u0027d act like a fucking corpse the rest of your life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes are wide as if her brain is registering the truth for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talk, Leah,\" I order. \"Say something ... anything!\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leaving-paradise-leaving-paradise-1/page-23.html","bookId":2771,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:16:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:16:18 PM"}
