A Corrupt Wolf the size of a small cow rushed forwards, bits of carrion flesh hanging from its cruel jaws. Its body reeked of death, and its bright white fangs were exposed and dripping saliva.

The javelin had a tremendous force contained behind it as it shot out, and it had nailed the Corrupt Wolf to the ground. But this was not the end. Just as the Corrupt Wolf fell on the ground, rows of sharp knives immediately stabbed out from underneath, their piercing cold blades stabbing into the Corrupt Wolf’s body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePuff!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Corrupt Wolf was like a dead dog that had been stabbed through the heart with a thousand knives.

She estimated that with her own strength, she could at most pass the third floor and enter into the fourth.

One was to protect her little sister, and the other was for revenge. She had never thought to give up either of these goals.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIf she could cultivate for one year in the Sorcerer Holy Land and reach the Altering Muscle stage, then when she entered the Sorcerer Pagoda, Na Yi had faith that she could enter at least the fifth floor and break through to the Bone Forging stage inside the Sorcerer Pagoda. Then, even if they didn’t have horses, she had some assurance that she would be able to lead her little sister through the wild jungle.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut the major problem she was confronted with now was her lack of food.

She would use herself as bait, and lure a Corrupt Wolf into the Sorcerer Holy Land. Once there, she would utilize the traps within to kill it!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShe knew that if she was to enter the Sorcerer Pagoda and enhance her strength, that it would be much easier to lure the two Corrupt Wolves into the traps. However, Na Yi was not willing to do so. She could not reconcile with the fact that because of these two Corrupt Wolves, she would have to waste her one chance at the smelting trial, the most important opportunity of her life.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShe would make this one gamble!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eCorrupt Wolves were scavengers that usually ate carrion. However, they would also eat living creatures. Na Yi took advantage of the time when one of the wolves went to look for live prey and lured the remaining one it. She would guide it to the traps and kill it!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut her gamble had already half failed from the start. She had underestimated the speed of the Corrupt Wolf, and had been seriously injured due to her own overconfident negligence.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe claw of a Corrupt Wolf was toxic!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA Corrupt Wolf ate carrion year round. Their bodies contained corpse gasses and corpse poison. Once scratched by them, one would be infected by the plague and die afterwards!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNow they were running out of food, and there was also another Corrupt Wolf outside. Having been scratched by a Corrupt Wolf, how could she escape death in this situation?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNa Yi bit her lips and pulled out a dagger strapped to her thigh. She threw it at her little sister and said, “Ah Shui, there are many books in the Holy Land’s Library. Look for some that don’t have much value and gather them here. Create a fire and heat up the dagger. Then, cut out the carrion toxin from my back wound…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHearing Na Yi say this, Na Shui was frightened out of her wits. She looked at the bloody wound on her big sister’s back. How could she do this!?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Big Sister… Big Sister…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Quickly!

She turned around and ran towards the Holy Land Library and gathered some worthless books there. Then, as Na Yi had said, she set that pile of books on fire and used it to heat the dagger.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith the dagger in her hand, Na Shui began to violently tremble. She was a gentle soul; she had never even killed a chicken. Now she must use this knife on her big sister’s back, and this knife was even blazing hot.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Ah Shui, you can do it. I believe in you. If the corpse toxin spreads, then it will be too late!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNa Yi tightly bit down on a piece of cloth, waiting for the harsh pain to come. If it wasn’t for the wound being on her back, then she would never have asked Na Shui to do this.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Na Shui’s eyes flowed with tears, she tore away the clothes on her big sister’s back. There, she could see the wound oozing black blood. Indeed, it was just as Na Yi had said. The wolf’s claws were toxic.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNa Shui found her breath coming out in gasps. She didn’t want to do this, but she had to, otherwise her big sister would die.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eJust as she began to swing her dagger down, Na Shui suddenly heard the sound of footsteps behind her. Startled, she jerked around, her dagger leading the way.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Who is it?” Na Shui was already jittery; even the slightest sound frightened her.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut as she turned around and saw who it was, Na Shui suddenly froze in shock. Behind her stood a ragged young boy. Although he had a pitiable expression, there was a surge of confidence and a calm temperament between his brows.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMo… Mo Lin…\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNa Shui went slack, and then the tears down started falling down. If it wasn’t for the current situation, she would have rushed towards him and cried in joy. “Mo… Big Brother Mo, please, please can you save my big sister? She was poisoned by a scratch from a Corrupt Wolf!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNa Yi also saw Lin Ming, and her heart was filled with an incredible amazement and relief. Mo Lin was still alive!?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHow could this be? In Na Yanda’s records, Na Yanda had only stayed within the Divine Kingdom for a few hours. But Lin Ming had been inside for 7 days and 7 nights!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e7 days and 7 nights… and he had actually returned safely?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming looked at the wound on Na Yi’s back; the blood there was already starting to become a rancid black.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming pressed his hand against Na Yi’s back, and a flux of true essence merged into Na Yi’s body. Lin Ming’s manipulation of true essence had already reached a degree of near perfection. Several thousand filaments of true essence wove into a net that covered the wound.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePuff!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA stream of black ichor began to pour out from Na Yi’s back. In just a few minutes, Lin Ming had already completely forced out all of the toxins within Na Yi’s body.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThen Lin Ming took out a small jade bottle from his spatial ring and sprinkled a handful of powder on Na Yi’s back. This was top-tier quality healing medicine; one tael cost several hundred gold taels.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming gave the small jade jar to Na Shui and said, “Apply this medicine on your big sister.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNa Yi was missing half of her clothes; Lin Ming felt it a little inconvenient to apply the medicine himself.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Oh… okay.” Na Shui whispered before rushing over to help her big sister apply the medicine. As she applied the medicine, she couldn’t help but sneak peeks towards Lin Ming. The way that Lin Ming had forced out the poison from Na Yi’s body a moment ago had left a profoundly deep impression within her young heart.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis scene was even more memorable then when Lin Ming had eliminated the monkey-faced man and the bald man, saving them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eShe thought that Lin Ming was only proficient in his combat prowess.

He wanted to go out and solve the problem of the Corrupt Wolf, but remembering the layers of traps within the Sorcerer Hold Land, he dismissed this idea.
