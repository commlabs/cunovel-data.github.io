Julia is going abroad this summer--\n\u003cbr\u003e it makes the fourth time. No doubt about it, Daddy, goods are not\n\u003cbr\u003e distributed evenly. Sallie, as usual, goes to the Adirondacks. \n\u003cbr\u003e And what do you think I am going to do? You may have three guesses. \n\u003cbr\u003e Lock Willow? Wrong. The Adirondacks with Sallie? Wrong. \n\u003cbr\u003e (I\u0027ll never attempt that again; I was discouraged last year.)\n\u003cbr\u003e Can\u0027t you guess anything else? You\u0027re not very inventive. \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027ll tell you, Daddy, if you\u0027ll promise not to make a lot of objections. \n\u003cbr\u003e I warn your secretary in advance that my mind is made up.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I am going to spend the summer at the seaside with a Mrs. Charles\n\u003cbr\u003e Paterson and tutor her daughter who is to enter college in the autumn. \n\u003cbr\u003e I met her through the McBrides, and she is a very charming woman. \n\u003cbr\u003e I am to give lessons in English and Latin to the younger daughter,\n\u003cbr\u003e too, but I shall have a little time to myself, and I shall be earning\n\u003cbr\u003e fifty dollars a month! Doesn\u0027t that impress you as a perfectly\n\u003cbr\u003e exorbitant amount? She offered it; I should have blushed to ask\n\u003cbr\u003e for more than twenty-five.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I finish at Magnolia (that\u0027s where she lives) the first of September,\n\u003cbr\u003e and shall probably spend the remaining three weeks at Lock Willow--\n\u003cbr\u003e I should like to see the Semples again and all the friendly animals.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e How does my programme strike you, Daddy? \n\u003cbr\u003e I am getting quite independent, you see. \n\u003cbr\u003e You have put me on my feet and I think I can almost walk alone by now.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Princeton commencement and our examinations exactly coincide--\n\u003cbr\u003e which is an awful blow. Sallie and I did so want to get away in time\n\u003cbr\u003e for it, but of course that is utterly impossible.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Goodbye, Daddy. Have a nice summer and come back in the autumn\n\u003cbr\u003e rested and ready for another year of work. (That\u0027s what you ought\n\u003cbr\u003e to be writing to me!) I haven\u0027t any idea what you do in the summer,\n\u003cbr\u003e or how you amuse yourself. I can\u0027t visualize your surroundings. \n\u003cbr\u003e Do you play golf or hunt or ride horseback or just sit in the sun\n\u003cbr\u003e and meditate?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Anyway, whatever it is, have a good time and don\u0027t forget Judy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e 10th June\n\u003cbr\u003e Dear Daddy,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This is the hardest letter I ever wrote, but I have decided\n\u003cbr\u003e what I must do, and there isn\u0027t going to be any turning back. \n\u003cbr\u003e It is very sweet and generous and dear of you to wish to send me\n\u003cbr\u003e to Europe this summer--for the moment I was intoxicated by the idea;\n\u003cbr\u003e but sober second thoughts said no. It would be rather illogical of me\n\u003cbr\u003e to refuse to take your money for college, and then use it instead\n\u003cbr\u003e just for amusement! You mustn\u0027t get me used to too many luxuries. \n\u003cbr\u003e One doesn\u0027t miss what one has never had; but it\u0027s awfully hard\n\u003cbr\u003e going without things after one has commenced thinking they are his--\n\u003cbr\u003e hers (English language needs another pronoun) by natural right. \n\u003cbr\u003e Living with Sallie and Julia is an awful strain on my stoical philosophy. \n\u003cbr\u003e They have both had things from the time they were babies;\n\u003cbr\u003e they accept happiness as a matter of course. The World, they think,\n\u003cbr\u003e owes them everything they want. Maybe the World does--in any case,\n\u003cbr\u003e it seems to acknowledge the debt and pay up. But as for me,\n\u003cbr\u003e it owes me nothing, and distinctly told me so in the beginning. \n\u003cbr\u003e I have no right to borrow on credit, for there will come a time when the\n\u003cbr\u003e World will repudiate my claim.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I seem to be floundering in a sea of metaphor--but I hope you\n\u003cbr\u003e grasp my meaning? Anyway, I have a very strong feeling that the\n\u003cbr\u003e only honest thing for me to do is to teach this summer and begin\n\u003cbr\u003e to support myself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e MAGNOLIA,\n\u003cbr\u003e Four days later\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027d got just that much written, when--what do you think happened? \n\u003cbr\u003e The maid arrived with Master Jervie\u0027s card. He is going abroad\n\u003cbr\u003e too this summer; not with Julia and her family, but entirely by\n\u003cbr\u003e himself I told him that you had invited me to go with a lady who is\n\u003cbr\u003e chaperoning a party of girls. He knows about you, Daddy. That is,\n\u003cbr\u003e he knows that my father and mother are dead, and that a kind gentleman\n\u003cbr\u003e is sending me to college; I simply didn\u0027t have the courage to tell\n\u003cbr\u003e him about the John Grier Home and all the rest. He thinks that you\n\u003cbr\u003e are my guardian and a perfectly legitimate old family friend. \n\u003cbr\u003e I have never told him that I didn\u0027t know you--that would seem\n\u003cbr\u003e too queer!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Anyway, he insisted on my going to Europe. He said that it\n\u003cbr\u003e was a necessary part of my education and that I mustn\u0027t think\n\u003cbr\u003e of refusing. Also, that he would be in Paris at the same time,\n\u003cbr\u003e and that we would run away from the chaperon occasionally\n\u003cbr\u003e and have dinner together at nice, funny, foreign restaurants.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Well, Daddy, it did appeal to me! I almost weakened; if he hadn\u0027t\n\u003cbr\u003e been so dictatorial, maybe I should have entirely weakened. \n\u003cbr\u003e I can be enticed step by step, but I WON\u0027T be forced. He said I\n\u003cbr\u003e was a silly, foolish, irrational, quixotic, idiotic, stubborn child\n\u003cbr\u003e (those are a few of his abusive adjectives; the rest escape me),\n\u003cbr\u003e and that I didn\u0027t know what was good for me; I ought to let older\n\u003cbr\u003e people judge. We almost quarrelled--I am not sure but that we\n\u003cbr\u003e entirely did!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In any case, I packed my trunk fast and came up here. I thought\n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027d better see my bridges in flames behind me before I finished\n\u003cbr\u003e writing to you. They are entirely reduced to ashes now. \n\u003cbr\u003e Here I am at Cliff Top (the name of Mrs. Paterson\u0027s cottage) with my\n\u003cbr\u003e trunk unpacked and Florence (the little one) already struggling\n\u003cbr\u003e with first declension nouns. And it bids fair to be a struggle! \n\u003cbr\u003e She is a most uncommonly spoiled child; I shall have to teach\n\u003cbr\u003e her first how to study--she has never in her life concentrated\n\u003cbr\u003e on anything more difficult than ice-cream soda water.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e We use a quiet corner of the cliffs for a schoolroom--Mrs. Paterson wishes\n\u003cbr\u003e me to keep them out of doors--and I will say that I find it difficult\n\u003cbr\u003e to concentrate with the blue sea before me and ships a-sailing by! \n\u003cbr\u003e And when I think I might be on one, sailing off to foreign lands--\n\u003cbr\u003e but I WON\u0027T let myself think of anything but Latin Grammar.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The prepositions a or ab, absque, coram, cum, de e or ex,\n\u003cbr\u003e prae, pro, sine, tenus, in, subter, sub and super govern the ablative.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So you see, Daddy, I am already plunged into work with my eyes\n\u003cbr\u003e persistently set against temptation. Don\u0027t be cross with me,\n\u003cbr\u003e please, and don\u0027t think that I do not appreciate your kindness,\n\u003cbr\u003e for I do--always--always. The only way I can ever repay you\n\u003cbr\u003e is by turning out a Very Useful Citizen (Are women citizens? \n\u003cbr\u003e I don\u0027t suppose they are.) Anyway, a Very Useful Person. And when you\n\u003cbr\u003e look at me you can say, `I gave that Very Useful Person to the world.\u0027\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That sounds well, doesn\u0027t it, Daddy? But I don\u0027t wish to mislead you. \n\u003cbr\u003e The feeling often comes over me that I am not at all remarkable;\n\u003cbr\u003e it is fun to plan a career, but in all probability I shan\u0027t turn\n\u003cbr\u003e out a bit different from any other ordinary person. I may end by\n\u003cbr\u003e marrying an undertaker and being an inspiration to him in his work.\n\u003cbr\u003e Yours ever,\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59777.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
