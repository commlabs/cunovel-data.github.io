His whole body had begun to grow numb, and his hands were ice cold. It was at that time that he suddenly heard the sound of footsteps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe footsteps were very light, and the person seemed to be walking very slowly. He could feel their every step in his tingling muscles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho was this person?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it Madam Lovesickness, or Tang Qing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoever it was, they certainly would not be bringing good times with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sky was bright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe early morning sun shone in through the door, casting the shadow of the person into the restaurant. It was very long, and it seemed to be in the shape of a woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while, he was able to see the person’s feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shoes were soft and decorated with green flowers. The feet were dainty and delicate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie sighed. He knew who the person was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since when did you start lying on tables this way?” Her voice was general quite pleasant, but now it carried a mocking tone, as acidic as an unripe plum. “Is it because your ass is swollen from being spanked?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie could only laugh bitterly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice continued, “I remember you were always the type to brag until you’re blue in the face.

Aren’t you worried I’ll punch your face until it’s black and blue?”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know you couldn’t bear to,” he smiled. “Don’t forget that I’m your husband.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it turns out, the woman was Hu Yue’er.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crouched down, took hold of his chin, and stared into his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My poor little husband, who was it that beat you up this way? Tell me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re getting ready to go vent your anger on her for me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m getting ready to go thank her.” Hu Yue’er suddenly twisted his nose. “Thank her for teaching you a lesson, you disobedient bastard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. “When a wife wants to curse her husband, she can say anything she wants, but she shouldn’t use the word bastard. After all, it implies bad things about the wife.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bit her lip. “If I really was mad,” she said hatefully, “I could turn you into a cuckold if I wanted to.”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seemed to be getting angrier and angrier.

When people tell me I can’t do something, that’s exactly what I want to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed coldly. “You think you’re so amazing, don’t you?

She couldn’t help but chuckle, and then lightly kiss Liu Changjie’s face. “I knew you were an amazing man,” she said sweetly. “I knew I wouldn’t pick my husband incorrectly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. “It seems like a man does need to live up to expectations,” he said quietly, “otherwise he might really become a cuckold.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunlight shone in through the small window, onto Liu Changjie’s chest.

If you want to eat an egg, you can go there any time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie laughed bitterly. “Sadly, this particular egg is not only picky, it’s also sitting on a wooden plank.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDragon Fifth laughed for the third time, heartily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed he was in a very good mood this day; he had laughed more times than any other day before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Dragon Fifth finished laughing, Liu Changjie slowly said, “I think you forgot to ask me about something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s no need to ask.

It was as if an entire ocean had been placed into a millet seed. The tangible became intangible; within every variation there were countless more variations. Every stab seemed to contain the power to crack gold and stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the eyes of others, this battle might not seem very dangerous, but as he watched, Liu Changjie felt shaken to the core.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQin Huhua really did deserve the title “Best Blade under Heaven.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Dragon Fifth really was an extraordinary talent, the type of person the martial world might not see again in a hundred years.

But, I was acting against my emotions, because I definitely couldn’t let him suspect you.

Even if you beat me harder, it wouldn’t matter. We’re still friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Tianmeng laughed heartily. “Ok. Let’s be friends.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaughing, he extended his hand and gripped Liu Changjie’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then his laughter died. His face distorted. He could hear the sound of bones being shattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this exact moment, Liu Changjie twisted his wrist, breaking it, and then smashed a fist into bridge of his nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t that Lan Tianmeng didn’t see the fist coming, it was that Liu Changjie’s technique was too ingenious, and his speed incredible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter receiving Liu Changjie’s iron-fisted strike, the lion-like old man fell down onto his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie didn’t stop.

When he had beaten Liu Changjie, Liu Changjie had also been unwilling to call out for mercy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though Dragon Fifth’s eyes were still closed, a small smile crept onto his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was not only Lan Tianmeng’s friend, but also his benefactor. And yet Lan Tianmeng had betrayed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForgetting what is right at the sight of profit, biting the hand that feeds you.
