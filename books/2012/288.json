It may be, Lord, that you will have to kill her.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ What? Where is Spinnock?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Returned to your legions. There is war upon the First Shore. The Tiste Liosan seek to invade, and those who oppose them are few.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There are other Tiste Andii?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. ‘No. They are Shake.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShake? The island prison – gods, no . He stood, his desire suddenly torn in two directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Make the Queen yield, Lord,’ said Apsal’ara. ‘Spinnock will lead your people in battle.’ She stepped closer, reached up and brushed Nimander’s cheek. ‘My love, do this.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I will not usurp the Queen of High House Dark! Do we return, only to spill Andiian blood all over again?’ He shook his head in horrified denial. ‘No, I cannot!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then convince her to release Silanah – the Storm will be needed. To save Kharkanas – to save the Shake.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Come with me.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, Nimander. I will go to the First Shore. I will fight. Find me there.’ Her hand slipped behind his head now and drew his face down to her own. She kissed him hard, and then pushed him away, and was past him, out on to the bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thunder of Silanah’s rage was drawing closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNimander rushed inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elders and the young remained camped near the bank of the river, though Spinnock knew that before long they would have to retreat into the city. If Silanah could not be stopped. Glancing back, up the road, it seemed that half the sky was aflame. Forests were burning, the ground itself erupting into fountains of molten rock. He caught a dark shape sailing amidst the smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrawing on his gauntlets, he faced his warriors, and saw that all eyes were upon him. At Spinnock’s back was the forest, and beyond it waited the First Shore. They understood what was to come. He need tell them nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnomander, old friend. Do you now sit at your mother’s side? Do you now look down upon us? Are you helpless, unable to reach across, to still Silanah’s savage fury? Or have you ceased to care?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Anomander, old friend. Do you now sit at your mother’s side? Do you now look down upon us? Are you helpless, unable to reach across, to still Silanah’s savage fury? Or have you ceased to care? ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpinnock straightened, scanned the helmed faces before him. And then he drew his sword. Caught the eye of Captain Irind, gestured the burly man forward. ‘Face to me your shield, Captain, and hold well your stance.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man’s eyes narrowed slightly, and then he took position, raising the shield between them and settling his shoulder beneath its rim, head turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpinnock half turned, as if dismissing Irind, and then he whirled. The sword cracked hard against the shield, staggering the captain. The reverberation echoed, out into the forest, and then fell back like rain among the troops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘When he led you and your ancestors from this place,’ Spinnock said, pitching his voice loud enough to carry – though in truth a sudden silence had taken the scene, and it seemed not even the Storm could reach through, ‘from smoke, from fire, from ruin, Mother Dark had turned away. Before you, before your lord Anomander Rake, there was … nothing .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgain his sword struck. Again Irind staggered but held his ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Prepare to advance. We will not form up once clear of the forest.’ He bared his teeth. ‘There is no time for that. Captain Irind, stay at my side.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpinnock led the way into the ancient wood. Behind him the ranks spilled out, order almost immediately broken by the boles of trees, by sinkholes and tree-falls. The air was heavy with mists. Water streamed down every trunk, every branch, every dark-veined leaf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raised his voice as he advanced, knowing that they would hear him, knowing that Mother Dark had given him this. For her people. For this day, this most fraught day . ‘Lord Nimander has gone to the palace. He seeks to turn Silanah from her path. What value winning the battle if we lose the war? If not for that, he would be here. He would be speaking to you. But he is not. And … this time, this one time , it is well – for like many of you, I was born in this realm.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIrind was beside him, ready for the blow. The sword hammered the shield, the sound a shout of iron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Lord Anomander Rake led you to another world. He fought to give you purpose – a reason to live. And for many, in that he failed. But those of you here – for you, he did not fail .’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-288.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
