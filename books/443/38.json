{"id":12433,"no":38,"title":"Chapter 38","content":"The following day was a hard one on Jack, for he had to pass it in inaction and suspense. He thought it wiser not to venture over to New York: an awkward chance encounter might spoil all. He talked to Mr. Delamare over the \u0027phone, and through him got into communication with the Deputy Commissioner of police. The latter promised him whatever help he needed, which was certainly good-natured, since, at Jack\u0027s invitation, his men had twice assisted in a fiasco.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Kate called him up at the same hour as on the day before.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They\u0027re off for the night again. All four of them.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Anything decisive to-day?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, but many little things have confirmed me in my opinion that Uncle George is our man. He is no less agreeable than at first, but in a curious way I feel his power stealing over us. They have moved to the Madagascar, and have been with us all day. We are already as intimate as possible. Bobo is more friendly to them than their supposed niece. She was in a grinding temper last night after they had gone, and properly threw things about.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To-day, I fancy, Uncle George must have found an opportunity to give her a call, for she was much chastened. It is a strange and welcome sight to see somebody who can tame her. I could almost like this old man if it were not for some things. He\u0027s so sensible! Perhaps that\u0027s why he was successful for so long. A sensible crook must be a novelty.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is,\" said Jack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"To-day they have had all their meals in our rooms. They make me wait on them, because they say I am handier than the men waiters—\u0027and much nicer to look at,\u0027 adds Uncle George.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Confound him!\" muttered Jack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t object to the waiting, of course, for it gives me a chance to hear the table conversation. It is like a comedy. To-day Bobo made a joking reference to the hundred and fifty thousand dollar necklace that Miriam\u0027s heart was set on. The old man just looked at her with those icy blue eyes, and she hung her head. The necklace has not been mentioned since.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Another thing, Uncle George was responsible for firing Chalfonte to-day. Apparently Chalfonte can\u0027t be a member of the gang, but a private friend of Miriam\u0027s. At any rate his doom was sealed from the moment Uncle George turned up. He was insolent at the table in his usual way, and, backed up by Uncle, Bobo fired him on the spot. Miriam couldn\u0027t say a word. Bobo is beginning to think Uncle George is the most wonderful man on earth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"\u0027What do you want a secretary for, anyway,\u0027 Uncle said to Bobo.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Bobo stammered something about knowing nothing about business.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"\u0027Pshaw!\u0027 said Uncle in his hearty way. \u0027If you want any advice come to me!\u0027\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did you get a sample of his handwriting?\" asked Jack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, by great good luck. I didn\u0027t see how I was going to manage it. But he wrote a note in our rooms to-day. I was hoping he might give it to me to post, but he didn\u0027t. However, there was a new blotter on the desk, which took a perfect impression of several lines that he wrote. I have just mailed you the blotter. Hold it up to a mirror. The note you see is just a bit of camouflage. He is enclosing a subscription to the Buffalo Express.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What about their arrangements for to-morrow?\" asked Jack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I can only tell you about lunch. I know that Uncle George and Aunt Sally are coming to lunch in our rooms because I heard Bobo giving a special order over the \u0027phone.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What time?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"One o\u0027clock.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Very well. If the handwriting matches up, you may expect us about that time.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Heavens! How my heart beats when I think of it!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You needn\u0027t be there if you\u0027d rather not.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I wouldn\u0027t miss it for a farm!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good! Then you can give me a signal. When they are all seated at the table, come down to the door of Silas Gyde\u0027s sitting-room and tap three times. On your way back leave the doors open behind you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack possessed three letters in \"Mr. B.\u0027s\" own hand; that which had fallen on the table in the Alpine Heights restaurant; that which he had found pinned to Bobo\u0027s overcoat; and that which had been handed to Mrs. Cleaver in the Hotel Bienvenu. The same hand had likewise kept the card index system. It was a hand of strong individuality, the letters quaintly formed as in antique script, suggesting an orderly, painstaking and somewhat vain character in the writer, who must have gone to no end of trouble to form such a hand in youth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The piece of blotting paper arrived in the first mail next morning. Held up before a mirror, a single glance was sufficient to identify it. There were the same quaint and artistic characters—unmistakable!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack hesitated no longer. He took the first train for Manhattan, and had himself carried to police headquarters in a taxi. To the Deputy Commissioner Jack now told sufficient of his tale to enlist his interest, but withheld the whole, for fear that the official\u0027s natural amazement and incredulity might hold things up. The Deputy was satisfied that the genuine John Farrow Norman stood before him, and that was sufficient. Mr. Delamare vouched for it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack asked for eight men, and they were sent for. In the commissioner\u0027s office he described to them the man he wanted, and gave his offense as blackmail. A capable sergeant was in charge of the squad. They were to proceed to the Madagascar separately. Four of his men he instructed to wait in the street, in case an escape should be attempted from the windows of the state suite. The sergeant and the other three would assemble in Connolly\u0027s room at the hotel and wait until they got word from Jack. Connolly was well known to the sergeant.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Delamare was anxious to be \"in at the death,\" as he put it, but they persuaded him to wait, and appear on the scene a little later.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Shortly before one o\u0027clock Jack approached the Madagascar on foot from the direction of Eighth avenue. He had had himself set down at the corner, because he thought a taxicab might possibly attract attention in the unfrequented side street. He let himself in by the private entrance leading to Silas Gyde\u0027s old rooms. When he was \"fired\" he had taken the precaution of retaining a set of keys.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Here he waited, pacing up and down the little sitting-room watch in hand. The minutes passed with leaden slowness. He reflected on how much had happened since first he had entered that room with beating heart. No detail of the room was changed: the same expensive furnishings which somehow only created a barren effect—even the kerosene lamp and the heater were still there.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Like all imaginative men on the eve of a decisive action, he became a prey to the blackest forebodings. He remembered how often before the old man had fooled him, when he all but had his hand on him. No doubt his infernal luck would still serve him. They would have changed their plans, and gone out to lunch; or some one had tipped him off—he had his spies out; or his sharp eyes had marked the detectives arriving in the lobby.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In the very midst of these depressing fancies Jack heard the agreed signal, three taps on the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A swift reaction passed over him. His spirits soared. \"Kitty has not failed me! Everything is all right!\" he thought.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He called up the office, and asked for Mr. Connolly. Getting him on the wire, he said:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Connolly, have you got four men there, waiting for instructions?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir.\" The house detective had no idea who was speaking.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, just tell them to take their places.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack waited two minutes to give the plainclothes men time to get upstairs. He was thinking: \"After all this time, and all these failures, in a minute I shall be actually face to face with him!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He opened the door into the hotel corridor. Four steps away the door into the end room of the state suite stood ajar. Down the corridor he saw the four detectives taking their places. One was approaching to guard the door by which he entered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack passed quickly and noiselessly through the lower rooms of the suite. In the pocket of his coat he grasped his automatic. He approached the Dutch room through Miriam\u0027s \"boudoir\" since Kate had left the doors open that way. He came upon Kate in this room, standing by a window with her hands pressed tight to her breast to control her agitation. From the Dutch room adjoining came the sound of light talk and laughter.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In passing, Jack touched Kate\u0027s cold hand to reassure her—and opened the door. The cheerful sounds of the luncheon party rushed to meet them. He saw the four at the small table. Bobo was facing him and the bald-headed man was opposite Bobo. Miriam had her back to the windows, and the little old woman faced her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At the opening of the door Miriam turned her head. She was in the act of saying: \"Mary, where have you been?\" when she saw who it really was, and stopped on a gasp. Bobo looked up and saw, too.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"J-Jack!\" he stammered.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With astonishing swiftness the bald-headed man leaped up, knocking his chair over backwards, and, never looking round, ran with head down for the door on the left. This led to the foyer and the main entrance to the suite. The detectives were out there, and Jack let him go. The old lady had covered her face with her hands. Bobo sat like a stone man staring at Jack.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All this happened in a breath. Miriam had sprung up too, and backed away from the table towards the windows. As Jack came further into the room, she suddenly darted behind him into her own room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack was standing listening for sounds from the corridor, when suddenly Kate screamed a warning behind him. He instinctively relaxed, dropping to the floor. There was a shot. The bullet passed about where his head had been, and broke a tankard on the plate rail across the room. From the floor Jack saw the two women struggling for possession of the gun. Springing to Kate\u0027s aid, he disarmed Miriam. She retreated to the farthest corner of the room, panting and snarling like an animal.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The sounds from outside were reassuring. There was a scuffle and the bald-headed man was pushed back into the room by two detectives. He still had his head down, but as he came opposite Jack he suddenly raised it with cool and smiling effrontery. It was Jack\u0027s turn to be dumbfounded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Harmon Evers!\" he cried.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was indeed the philosophic little wig-maker. \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170/61373.html","bookId":443,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 4:41:56 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 4:41:56 AM"}
