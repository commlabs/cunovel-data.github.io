Something was very wrong. “Is that you, Brother Doorkeeper?” he ventured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe figure reached out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMETAPHORICALLY, it said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-and the Patrician handed the sword to Carrot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very well done, young man,” he said. “Captain Vimes, I suggest you give your men the rest of the day off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you, sir,” said Vimes. “Okay, lads. You heard his lordship.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But not you, Captain. We must have a little talk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir?” said Vimes innocently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rank scurried out, giving Vimes sympathetic and sorrowful glances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Patrician walked to the edge of the floor and looked down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Poor Wonse,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir.” Vimes stared at the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I would have preferred him alive, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Misguided, yes, but a useful man. His head could have been of further use to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The rest, of course, we could have thrown away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was a joke, Vimes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The chap never grasped the idea of secret passages, mind you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That young fellow. Carrot, you called him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Keen fellow. Likes it in the Watch?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir. Right at home, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You saved my life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stalked away through the ruined palace, Vimes trailing behind, until he reached the Oblong Office. It was quite tidy. It had escaped most of the devastation with nothing more than a layer of dust. The Patrician sat down, and suddenly it was as if he\u0027d never left. Vimes wondered if he ever had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up a sheaf of papers and brushed the plaster off them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sad,” he said. “Lupine was such a tidy-minded man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Patrician steepled his hands and looked at Vimes over the top of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me give you some advice, Captain,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It may help you make some sense of the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027 \u0027I believe you find life such a problem because you think there are the good people and the bad people,“ said the man. ”You\u0027re wrong, of course. There are, always and only, the bad people, but some of them are on opposite sides. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved his thin hand towards the city and walked over to the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A great rolling sea of evil,” he said, almost pro-prietorially. “Shallower in some places, of course, but deeper, oh, so much deeper in others. But people like you put together little rafts of rules and vaguely good intentions and say, this is the opposite, this will triumph in the end. Amazing!” He slapped Vimes good-naturedly on the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Down there,” he said, “are people who will follow any dragon, worship any god, ignore any iniquity. All out of a kind of humdrum, everyday badness. Not the really high, creative loathesomeness of the great sinners, but a sort of mass-produced darkness of the soul. Sin, you might say, without a trace of originality. They accept evil not because they say yes, but because they don\u0027t say no. I\u0027m sorry if this offends you,\u0027\u0027 he added, patting the captain\u0027s shoulder, ”but you fellows really need us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir?” said Vimes quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes. We\u0027re the only ones who know how to make things work. You see, the only thing the good people are good at is overthrowing the bad people. And you\u0027re good at that, I\u0027ll grant you. But the trouble is that it\u0027s the only thing you\u0027re good at. One day it\u0027s the ringing of the bells and the casting down of the evil tyrant, and the next it\u0027s everyone sitting around complaining that ever since the tyrant was overthrown no-one\u0027s been taking out the trash. Because the bad people know how to plan. It\u0027s part of the specification,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou might say. Every evil tyrant has a plan to rule the world. The good people don\u0027t seem to have the knack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe. But you\u0027re wrong about the rest!” said Vimes. “It\u0027s just because people are afraid, and alone-” He paused. It sounded pretty hollow, even to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. “They\u0027re just people,” he said. “They\u0027re just doing what people do. Sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord Vetinari gave him a friendly smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course, of course,” he said. “You have to believe that, I appreciate. Otherwise you\u0027d go quite mad. Otherwise you\u0027d think you\u0027re standing on a feather-thin bridge over the vaults of Hell. Otherwise existence would be a dark agony and the only hope would be that there is no life after death. I quite understand.” He looked at his desk, and sighed, “And now,” he said, “there is such a lot to do. I\u0027m afraid poor Wonse was a good servant but an inefficient master. So you may go. Have a good night\u0027s sleep. Oh, and do bring your men in tomorrow. The city must show its gratitude.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It must what?” said Vimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Patrician looked at a scroll. Already his voice was back to the distant tones of one who organises and plans and controls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Its gratitude,” he said. “After every triumphant victory there must be heroes. It is essential. Then everyone will know that everything has been done properly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at Vimes over the top of the scroll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s all part of the natural order of things,\u0027\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while he made a few pencil annotations to the paper in front of him and looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I said,” he said, “that you may go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes paused at the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you believe all that, sir?” he said. “About the endless evil and the sheer blackness?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Indeed, indeed,” said the Patrician, turning over the page. “It is the only logical conclusion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you get out of bed every morning, sir?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmm? Yes? What is your point?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027d just like to know why, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, do go away, Vimes. There\u0027s a good fellow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the dark and draughty cave hacked from the heart of the palace the Librarian knuckled across the floor. He clambered over the remains of the sad hoard and looked down at the splayed body of Wonse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he reached down, very gently, and prised The Summoning of Dragons from the stiffening fingers. He blew the dust off it. He brushed it tenderly, as if it was a frightened child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to climb down the heap, and stopped. He bent down again, and carefully pulled another book from among the glittering rubble. It wasn\u0027t one of his, except in the wide sense that all books came under his domain. He turned a few pages carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Keep it,” said Vimes behind him. “Take it away. Put it somewhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orangutan nodded at the captain, and rattled down the heap. He tapped Vimes gently on the kneecap, opened The Summoning of Dragons, leafed through its ravaged pages until he found the one he\u0027d been looking for, and silently passed the book up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes squinted at the crabbed writing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet draggons are notte liken unicornes, I willen. They dwellyth in some Realm defined bye thee Fancie of the Wille and, thus, it myte bee thate whomsoever calleth upon them, and giveth them theyre patheway unto thys worlde, calleth theyre Owne dragon of the Mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYette, I trow, the Pure in Harte maye stille call a Draggon of Power as a Forsefor Goode in thee worlde, and this one nighte the Grate Worke will commense. All hathe been prepared. I hath laboured most mytily to be a Worthie Vessle . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA realm of fancy, Vimes thought. That\u0027s where they went, then. Into our imaginations. And when we call them back we shape them, like squeezing dough into pastry shapes. Only you don\u0027t get gingerbread men, you get what you are. Your own darkness, given shape . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes read it through again, and then looked at the following pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere weren\u0027t many. The rest of the book was a charred mass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes handed it back to the ape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What kind of a man was de Malachite?” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Librarian gave this the consideration due from someone who knew the Dictionary of City Biography by heart. Then he shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Particularly holy?” said Vimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ape shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, noticeably evil, then?-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ape shrugged, and shook his head again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I were you, ” said Vimes, “I\u0027d put that book somewhere very safe. And the book of the Law with it. They\u0027re too bloody dangerous. ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oook.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes stretched. \u0027 \u0027And now,\u0027\u0027 he said, \u0027 \u0027let\u0027s go and have a drink. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oook. ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But just a small one. ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oook.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027 \u0027And you \u0027re paying.\u0027\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eeek. ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes stopped and stared down at the big, mild face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me,” he said. “I\u0027ve always wanted to know . . . is it better, being an ape?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Librarian thought about it. “Oook,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh. Really?” said Vimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the next day. The room was wall-to-wall with civic dignitaries. The Patrician sat on his severe chair, surrounded by the Council. Everyone present was wearing the shiny waxen grins of those bent on good works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady Sybil Ramkin sat off to one side, wearing a few acres of black velvet. The Ramkin family jewels glittered on her fingers, neck and in the black curls of today\u0027s wig. The total effect was striking, like a globe of the heavens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes marched the rank to the centre of the hall and stamped to a halt with his helmet under his arm, as per regulations. He\u0027d been amazed to see that even Nobby had made an effort-the suspicion of shiny metal could be seen here and there on his breastplate. And Colon was wearing an expression of almost constipated importance. Carrot\u0027s armour gleamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColon ripped off a textbook salute for the first time in his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All present and correct, sah!” he barked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very good, Sergeant,” said Vimes coldly. He turned to the Patrician and raised an eyebrow politely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord Vetinari gave a little wave of his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stand easy, or whatever it is you chaps do,” he said. “I\u0027m sure we needn\u0027t wait on ceremony here. What do you say, Captain?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just as you like, sir,” said Vimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, men,” said the Patrician, leaning forward, “we have heard some remarkable accounts of your magnificent efforts in defence of the city ...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes let his mind wander as the golden platitudes floated past. For a while he derived a certain amount of amusement from watching the faces of the Council. A whole sequence of expressions drifted across them as the Patrician spoke. It was, of course, vitally important that there be a ceremony like this. Then the whole thing could be neat and settled. And forgotten. Just another chapter in the long and exciting history of eckcetra, eckcetra. Ankh-Morpork was good at starting new chapters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis trawling gaze fell on Lady Ramkin. She winked. Vimes\u0027s eyes swivelled front again, his expression suddenly as wooden as a plank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“... token of our gratitude,” the Patrician finished, sitting back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes realised that everyone was looking at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pardon?” he said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/guards-guards-discworld-8/page-49.html","bookId":1627,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:54 PM"}
