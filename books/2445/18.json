Because as Mr Crepsley toppled, Steve leant over the railing, eager to watch the vampire hit the stakes and die. As he did, the length of chain he\u0027d used as a weapon - which he still clutched in his right hand - unfurled and dropped beside Mr Crepsley like a rope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrowing out a desperate hand, the vampire grabbed the chain, once again ignoring the pain as spikes buried themselves deep in the flesh of his palm. The chain reached its limit and snapped taut, halting Mr Crepsley\u0027s fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the platform, Steve wailed as the weight of Mr Crepsley caused the chain to tighten around the flesh of his right hand. He tried shaking it loose, but couldn\u0027t. As he stood, leaning half over the rail, struggling with the chain, Mr Crepsley reached up, grabbed the sleeve of Steve\u0027s shirt, and pulled him over further, caring nothing for his own life, intent only on taking Steve\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the pair fell - Steve screaming, Mr Crepsley laughing - Gannen Harst thrust a hand out and caught Steves flailing left hand. The vampaneze groaned painfully as the weight of the two men dragged on the muscles and tendons in his arm, but braced himself against an upright support post and held tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let go!\" Steve screamed, kicking out at Mr Crepsley, trying to knock him off. \"You\u0027ll kill us both!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That is what I mean to do!\" Mr Crepsley roared. He didn\u0027t seem in the least bit bothered by the threat of death. Maybe it was the rush of adrenaline pumping through his veins, having killed the Lord of the Vampaneze - or perhaps he didn\u0027t care about his own life if it meant killing Steve. Either way, he\u0027d accepted his fate and made no attempt to climb Steve\u0027s body to safety. In fact, he started tugging on the chain, trying to break Gannen Harst\u0027s hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop!\" Gannen Harst roared. \"Stop and we\u0027ll let you go!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too late!\" Mr Crepsley howled. \"I swore two things to myself when I came down here. One - I would kill the Lord of the Vampaneze. Two - I would kill Steve Leonard! I am not a man for leaving a job half done, so ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tugged even harder than before. Above him, Gannen Harst gasped and shut his eyes against the pain. \"I can\u0027t - hold on - much longer!\" he moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Larten!\" Vancha shouted. \"Don\u0027t do it! Trade your life for his. We\u0027ll track him down later and finish him off!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By the black blood of Harnon Oan - no!\" Mr Crepsley roared. \"I have him now, so I will kill him. Let that be the end of it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what - about your - allies?\" Gannen Harst shouted, and as the words penetrated Mr Crepsley\u0027s skull, he stopped struggling and gazed up warily at the ex-protector of the Vampaneze Lord.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Asyou hold the life of Steve Leonard in your hands,\" Harst said quickly, \"Ihold the lives of your friends. If you kill Steve, I\u0027ll order their deaths too!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Mr Crepsley said quietly. \"Leonard is a madman. His life must not be spared. Let me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Gannen Harst yelled. \"Spare Steve and I\u0027ll spare the others. That\u0027s the deal. Agree to it, quick, before I lose my grip and the bloodshed continues.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr Crepsley paused thoughtfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His life too!\" I shouted. \"Spare Mr Crepsley, or?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Steve snarled. \"Creepy Crepsley dies. I won\u0027t let him go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be stupid!\" Gannen Harst bellowed. \"You\u0027ll die too if we don\u0027t release him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027ll die,\" Steve sneered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know what you\u0027re saying!\" Harst hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do,\" Steve replied softly. \"I\u0027ll let the others go, but Crepsley dies now, because he said I was evil.\" Steve glared down at the silent Mr Crepsley. \"And if I have to die with him, I will - consequences be damned!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Gannen Harst stared at Steve, mouth agape, Mr Crepsley looked to where Vancha and I were standing. As our eyes locked in grim understanding, Debbie rushed up beside us. \"Darren!\" she shouted. \"We have to save him! We can\u0027t let him die! We?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shhh,\" I whispered, kissing her forehead, holding her close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But?\" she sobbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t do anything,\" I sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Debbie moaned and buried her face in my chest, Mr Crepsley addressed Vancha. \"It seems our paths must part, Sire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye,\" Vancha croaked bitterly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We shared some good times,\" Mr Crepsley said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great times,\" Vancha corrected him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you sing my praises in the Halls of Vampire Mountain when you return, and drink a toast to me, even if it is only a glass of water?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll drink a crate of ale to your name,\" Vancha vowed, \"and sing death songs till my voice cracks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You always did take things to extremes,\" Mr Crepsley laughed. Then his gaze settled on me. \"Darren,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Larten,\" I replied, smiling awkwardly. I felt like crying, but couldn\u0027t. There was an awful emptiness inside of me and my emotions wouldn\u0027t respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry!\" Gannen Harst shouted. \"My grip is slipping. A few more seconds and I\u0027ll?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A few seconds will suffice,\" Mr Crepsley said, not one to be rushed, even when death was beckoning. Smiling sadly at me, he said, \"Do not let hatred rule your life. My death does not need to be avenged. Live as a free vampire, not as a twisted, revenge-driven creature of despair. Do not become like Steve Leonard or R.V. My spirit will not rest easy in Paradise if you do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want me to kill Steve?\" I asked uncertainly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By all means kill him!\" Mr Crepsley boomed. \"But do not devote yourself to the task. Do not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t - hold - any longer!\" Gannen Harst wheezed. He was trembling and sweating from the strain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nor shall you have to,\" Mr Crepsley responded. His eyes passed from me to Vancha and back again, then up to the ceiling. He stared as though he could see through the layers of rock, concrete and earth above to the sky beyond. \"Gods of the vampires!\" he bellowed. \"Even in death, may I be triumphant!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, as the echoes of his final cry reverberated around the walls of the cavern, Mr Crepsley let go of the chain. He hung in the air an impossible moment, almost as though he could fly - then dropped like a stone towards the steel-tipped stakes beneath. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/killers-of-the-dawn-the-saga-of-darren-shan-9/page-18.html","bookId":2445,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:18:45 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:18:45 PM"}
