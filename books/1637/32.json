But as Fortitude and Tranquility rose through a perfectly round hole in the abbey\u0027s floor, they saw the room had only one occupant: the leader of the ascetic priests, the Philologist San\u0027Shyuum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike the cleric that provided Fortitude\u0027s remedies, the Philologist\u0027s humble chair was made of stone not metal. His robes were so tattered they looked like strips of shredded cloth wrapped around his withered frame. The once-white garments were now so dirty they were actually a few shades darker than the Philologist\u0027s ashen flesh. His eyelashes were long and gray, and the wisps of hair on his bowed neck were so long they draped almost to his knees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have not met, I think,\" the ancient San\u0027Shyuum croaked as Fortitude\u0027s and Tranquility\u0027s chairs eased to a stop behind him. He was engrossed in a tattered scroll and did not turn to greet them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Once,\" Fortitude replied. \"But the gathering was large and long ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How rude of me to forget.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all. I am Fortitude, and this is the Vice Minister of Tranquility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe younger San\u0027Shyuum dipped his chair forward in a bow. But, as promised, he did not speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An honor to have met you.\" Rolling the scroll tight in his arthritic hands, the Philologist turned. For a moment he simply stared at his guests with his large and milky eyes. \"What favor do you seek?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Philologist wasn\u0027t feigning ignorance. For secrecy\u0027s sake, Fortitude hadn\u0027t told the priest his purpose, knowing that his Ministerial rank was sufficient to gain an audience. But while the Philologist\u0027s words were cordial, their meaning had been clear: State your business and let\u0027s get on with it. I have much more important work to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortitude was happy to oblige.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Confirmation,\" the Minister said, keying one of his chair\u0027s holo-switches. A wafer of circuitry not much bigger than one of his fingernails poked up beside the switch. \"And a blessing.\" He pulled the wafer free and extended it to the Philologist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two favors then.\" The Philologist smiled, exposing gums split with lines of serrated bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved his stone chair forward and took the wafer. \"This must be very important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortitude managed a friendly grimace. \"One of the Vice Minister\u0027s ships has discovered a reliquary of quite impressive size.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah,\" the Philologist said, squinting one eye to better scrutinize the wafer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if the Luminations are to be believed,\" Fortitude continued, \"an Oracle as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Philologist\u0027s eyes widened. \"An Oracle, you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortitude nodded. \"Truly shocking and wondrous news.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith more speed than the Minister would have guessed, the Philologist rotated his chair and floated to a phalanx of shadowed machinery in the center of the room. As he drew close, holographics flicked on high above, revealing a cluster of onyx obelisks—powerful processing towers linked together—and before these: the Dreadnought\u0027s Oracle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though Fortitude had seen many representations of the holy object, it was smaller than he had expected. Locked inside an armature that kept it head-height above the floor, the Oracle was tethered to the obelisks with strands of neatly plaited wire. These circuits connected to small, golden pads affixed to the Oracle\u0027s casing: a teardrop of silver alloy not much longer than the Minister\u0027s neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe casing\u0027s tapered end faced the obelisks. Its round end angled toward the floor and held a dark glass lens. There was a gap around the lens and the casing, and through this, Fortitude could see pinpoints of light—circuits running at low power. These were the Oracle\u0027s only signs of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is all the data?\" the Philologist asked, slotting the wafer into one of the obelisks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From the ship\u0027s Luminary as well as its sensors.\" Fortitude edged closer to the Oracle. For some reason, he was overwhelmed with a desire to reach up and touch it. As old as the object was, its casing was absolutely smooth—had no dents or scratches. Fortitude gazed deep into the Oracle\u0027s lens. \"There are reports of a new species on the planet that holds the relics, but they appear to be primitives—a tier-four species. I don\u0027t expect they shall—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, the Oracle\u0027s circuits blazed. The lens refracted the light, sending forth a blinding beam. Not a lens. Fortitude gasped. An eye! He raised a sleeve before his face as the Oracle tilted toward him in its armature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026lt; FOR EONS I HAVE WATCHED \u0026gt; The Oracle\u0027s deep voice reverberated inside its casing. Its eye-beam flickered with the cadence of its words as it pronounced in the San\u0027Shyuum tongue. \u0026lt; LISTENED TO YOU MISINTERPRET \u0026gt; Hearing the Oracle speak was, for any faithful member of the Covenant, like listening to the Forerunners\u0027 own voice. Fortitude was appropriately humbled, but not just because the Oracle had finally spoken after Ages of silence. In truth, he was just as surprised to learn that the Philologist was not (as he had always suspected) an utter fraud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortitude had made this appointment for formality\u0027s sake. Luminations presented as evidence before the High Council required the Oracle\u0027s blessing, which for Ages had meant convincing the current Philologist to affirm on its behalf. But these holy hermits were just as political as any other powerful San\u0027Shyuum—equally susceptible to bribes and blackmail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortitude had expected he would have to make some sort of \"donation\" to the Philologist (a small share of the reliquary, perhaps) in order to get the blessing he required.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if the old charlatan is putting me on, Fortitude watched as the Philologist stepped from his chair and dropped feebly to his knees before the Oracle, he\u0027s certainly giving it his all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blessed Herald of the Journey!\" the Philologist wailed, neck low and arms spread wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell us the error of our ways!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Oracle\u0027s eye dimmed. For a moment it looked as though it might resume its long silence. But then it blazed anew, projecting a hologram of the reclamation glyph recorded by Rapid Conversion\u0027s Luminary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026lt; THIS IS NOT RECLAMATION \u0026gt; the Oracle boomed. \u0026lt; THIS IS RECLAIMER \u0026gt; Slowly the glyph turned upside down, and its central shapes—the concentric circles, one low inside the other, connected by a thin line—took on a different aspect. The shapes\u0027 previous arrangement had resembled the pendulum of a clock. Inverted, the glyph now looked like a creature with two curved arms locked above its head. The glyph shrunk in size as the hologram zoomed out to show the entire alien world, covered with thousands of these newly oriented Luminations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026lt; AND THOSE IT REPRESENTS ARE MY MAKERS \u0026gt; Now it was Fortitude\u0027s turn to feel weak in the knees. He grasped the arms of his throne and tried to come to terms with an impossible revelation: each glyph represented a Reclaimer, not a relic, and each Reclaimer was one of the planet\u0027s aliens—which could only mean one thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Forerunners,\" the Minister whispered. \"Some were left behind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Impossible!\" Tranquility spat, no longer able to keep his peace. \"Heresy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From an Oracle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From this meddler!\" Tranquility leveled a finger at the Philologist. \"Who knows what the old fool has done to this divine machinery? The perversions he\u0027s accomplished with all his worms and sacks!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How dare you accuse me,\" gasped the Philologist. \"In this most sacred vault!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Vice Minister drew back in his chair. \"I will do all that and more—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then, the abbey began to shudder. Many decks below, the Dreadnought\u0027s mighty engines sprang to life, shaking free of the limiters that kept them generating the comparatively meager energy High Charity required. Soon the engines would build to full capacity, and then … \"Disconnect the Oracle!\" Fortitude shouted, knuckles white upon his chair. \"Before the Dreadnought launches and destroys the city!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Philologist paid him no heed. \"The sacred vessel breaks its shackles!\" The elderly San\u0027Shyuum\u0027s arms were trembling. He no longer seemed afraid—he seemed inspired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Gods\u0027 will be done!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hologram of the alien world disappeared, and once more the Oracle\u0027s eye shone forth. \u0026lt; I WILL REJECT MY BIAS AND WILL MAKE AMENDS \u0026gt; The vault\u0027s dark walls began to glow as their veinlike pathways brightened inside them. The ancient circuits surged with light that raced into the obelisks behind the Oracle. The banded red and brown rocks began to crack, venting plumes of chalky vapor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, the Vice Minister sprung from his chair, plasma-pistol drawn. \"Shut it off!\" he screamed, leveling his weapon at the Philologist. The pistol\u0027s tip shone brilliant green as it built up an overcharge bolt. \"Or I will burn you where you stand!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut at that moment, the Oracle\u0027s lens became so bright—began to flash with such feverish frequency—that it threatened to blind all three San\u0027Shyuum. Tranquility screamed and brought the long sleeves of his robes up before his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026lt; MY MAKERS ARE MY MASTERS \u0026gt; The Oracle\u0027s teardrop casing rattled inside its armature as if it were trying to take flight with its ship. \u0026lt; I WILL BRING THEM SAFELY TO THE ARK \u0026gt; Suddenly, there was a mighty snap and the abbey plunged into darkness, as if the Dreadnought had blown a fuse. High-pitched squeals echoed around the vault. His eyes filled with stinging tears, Fortitude looked up and saw hundreds of fiery spouts—what looked like extrusions of molten metal—cascading from the walls. As his vision cleared, Fortitude realized these were in fact burning Lekgolo, slithering from the walls. The dying worms plummeted to the floor, where they burst apart in great orange splatters, or curled in writhing crisps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next thing Fortitude knew, the Mgalekgolo bonded pair he\u0027d seen guarding the entrance to the hangar was thundering up the ramp into the abbey, assault cannons fully charged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold your fire!\" Fortitude yelled. But the armored giants continued to stride forward— hunched behind their shield, spines erect and quivering. \"Drop your weapon!\" he shouted at the Vice Minister. \"Do it now, you fool!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill dazed by the Oracle\u0027s light, Tranquility let his pistol clatter to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the Mgalekgolo said something to the Philologist, its voice like grinding stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An accident,\" the aged hermit replied. He looked around sadly at the smoldering corpses of his worms—the ruined remains of his grand investigation—then waved the sentries away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is nothing to be done …\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mgalekgolo held their ground as their colony communed. Then the green light in the bores of their cannons dimmed, and they clanked back to their post. The abbey was dark once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What should we believe?\" Tranquility asked, his voice quiet in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Minister was at a loss for words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could honestly say that he had spent his entire life without experiencing a single moment of spiritual crisis. He had accepted the Forerunners\u0027 existence because their relics were there to find. He believed in the Forerunners\u0027 divination because in all their Ages of searching, the San\u0027Shyuum had found no bones or other remains. He knew the Covenant\u0027s core promise that all would walk The Path and follow in the Forerunners\u0027 footsteps was critical to the union\u0027s stability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he was certain that if anyone learned they might be left behind, the Covenant was doomed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePresently, the holographic shards above the obelisks flickered back to life, filling the room with dim blue light. The blackened Lekgolo looked like etchings in the floor—a macabre and twisted glyph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We must take no chances with these …Reclaimers.\" Fortitude could not bring himself to say \"Forerunners.\" He grabbed his wattle and gave it a steady tug. \"They must be expunged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore anyone else knows of their existence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Vice Minister\u0027s lower lip quavered. \"Are you serious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exterminate them? But what if—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If the Oracle speaks the truth, than all we believe is a lie.\" Fortitude\u0027s voice filled with sudden strength. \"If the masses knew this, they would revolt. And I will not let that come to pass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Vice Minister slowly nodded his assent. \"What about him?\" Tranquility whispered, glancing at the Philologist. The aged hermit was now staring up at the Oracle. The device was slacked in its armature, thin smoke twisting from the gap around its lens. \"Can we trust him to keep this secret?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope so.\" Fortitude released his wattle. \"Or he will make a very poor third Hierarch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSif hadn\u0027t expected any lengthy communications. She knew Mack was trying to keep the locations of their data centers secret. But his responses to her alerts when the alien warship had appeared in-system and then drawn close to Harvest were so clipped and formal, she began to wonder if she\u0027d done something wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat that might be, exactly, Sif had no idea. She\u0027d expertly accomplished her part of the plan—moved hundreds of propulsion pods to coordinates weeks and months ahead of Harvest, along its orbital path. Sif had handled the required high-speed burns herself; getting the pods quickly and accurately into position was critical to the plan\u0027s success, and she hadn\u0027t wanted to leave the maneuvers in the hands of easily flustered NAV computers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer fastidiousness had paid off. The pods were settled well ahead of schedule, two days before the alien warship arrived. This was pure coincidence, Sif knew (neither she nor Mack nor Jilan al-Cygni had had any idea when more aliens might appear). Even so, she couldn\u0027t help thinking the timing was a good omen—a hopeful sign that their complex and unprecedented evacuation would work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when she had delivered the good news about the pods, all Sif got back from Mack\u0027s data center was a terse, anonymous message: \u0026lt;\\ Cease all further COM. \\\u0026gt; Which was fine, she guessed. Mack had explained that after the pods were placed it was critical that she lay low and not do anything to attract the aliens\u0027 attention—give them a reason to do the Tiara harm. So Sif stopped all activity on her strands, and for the first time in her harried existence, she had nothing to do but wrestle with her new emotional inhibition. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-contact-harvest-halo-5/page-32.html","bookId":1637,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:27:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:27:24 PM"}
