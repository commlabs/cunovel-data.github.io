I don’t understand the problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The problem is that she’d like you to refer to her by name, not by her skin color. She’s also not a girl; she’s older than I am. I realize that the phrase used to be appropriate years ago, but—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was trying to be polite!” Kleiman said, and, if anything, looked more rigid and cold. “If you’d like me to say what I really think, I think that…that woman is taking great advantage of you. She’s hardly qualified to run something as complex as a business like this.…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually,” Bryn said, “I’m fairly certain I don’t want to know what you really think, and neither does Lucy. Lucy works for me, not you, and I’m the final judge of her performance in the job, as I am of yours, and it’s your job performance we’re discussing, not Lucy’s. So consider this a warning. If you use inappropriate terms toward any of my staff again, the next time we talk about this will be the last.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is ridiculous! What I said was not in any way offensive!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In your opinion,” Bryn said. “And the point of something being offensive is that it was offensive to someone else. We’re done now. Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a clear dismissal, and Kleiman took it that way. She also slammed the door on the way out, which was damned difficult, since the doors were on hydraulics to make sure they didn’t make a lot of noise. Impressive. Bryn sighed and called Lucy’s desk phone. “Incoming,” she told her. “Kleiman’s on fire. Let me know if she comes after you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She comes for me, she’d better be wearing asbestos,” Lucy said. “Nope, she just passed me by and went to her office.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you have any problems…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come to you, yes, boss. Your four o’clock’s not here yet. I’ll ring you when he comes in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBryn looked at the clock, stretched, and decided she was too restless to sit still for twenty minutes. She stood, put on her white lab coat from the closet, and took the back stairs down to the preparation area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilliam Nguyen looked up as she came through the frosted glass door and gave her a big, warm smile. “Hey,” he said. “Busy day, eh?” He nodded down at the body lying on the table in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was gruesomely damaged, but from the part of the face that hadn’t been mangled, the man was in his fifties, with short-cropped graying hair. There was another body on the second table, covered with a clean white sheet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are these the accident victims?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, it was a nasty one—rear-ended by a drunk driver at a stoplight, pushed their car into a dump truck. The drunk must have been going about a hundred; the car looked like it already went through the cube crusher. This is Mr. Lindell. I’m just doing gross examination right now. I’ll e-mail you the general outline of what it’ll take, but if the son wants open casket, this is going to be a pretty intricate job.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks,” Bryn said. “Just let me know as soon as you can. Hey, William…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah?” He didn’t look up from his close analysis of Mr. Lindell’s cheekbone. “Damn, this is all splintered in here. Gonna be tough to find good anchor material for the reconstruction.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you had any problems with Gertrude Kleiman?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nope,” he said. “Except she won’t talk to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excuse me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never says a word. Even when she comes down here, she hands me paperwork, or picks it up, and leaves. If I say hello, she just ignores me. I don’t know. I just figured she was shy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh,” Bryn said, which was about as neutral as she could make it. “Okay. Thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For what?” He still didn’t take his attention from the dead man in front of him, gently palpating torn tissues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just thanks.” For being cheerfully oblivious, she thought. But the idea that Kleiman was rude to him, too, made her burn. “See you later.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, see ya.” He finger-waved her off, and she went back upstairs, wondering exactly what to do about Gertrude now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t have much time to think it over, because as soon as she’d hung her coat back on the rack in the closet, Lucy paged her to let her know her four o’clock had arrived. Bryn checked herself in the mirror—habit—and went out to greet him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a tall young man, and he looked athletic, but when she spotted him sitting in the chair, he looked…unstrung, like a discarded puppet. He looked up vaguely when she stopped in front of him and said, “Mr. Lindell?” in her gentlest voice. “I’m Bryn Davis. Why don’t we go into my office.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are my mom and dad here?” he asked, still seated. “Can I see them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please, come with me,” she said, and the persuasive, understanding tone worked; it got him up and moving with her. As she shut the door, he looked around her office with blank incomprehension, and she guided him to one of the two small sofas, with the table in the middle. She’d learned her lessons from the old owner, Lincoln Fairview, well; there were tissues in a wooden box on the table, and a trash can tucked discreetly just where a visitor would expect. All her materials were ready—pens, forms, iPad with photographs of options. She sat young Mr. Lindell down, fetched him hot coffee when he indicated he might drink some, and otherwise just listened as he talked for a while. He didn’t, thankfully, return to his request to see his parents; that was something she wanted to avoid at all costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They said at the hospital it was instantaneous,” Mr. Lindell said. “That they never even knew.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt most likely wasn’t true, but Bryn wouldn’t have said so. Not to him, not at a time like this. “I know it was very quick,” she said. “I’m so sorry, Mr. Lindell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Eric,” he corrected softly. “I’m Eric. I want—I want to be sure I do this right, but I don’t know how. I’ve never—I’ve never even been to a funeral before. When my grandfather died, I was a freshman in college, and I couldn’t get back in time for the services.…” He seemed very pale, and much younger than Bryn had initially thought. “What happens now? What do I do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have any other family members who want to be involved?” Bryn asked. She felt sorry for him, for the vacant suffering in his face. He was maybe twenty, she realized—much younger than her, in every way. She’d gone into the army and seen death and brutality; the worst this man had seen might have been a drunken fistfight at a frat party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEric shook his head. “My sister’s off in Thailand on some kind of hiking trip. I can’t even reach her. It’s just me.” He suddenly took in a gasp of air and said, “I need help. I can’t do this. I can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like a cry, and Bryn reached out and took his hand in hers. Instinct. It stilled some of her own pain that still boiled inside. “I know,” she said. “And I’ll help you through this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the best part, she thought, of doing this job—seeing the relief in the eyes of those who sat on this couch, knowing they weren’t going through it alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, she undercharged him for the funeral, because it just…hurt to do anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe work did help, Bryn discovered when Eric Lindell finally left, paperwork in a folder for him to keep. It had been a long session, almost two hours, and the funeral home was quiet when she walked him out to his car. He seemed calmer now, and steadier, and as he was opening the car door, his cell phone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis sister, calling from Thailand. Bryn watched him from the indoor window as he talked, and cried, and finally drove away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, she wanted to be back at the McCallister estate, with Patrick. Life is short. She was reminded of that every single day, here. I need to decide what to do about Kleiman, she thought. It was a thorny sort of administrative case—William hadn’t made a complaint, and Kleiman had taken the reprimand for Lucy’s complaint without too much grandstanding. Hard to dismiss her without incurring some kind of lawsuit, given the facts in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe she’ll quit, Bryn thought. That would be a nice solution for everyone—voluntary departure. And maybe pigs will fly. You don’t ever get off that easily, do you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. No, she didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the work of a moment to pack up the laptop and thumb drive, then another five to check the doors and windows of the building and set the alarm before exiting. She was locking up when her cell phone sounded, and she juggled it along with the keys. “Hello?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bryn? Hi, this is Carl. I was—I was checking in to see when you were planning on having that support group meeting. I’d really like to be there, if possible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrap. She hadn’t thought about the support group at all for days. “I don’t know, Carl. Let me make some calls and see if I can set something up. Have you spoken with your wife yet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I—No. Not yet. Maybe if you would go with me to talk to her—I mean, having someone else there would be good, wouldn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly for Carl. His wife would probably find it intimidating and terrifying, given the situation. But that depended on her, and him. “I’ll call you back,” she promised. “Are you having any other issues right now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t sleep,” he said. “At all. I try, but I just lay there and think. I can’t shut my brain off. It’s like the nanites are making me do it. Did you ever feel like that? That they’re making you do things you don’t want to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was alarming, she thought, and leaned against the pillar. “Like what specifically?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. Turn the car one direction instead of another. Think about—doing bad things.” He sounded positively strange now. “Nobody tested this stuff. They tested it on us. How do we know it’s not changing us, not making us dangerous? Do you know? Does anybody?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/two-weeks-notice-revivalist-2/page-26.html","bookId":2539,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:58:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:58:16 PM"}
