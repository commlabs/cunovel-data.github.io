If she can\u0027t be controlled, it\u0027ll take fire.\" Or maybe she needed to lose her head. I didn\u0027t know. It\u0027s not like I\u0027d raised a bunch of crazy-ass zombies before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe she needed some head-rolling action. Yeah, that\u0027d be mighty permanent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked beyond the royals and saw the rest of the dead, waiting behind them, their eyes trained on me patiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to the Queen, the dead one. \"Restrain the men Gary and Joe Zondorae,\" I commanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flinched, trying to shake off my command even as I gave it and moved toward Clara again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put intent and juice behind it, taking Tiff\u0027s hand in mine, smoothly siphoning off her AFTD. \"Do as I command!\" I yelled into the absorbent atmosphere of the sphere, my force of will thrown in her direction like a sucker punch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bowed over at the waist, hissing as if in pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStraightening, she began to move toward Clara and the female warrior of the Band.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy said, \"She\u0027s gonna need the torch, dude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah... or something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there was the Prince, my eyes shifting to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about him?\" I said to the general crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He makes Ada look tame,\" Daniel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe female warrior of the Band with eyes like pale violet, stepped forward. Raising her dagger, she wielded it with graceful speed, smoothly moving beside the corpse of Queen Ada, taking off her arm in a sliding pull. The limb jerked out of the shoulder with a sickening pop that echoed in the stillness of the tunnel. The bystanders were silent, watching the dead fill the tight confines of the tunnel, the air burdened with the fragrance of their decomposition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral people started coughing with what I liked to think of as the pre-barf gag. Pretty soon it wouldn\u0027t be pre anymore. It\u0027d be happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027d keep \u0027em busy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe female warrior raised her blade again to take the next piece of the zombie queen off while I turned my attention to the sane zombies and saw the Prince casually backhand her before her blade connected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flew backwards, knocking her head against the wall of the interior of the sphere and slid down, dazed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe leader of the Band growled deep in his throat and rushed Prince Frederic, his powerful muscles bunching and contracting as he plowed toward his intended target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex piped in from a couple of meters away, \"They\u0027re strong!\" he hollered in warning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe male of the Band never hesitated; charging, he lowered his head like a mighty bull and surged toward the Prince, lifting him bodily as he made contact. The royal zombie grabbed the huge man and swung him around, releasing him as he used the momentum of the leader\u0027s charge against him. The crown that\u0027d been on the Prince\u0027s head went spinning off onto the dirt floor, rolling until it hit the feet of the zombie horde that had poured through the massive door. The ginormous body of the leader of the Band was hurtled in the same direction where the female lay, equally stunned. The leader trained his eyes on the remainder of the Band.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZombie Prince shifted his gaze to Queen Clara. Madness flowed in the depths of his eyes like pond scum. I watched him come, much faster than the Queen had, who was working her way toward Clara at this very moment, minus a limb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was out-of-balance but tenacious as hell. Like all zombies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were a motivated group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard Clara whimper, the soft sound of terror seemingly igniting a match underneath the warrior who never left her side. As soon as he heard it he treated the zombie like three of the fragment instead of the one dead man it was, having seen the example of his Bandmate thrown like a toy. I watched him approach my out-of-control zombie with caution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved in, his directive to protect the living queen in the face of anything never changing. Never faltering. I saw it on his face like a promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst things which lived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr those that had died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had all I could do to contain the remaining dead. Taking the crazy zombies into account, I had to guess about who was bad... and who was good. I\u0027d start with the science sib squad. Those two needed to be subdued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot a lot of deliberation needed for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDefinitely in the bad tally side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flung that directive to a group of five corpses that had followed behind the royal wackos and they moved toward the Zondorae brothers like a wave of controlled menace, their smell preceding them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was used to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey weren\u0027t. The brothers began gagging even as they were pegging the zombies with their useless pulse guns, covering their mouths with the other hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonesy chortled. \"Hey guys, those aren\u0027t gonna work... I\u0027m just saying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was too busy coordinating my directives to notice Jonesy\u0027s excellent command of sarcasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough it was much appreciated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched as the big guy, Matthew, started hacking at the Prince. He was taking chunks out of the guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was all for it, I couldn\u0027t control crazy, apparently. I didn\u0027t have the heart to tell him it wouldn\u0027t do much good. He\u0027d keep coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZombie resilience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree of the Band came from behind to help but the remaining dead were clumsy. They stumbled through the Band and the assembled crowd of losers from the other sphere and pushed people aside like bowling pins. After all, they were just following orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSubdue the crowd was about as simple a command as I\u0027d ever given. But they were not a thinking bunch, stumbling around on the way to their goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSingle-minded dudes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it had allowed a hole to open between where the corpses struggled into the three of the Band trying to aid Clara and opened just wide enough a gap for the dead Prince to latch onto Queen Clara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClara screamed as the dead hand of the Prince clamped onto her shoulder. I knew from experience it would be fierce and immobile. I could see her sway with the crushing pain of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved forward just as Matthew of the Band reached her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed my zombie reflexively. \"Release her!\" I bellowed into its rotting face, the zombie inches taller than I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt paused, meeting my eyes, the obsidian stare without light. \"No, Master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the longsword that was free of its binding took his head off at the base of the neck in a practiced swipe, so quickly executed, I felt the breeze at its passing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQueen Clara was released from the vise grip of the dead Prince forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not know it, her consciousness slipping away even as Matthew bent to catch her against him, his long sword tip stabbed into the earth of the tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked ready for anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter what.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter how many.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 12\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched the Band turn their attention to the angry mob that had filtered through the tunnel where they stood, all but Matthew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had eyes only for the dead Queen, minus an arm, ready to snatch the unconscious Clara out of his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade rushed to his side. \"I\u0027ll hold her while you...\" she couldn\u0027t finish it. I knew Jade saw what his intent was. Death Intent. He wore it like a coat of armor, he\u0027d killed before. I could see it as he walked toward the dead Queen. She knew it too, hissing at him as he made his way to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe never broke stride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at Jade and she met my stare. I could feel what she felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade could feel the Evil. The Queen had been evil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvil in life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvil in death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let him go about his business and turned my attention to the other big ass problem on the list. There were so many I was getting distracted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found the Zondorae brothers easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMewling within the circle of the dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled and strode to where they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Zondorae brothers were covered in their own puke. It probably almost masked the scent of the newly dead that surrounded them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMostly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was raw corpse or vomit... but the puke was closer to their noses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi guys!\" I said almost cheerfully. My sympathy, zero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey scowled. I watched their expressions ask if it could be any worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProbably not. Although, they could be dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled and their expressions went from fear to anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yeah, it\u0027s gonna get exciting for you chumps,\" I said in a conversational tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe corpses tightened their hold, reacting to my state of mind like a ripple in the water going out, out... and endlessly on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne gave a long lick of Gary\u0027s ear, the smell of the decaying tongue causing the scream he had held in check to escape his mouth in a wail that pierced the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the catalyst for the panic which began to sweep the tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped when I saw the crowd swell and surge everywhere as my eyes sought Jade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re safe,\" I saw Jade say and relaxed only to tense again as the mob flowed toward us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched Jade and Queen Clara notice Matthew doing the hack-a-thon on the dead Queen, her rotting flesh flinging itself like gruesome and bloodless rain around us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dead did not bleed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart clenched in my chest when the small Queen slid a dirk out of the strange boy\u0027s clothing she wore and headed toward the dead Queen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t have to be a brain surgeon to figure out her goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d never meet it. The dead were stronger than the living.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWanting to end them wasn\u0027t enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jogged to meet her, grabbing Jade as I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dead Queen laughed out of a mouth with loosened teeth as Clara\u0027s protector took pieces of her flesh with his small knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew she didn\u0027t feel pain, she staggered toward Clara, ignoring his assault. Instead, she focused on Clara, hatred a mask on her face. Even in death, it was a window to who she\u0027d been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQueen Ada smiled with purpose, she knew Clara, reaching for her just as Matthew looked behind him and saw the woman he protected approach the dead Queen who would not stop until she harmed Clara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote for future: insane zombies were intent on one thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy the dead Queen wanted to kill Queen Clara was a mystery but I wasn\u0027t going to let the zombie I\u0027d raised kill the ones that we\u0027d come to save.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClara and her people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew moved to swing and was caught in the mob as they pushed forward, the bellowing scream from the Zondorae retard igniting the flame of their panic instantly. Matthew was shoved to the side with three of his Bandmates and swept aside as a river of people flowed between him and Clara.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dead Queen wrapped her hand in the deep red of Clara\u0027s hair and torqued her head back, close enough to kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Matthew yelled, his terror at the zombie\u0027s nearness and the strength for harm she possessed caused even the crowd to pause at the tone in his bellowed alert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold them,\" I told the zombies that had the Zondorae brothers prisoner. Their rotting arms were surer than the tightest bindings, as I made them babysit the asshats that started all this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQueen Ada hissed in Clara\u0027s face, \"I will be Queen. Not your whore of a mother or her simpleton spawn,\" she ground out, a tooth dropping out of her mouth, rolling down the front of Clara\u0027s tunic to fall at their feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes followed that decaying tooth and I snapped my head up at attention. Wow, family drama big time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo guys that were dressed like the mob but didn\u0027t look like the derelict spawn roaming around, approached the zombie Queen from behind. I opened my mouth to warn them but Clara took care of it by bringing up her arm in a twisting lunge and severed the one arm the dead queen had, the dead flesh giving way to the sharpness of the metal, the hand which gripped Clara\u0027s hair, shaken off and falling to the ground to join the tooth that lay there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would\u0027ve been funny in different circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDead parts scattered all around. It made no difference. The zombie Queen... kept coming anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAda lunged her head forward into Clara\u0027s, using her head as weapon. Clara stumbled back into the people behind her as the corpse that\u0027d apparently been her mother rode her to the ground, her remaining teeth in full reveal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth open to chew and maim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClara her target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the little Queen used the crowd behind her like a trampoline and sprang forward, leaping onto the zombie, who toppled under her momentum. Ada lost her balance, without one arm and only the stump of the other, she was unable to right herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dead Queen lurched her neck forward like a bird looking for a worm from its parent, trying to sink her teeth into Clara\u0027s hand that was near her face. Clara slapped the Queen\u0027s face and I watched as the flesh flew away with a wet splatter on the dirt of the tunnel floor. My zombie sat up underneath Clara\u0027s straddle and went toward her neck to tear out the fragile artery that beat there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI met Matthew as he pushed the crowd away and we reached for Clara at the same moment. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/death-weeps-death-5/page-17.html","bookId":2493,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:07 PM"}
