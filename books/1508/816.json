Faint traces of flames flickered from its body, burning away all of the black fog that dared to encroach upon it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe Cosmic Melting Furnace was a quasi-Saint artifact, and was an astounding defensive treasure. Although it could only play a limited role when used against living, thinking enemies, it was actually the best lifesaving card in this situation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Lin Ming, I know what this is….” Within Lin Ming’s spiritual sea, Demonshine’s echoed out.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The Eternal Demon Abyss truly is greatly related to the Sea of Miracles.

As he looked through the Demon Emperor’s memories about this ‘sea serpent’, he recalled that it was an ancient vicious beast similar to the great pythons and flood dragons. It lived in the sea, absorbing the essence of the sun and moon, constantly releasing fog.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMortals would call the light that refracted off of the surface of the sea a ‘sea serpent mirage’.

However, because different regions had different perspectives on things, the truth was that a Saint Beast was only a very general concept. The difference between a powerful Saint Beast and a weak Saint Beast was like the difference between the clouds and the earth below them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, now was not the time to be awed by these matters.

Both of them are areas closed off by a force field, and the inside and outside could be considered as separate world. Even if Situ Bonan were to catch up, he still wouldn’t be able to sense you from outside of the 8000 Mile Black Swamp.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“You might as well take this time to refine some of this sea serpent gas.

If even we have so much trouble withstanding to this point, then it’s already a miracle that he could last up to this point.” Bi Ruyu’s were gloomy as she found this fact hard to reconcile with. “Humph, it’s already benefitting him.

The third and fourth Demon Envoy coughed up blood at the same time, their faces pale and yellow.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBi Ruyu found herself short of breath.

Every single smash of energy made their barrier of energy tremble like a flickering candle in the wind. Bi Ruyu’s expression changed. Just what was this black fog?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003ePeng!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAll of the blood vessels on the third Demon Envoy’s right hand suddenly ruptured. The protective true essence barrier in that area suddenly lost part of its support, a crack appearing on its surface.

Not caring about how much true essence she lost, she raised her skinny claw-like hands and pounded her withered chest. It was only after forcefully spitting out her blood essence on the barrier of energy did she manage to forcefully stabilize it. As for that black fog that seeped within the barrier, it was cleared away by her blood essence.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“I’ve consumed 70% of my true essence!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe second Demon Envoy’s forehead was thick with beads of sweat. The third and fourth Demon Envoys had obviously reached their limit. Particularly the third Demon Envoy, as his arm had become nothing but bones, and he had nearly fallen unconscious.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Take out your blood essence!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBi Ruyu crazily said. At this time, she could not care about losing blood essence.

This sea serpent gas was so strong that it was even able to somewhat hollow out the flame walls.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever, the Cosmic Melting Furnace was extremely tough, and had a high regenerative capability. Even the depressed flame walls quickly restored themselves to their previous state.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis sort of situation only occurred because Lin Ming’s cultivation was too low, and he wasn’t able to pour in enough true essence into the Cosmic Melting Furnace. Otherwise, if a true powerhouse were to control a quasi-Saint artifact ranked treasure, then this certainly wouldn’t have happened.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt this time, Lin Ming was completely dependent on the Cosmic Melting Furnace to resist this sea serpent gas.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“This is only a sea serpent dragon from the very edge of the Sea of Miracles, and yet the gas that it unintentionally spewed out is already enough to make me suffer to this degree. Just what sort of scene will play out deep within the Sea of Miracles?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming sighed with emotion. It was highly likely that there existed a God Beast within both the Sea of Miracles and the Eternal Demon Abyss. A God Beast was in itself an incomparably rare and unimaginable existence in the Realm of the Gods, so why would they appear on such insignificant lands like the Sky Spill Continent and the Holy Demon Continent?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThere was also the fact that the Great Emperor’s heart had never stopped beating for over 100,000 years, which was truly shocking.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming shook his head, no longer bothering with such distant matters. He carefully allowed some sea serpent gas to enter in. He began refine it according to Demonshine’s method until only three shiny black crystals were left. These were sea serpent crystals.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn this time, the black fog energy that had previously attacked \u0026nbsp;the Cosmic Melting Furnace without pause began to weaken. The sea serpent gas had finally begun to disperse.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e……….\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“We’ve finally….made it through!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe sea serpent gas left just as quickly as it came. From the point that the sea serpent gas began to fade away, it only took several breaths of time before completely disappearing.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBi Ruyu’s entire body was soaked with sweat. She had continuously overdrawn her true essence, causing herself to rapidly age. By her side, the second Demon Envoy was also in dire straits. He had spat out blood essence twice, causing his mind to fall to an anguished state, and his face to become jaundiced.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe one worst off was the third Demon Envoy. He had lost his right hand and was already unconscious.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBi Ruyu looked up to the sky and saw that the dark clouds floating up there were even heavier, as if they had become much richer with much more thunder light flashing within them. According to the time that passed, it should have been approximately dawn at this time. However, the 8000 Mile Black Swamp didn’t have the least bit of sunlight. If it weren’t for the intermittent lightning flashing in the skies, then she wouldn’t have been able to see even her own fingers in front of her.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn such a place, even the fires of one’s life were suppressed.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Damn this place!” Bi Ruyu became ugly to the extreme. She originally had 400-500 years of life left, but after being tossed about today, she feared that she could only live for 300 more.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBut, if she could bring back the Demon Emperor Armor and the Demon Emperor’s inheritance, then she should be able to obtain a life extending pill that was even more precious than the Life Bestowing Heaven Pill. At that time, she would be able to instantly make up for all her losses.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs Bi Ruyu thought this she said, “I’m guessing that there aren\u0027t even ashes of that brat left over. We shall take the Demon Emperor Armor back. That is a holy relic, and shouldn’t have been melted by the black fog. I don’t know if that ‘Great Desolate Halberd Art’ jade slip is on that brat’s body, but the jade slip that such a cultivation method is engraved on should be an extraordinary treasure. It should still be in good condition if it’s there.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBi Ruyu swallowed a true essence recovery pill. The second Demon Envoy also swallowed down some pills and grabbed the third Demon Envoy. With the fourth Demon Envoy, all of them shot towards the last location of the tracing mark.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThey were already very close to Lin Ming. At this time, the fog had also dissipated a bit, and they could make out 7-8 miles in front of them. At the very end of their vision, they could see the black-clothed Lin Ming floating in air, perfectly fine. Beside him, a small golden furnace was gently rotating in midair.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eFor a while, they were stunned, shocked, aghast, horrified, and all sorts of other emotions that quickly flashed across their faces.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eLin Ming was in front of them, without even a single wound on his body! Not only had he not used up any true essence, he even seemed to have nearly restored himself to the peak condition from when they had just started chasing him!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eJust what was going on here!?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the four people saw Lin Ming, Lin Ming also saw them. He instantly put away the Cosmic Melting Furnace that was still refining the sea serpent gas. At such a far distance, and with such a quick glimpse, Lin Ming wasn’t worried that they would recognize just what rank of treasure the Cosmic Melting Furnace was.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“So you fellows are alive….the top 100 ranked Destiny Decree masters truly have extraordinary strength.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn the sea serpent gas, even the Cosmic Melting Furnace had developed a few holes in its defenses. Yet, these people were able to live through it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Get him!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBi Ruyu gravely cried out. At this time, she couldn’t wonder about why Lin Ming hadn’t died. What mattered was capturing him!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIt was possible that Lin Ming had some sort of protective treasure on him that far exceeded their imaginations. It seemed as if there were endless valuable treasures on his body. This only caused Bi Ruyu to want to capture Lin Ming alive even more, so she could torture all the secrets out of him.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eNetherworld Bone Claws!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBi Ruyu gave a loud shout and stretched her claws out at Lin Ming, her energy gathering to the limit. A deep purple light burst out from her entire body as a ghostly phantom appeared above her withered right hand.
