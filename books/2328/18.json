And there\u0027ll probably be more tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was one call Thursday, and it had seemed promising early on. A woman in her early thirties taking graduate courses at St. John\u0027s University, abducted at knifepoint by three men as she was unlocking her parked car in one of the campus parking lots. They piled into the car with her and drove to Cunningham Park, where they had oral and vaginal sex with her, menaced her throughout with one or more knives, threatened various forms of mutilation, and did in fact cut her on one arm, although the wound may have been inflicted accidentally. When they were done with her they left her there and escaped in her car, which had still not been recovered almost seven months after the incident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it can\u0027t be them,\" Elaine said, \"because the guys were black. The ones on Atlantic Avenue were white, weren\u0027t they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, that\u0027s one thing everybody agrees on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, these men were black. I kept, you know, returning to that point, and she must have thought I was racist or something, or that I suspected her of being a racist, or I don\u0027t know what. Because why should I keep pounding away at the color of the rapists? But of course it was all-important from my point of view, because it means that she\u0027s out of the picture for our purposes. Unless sometime between now and last August they figured out how to change color.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If they worked that out,\" I said, \"it\u0027d be worth a lot more than four hundred thousand to them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice. Anyway, I felt like an idiot, but I took her name and number and said we\u0027d call her if we got a green light on the project. You want to hear something funny? She said whether it leads to anything or not she\u0027s glad she called, because it did her good to talk about it. She talked about it a lot right after it happened and she had some counseling but she hasn\u0027t talked about it lately, and it helped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That must have made you feel good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It did, because up to then I\u0027d been feeling guilty for putting her through it under false pretenses. She said I was very easy to talk to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that comes as no surprise to this reporter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She thought I was a counselor. I think she was leading up to asking if she could come in once a week for therapy. I told her I was an assistant to a producer, and that you needed pretty much the same skills.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHAT same day, I finally managed to get hold of Detective John Kelly of Brooklyn Homicide. He remembered that Leila Alvarez case and said it was a terrible thing. She\u0027d been a pretty girl and, according to everyone who knew her, a nice kid and a serious student.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said I was doing a piece on bodies abandoned in unusual locations, and I asked if there had been anything unusual about the condition of the body when it was found. He said there\u0027d been some mutilation and I asked if he could give me a little more detail and he said he thought he\u0027d better not. Partly because they were keeping certain aspects of the case confidential, and partly to spare the feelings of the girl\u0027s family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you can understand,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried a couple of other approaches and kept running up against the same wall. I thanked him and I was going to hang up, but something made me ask him if he\u0027d ever worked out of the Seven-eight. He asked why I wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I knew a John Kelly who did,\" I said, \"except I don\u0027t see how you could be the same man, because he would have to be well past retirement age by now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was my dad,\" he said. \"You say your name\u0027s Scudder? What were you, a reporter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I was on the job myself. I was at the Seven-eight for a while, and then I was at the Six in Manhattan when I made detective.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you made detective? And now you\u0027re a writer? My dad talked about writing a book, but that\u0027s all it ever was, talk. He retired, oh, it must be eight years now, he\u0027s down in Florida growing grapefruit in his backyard. Lot of cops I know are working on a book, or say they are. Or say they\u0027re thinking about it, but you\u0027re actually doing it, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time to shift gears. \"No,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg your pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was crap,\" I admitted. \"I\u0027m working private, it\u0027s what I\u0027ve been doing since I left the department.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what do you want to know about Alvarez?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to know the nature of the mutilation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to know if it involved amputation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause, long enough for me to regret the whole line of questioning. Then he said, \"You know what I want to know, mister? I want to know just where the fuck you\u0027re coming from.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was a case in Queens a little over a year ago,\" I said. \"Three men took a woman off Jamaica Avenue in Woodhaven and left her on a golf course in Forest Park. Along with a lot of other brutality, they cut off two of her fingers and stuck them in, uh, bodily openings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got a reason to think it was the same people did both women?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but I have reason to believe that whoever did Gotteskind didn\u0027t stop at one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was her name in Queens? Gotteskind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Marie Gotteskind, yes. I\u0027ve been trying to match her killers to other cases, and Alvarez looked possible, but all I know about it is what wound up in the papers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alvarez had a finger up her ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same with Gotteskind. She also had one in front.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In her-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re like me, you don\u0027t like to use the words when it\u0027s a dead person. I don\u0027t know, you hang around the MEs, they\u0027re the most irreverent bastards on earth. I guess it\u0027s to insulate themselves from feeling it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it seems disrespectful to me. These poor people, what else can they hope for but a little respect after they\u0027re dead? They didn\u0027t get any from the person who took their life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She had a breast missing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg your pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alvarez. They cut off a breast. From the bleeding, they say she was alive when it happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dear God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to get these fucks, you know? Working Homicide you want to get everybody because there\u0027s no such thing as a little murder, but some of them get to you and this was one that got to me. We really worked it, we checked her movements, we talked to everybody who knew her, but you know how it is. When there\u0027s no connection between the victim and the killer and not much in the way of physical evidence, you can only take it so far. There was very little on-scene evidence because they did her somewhere else, then dumped her in the cemetery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was in the paper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same thing with Gotteskind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I\u0027d known about Gotteskind- you say over a year ago?\" I gave him the date. \"So it\u0027s been sitting in a file in Queens and how am I supposed to know about it? Two corpses with fingers, uh, removed and reinserted, and here I am with my thumb up my ass, and I didn\u0027t mean to say that. Jesus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope it helps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You hope it helps. What else have you got?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re holding out-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All I know about Gotteskind is what\u0027s in her file. And all I know about Alvarez is what you just told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what\u0027s your connection? Your own personal connection?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just told you I-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no, no. Why the interest?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s confidential.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hell it is. You got no right to hold out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what do you call it, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a breath. I said, \"I think I\u0027ve said as much as I have to. I have no special knowledge of either homicide, Gotteskind or Alvarez. I read the one\u0027s file and you told me about the other and that\u0027s the extent of my knowledge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What made you read the file in the first place?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A newspaper story a year ago, and I called you on the basis of another newspaper story. That\u0027s it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got some client you\u0027re covering for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I\u0027ve got a client, he\u0027s certainly not for perpetrator, and I can\u0027t see how he\u0027s anything but my own business. Wouldn\u0027t you rather compare the two cases yourself and see if that gives you a wedge into them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, of course I\u0027m gonna do that, but I wish I knew your angle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could tell you to come in. Or have you picked up, if you\u0027d rather play it that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could,\" I agreed. \"But you wouldn\u0027t get a damn thing more than I already told you. You could cost me some time, but you\u0027d be wasting time of your own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got your fucking nerve, I\u0027ll say that for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, come on,\" I said. \"You\u0027ve got something now that you didn\u0027t before I called. If you want to cop a resentment I suppose you can hang on to one, but what\u0027s the point?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What am I supposed to say, thank you?\" It wouldn\u0027t hurt, I thought, but kept the thought to myself. \"The hell with it,\" he said. \"But I think you\u0027d better let me have your address and phone, just in case I need to get in touch with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mistake had been in letting him have my name. I could find out if he was enough of a detective to look me up in the Manhattan book, but why? I gave him my address and phone and told him I was sorry I wasn\u0027t able to answer all his questions, but I had certain responsibilities to a client of mine. \"That would have pissed me off when I was on the job,\" I said, \"so I can understand why it would have the same effect on you. But I have to do what I have to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, that\u0027s a line I\u0027ve heard before. Well, maybe it\u0027s the same people in both cases, and maybe something\u0027ll break if we put \u0027em side by side. That\u0027d be nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was as close to \"thank you\" as we were going to get, and I was happy to settle for it. I said it would be very nice, and wished him luck. I asked to be remembered to his father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 10\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night I went to a meeting and Elaine attended her class, and afterward we both took cabs and met at Mother Goose and listened to the music. Danny Boy turned up around eleven-thirty and joined us. He had a girl with him, very tall, very thin, very black and very strange. He introduced her as Kali. She acknowledged the introductions with a nod but didn\u0027t say a word or appear to hear anything anyone else said for a good half hour, at which point she leaned forward, stared hard at Elaine, and said, \"Your aura is teal blue and very pure, very beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Elaine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a very old soul,\" Kali said, and that was the last thing she said, and the last sign she gave that she was aware of our presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny Boy didn\u0027t have anything much to report, and we mostly just enjoyed the music, chatting about nothing important between sets. It was fairly late when we left. In the cab to her place I said, \"You have a very old soul and a teal-blue aura and a cute little ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s very perceptive,\" Elaine said. \"Most people don\u0027t notice my teal-blue aura until the second or third meeting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to mention your old soul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, it would be a good idea not to mention my old soul. You can say what you want about my cute little ass. Where does he find them?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-walk-among-the-tombstones-matthew-scudder-10/page-18.html","bookId":2328,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:52:13 AM"}
