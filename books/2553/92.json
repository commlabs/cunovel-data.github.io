No turkey for our sim Christmas, I\u0027m afraid. Just two large pies - a plain and a sausage.\" He glanced at his two guests. \"Do either of you know what Christmas means, by the way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKek didn\u0027t even look up; he\u0027d been lured away from one of the computers where he\u0027d been engrossed inMortal Kombat XX , and now he grabbed a slice of the sausage pie and started wolfing it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Tome smiled and said, \"Lights and trees and presents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that\u0027s a big part of it. A time of peace on earth and good will toward men, I\u0027m told. But what about sims? Does that include good will toward sims?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZero had made the mistake of allowing himself a glass of holiday cheer: one Scotch and water. Terrible tasting stuff, didn\u0027t know how Ellis Sinclair had drunk so much of it all those years, but he\u0027d forced it down - the season to be jolly and all that. Now he wished he hadn\u0027t. Not used to alcohol, and though he wasn\u0027t feeling much in the way of physical effects, it seemed to have untethered his thoughts, leaving them to wander. Now they were wandering into terra incognita.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tome not know, Mist Zero.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot know what? Oh, yes...about good will toward sims.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you don\u0027t, Tome. Christmas has become a secular holiday for the most part, but it\u0027s still a religious occasion for those who celebrate the arrival of their god to save mankind. But what of us sims? Are we included in that salvation? Or are we damned?\" He toasted with a piece of plain pie. \"Joy to the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he felt no trace of joy, felt instead as if he were standing on the brink of a precipice, gazing into the unknown. The world as he\u0027d always known it was about to change. Radically. And with it his relationship to that world and all the people he knew in it. Nothing would ever be the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to imagine what it would be like to come out of hiding, to wander about with his face exposed to the world, to be aperson . He could not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe surprised himself by starting to sing: \"We three sims of chimpanzee blood, wondering how we\u0027ll ride out the flood...\" He noticed Tome and Kek staring at him. \"Come on, sing! You know the words!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then he couldn\u0027t go on, not with his throat constricting around a sob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat have I done? My race, my brother sims - what will happen to them when Meerm\u0027s baby is shoved in the face of the world? By saving them will I doom them to extinction? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sims/page-92.html","bookId":2553,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:37:47 AM"}
