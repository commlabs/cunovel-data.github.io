Pretty sure he wants to wait a lot longer than that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t push things with Ryle when it comes to speeding things up in our relationship. Our lives are perfect how they are. We’re too busy for a wedding anyway, so I don’t mind if he wants to wait a lot longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about you?” Allysa presses. “Would you say yes if he proposed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh. “Are you kidding me? Of course. I’d marry him tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllysa looks over my shoulder at her bedroom door. She purses her lips together and tries to hide her smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s standing in the doorway, isn’t he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He heard me say that, didn’t he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll onto my back and look at Ryle, propped up against the doorframe with his arms folded over his chest. I can’t tell what he’s thinking after hearing that. His expression is tight. His jaw is tight. His eyes are narrowed in my direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lily,” he says with stoic composure. “I would marry the hell out of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words make me smile the most embarrassing, widest smile, so I pull a pillow over my face. “Why, thank you, Ryle,” I say, my words muffled by the pillow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s really sweet,” I hear Allysa say. “My brother is actually sweet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pillow is pulled away from me and Ryle is standing over me, holding it at his side. “Let’s go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart begins to beat faster. “Right now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods. “I took the weekend off because my parents are in town. You have people who can run your store for you. Let’s go to Vegas and get married.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllysa sits up on the bed. “You can’t do that,” she says. “Lily’s a girl. She wants a real wedding with flowers and bridesmaids and shit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyle looks back at me. “Do you want a real wedding with flowers and bridesmaids and shit?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think about it for a second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three of us are quiet for a moment, and then Allysa starts kicking her legs up and down on the bed, giddy with excitement. “They’re getting married!” she yells. She rolls off the bed and rushes toward the living room. “Marshall, pack our bags! We’re going to Vegas!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyle reaches down and grabs my hand, pulling me to a stand. He’s smiling, but there’s no way I’m doing this unless I know for sure he wants it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure about this, Ryle?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe runs his hands through my hair and pulls my face to his, brushing his lips against mine. “Naked truth,” he whispers. “I’m so excited to be your husband, I could piss my damn pants.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Nineteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s been six weeks Mom, you gotta get over it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother sighs into the phone. “You’re my only daughter. I can’t help it if I’ve been dreaming about your wedding your whole life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe still hasn’t forgiven me, even though she was there. We called her right before Allysa booked our flights. We forced her out of bed, we forced Ryle’s parents out of bed, and then we forced them all on a midnight flight to Vegas. She didn’t try to talk me out of it because I’m sure she could tell that Ryle and I had made up our minds by the time she made it to the airport. But she hasn’t let me forget it. She’s been dreaming of a huge wedding and dress shopping and cake tasting since the day I was born.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kick my feet up on the couch. “How about I make it up to you?” I say to her. “What if, whenever we decide to have a baby, I promise to do it the natural way and not buy one in Vegas?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mom laughs. Then she sighs. “As long as you give me grandchildren someday, I guess I can get over it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRyle and I talked about kids on the flight to Vegas. I wanted to make sure that possibility was open for discussion in our future before I made a commitment to spend the rest of my life with him. He said it was definitely open for discussion. Then we cleared the air about a lot of other things that might cause problems down the road. I told him I wanted separate checking accounts, but since he makes more money than me, he has to buy me lots of presents all the time to keep me happy. He agreed. He made me promise him I’d never become vegan. That was a simple promise. I love cheese too much. I told him we had to start some kind of charity, or at least donate to the ones Marshall and Allysa like. He said he already does, and that made me want to marry him even sooner. He made me promise to vote. He said I was allowed to vote Democratic, Republican, or Independent, as long as I made sure to vote. We shook on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time we landed in Vegas, we were completely on the same page.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hear the front door unlocking so I flip onto my back. “Gotta go,” I say to my mother. “Ryle just got home.” He closes the door behind him and then I grin and say, “Wait. Let me rephrase that, Mom. My husband just got home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother laughs and tells me goodbye. I hang up with her and toss my phone aside. I bring my arm up above my head and rest it lazily against the arm of the couch. Then I prop my leg over the back of it, letting my skirt slide down my thighs and pool at my waist. Ryle drags his eyes up my body, grinning as he makes his way over to me. He drops to his knees on the couch and slowly crawls up my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How’s my wife?” he whispers, planting kisses all around my mouth. He presses himself between my legs and I let my head fall back as he kisses down my neck. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/it-ends-with-us/page-62.html","bookId":1823,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:23:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:23:27 PM"}
