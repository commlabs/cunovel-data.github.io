First he falls foul of the Duncans, a local clan that has terrified an entire county into submission. But it’s the unsolved, decades-old case of a missing child that Reacher can’t let go. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eThe Duncans want Reacher gone—and it’s not just past secrets they’re trying to hide. For as dangerous as the Duncans are, they’re just the bottom of a criminal food chain stretching halfway around the world. For Reacher, it would have made much more sense to put some distance between himself and the hard-core trouble that’s bearing down on him. For Reacher, that was also impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/worth-dying-for-jack-reacher-15.jpg","author":"Lee Child","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/worth-dying-for-jack-reacher-15.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:37 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:49 AM"}
