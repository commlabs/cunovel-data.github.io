Then one morning, when Reuben was at Robertsbridge market, he disappeared—Handshut could not find him to take his place in the lambing shed. Rose was angry, for she had wanted young Handshut to hang some curtains for her—one cause of disagreement between her and Reuben was her habit of coaxing the farm-hands to do odd jobs about the house.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That same evening, before her husband was back, a letter came for Rose. It was from Benjamin at Rye, announcing that he was sailing that night in the Rother Lady for Las Palmas. He was sick of the farm, and could not stand it any longer. Would Rose tell his father?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Rose was not sorry to see the last of Benjamin, whom she had always despised as a coarse lumpkinish youth, whose clothes smelt strongly either of pitch or manure. But she dreaded breaking the news to Reuben. She disliked her husband\u0027s rages, and now she would have to let one loose. Then suddenly she thought of something, and a little smile dimpled the corners of her mouth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Reuben came in tired after a day\u0027s prodding and bargaining in Robertsbridge market-place. Rose, like[Pg 271] a wise woman, gave him his supper, and then, still wise, came and sat on his knee.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ben ...\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, liddle Rose.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ve some bad news for you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wot?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Jemmy\u0027s gone for a sailor.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He suddenly thrust her from him, and the lines which had begun to soften on his face as he held her, reappeared in their old harshness and weariness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Gone!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes. I had a letter from him this evening. He couldn\u0027t stand Odiam any longer, so he ran away. He\u0027s sailed for a place called Palma.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Reuben did not speak. His hands were clenched on the arms of his chair, and for the first time Rose noticed that he looked old. A faint feeling of disgust came over her. She shivered, and took a step backwards as if she would leave him. Then her warm good nature and her gratitude to the man who had made her so happy, drove away the unnatural mood. She came close, and slipped her soft arms round his neck, pressing her lips to his.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He groaned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You mustn\u0027t fret, Reuben.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How can I help it?—they\u0027re all gone now save one ... my boys....\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Perhaps there\u0027ll be others.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She had slid back to his knee, and the weight and warmth of her comforted him a little. He lifted his head quickly at her words.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Others?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, why not?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her bold sweet eyes were looking into his and her mouth was curved like a heart.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Rose, Rose—my dear, my liddle dear—you d?an\u0027t mean——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course I mean. You needn\u0027t look so surprised. Such a thing has been known to happen.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"D?an\u0027t go laughing at me, but tell me—when?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In October.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, God! oh, God!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His rapture and excitement alarmed her. His eyes blazed—he threw back his head and laughed in ecstasy. Then he seized her, and crumpled her to him, covering her face, her neck, her hair, her ears, with kisses, murmuring broken phrases of adoration and gratitude.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Rose was definitely frightened, and broke free with some violence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, stop it, Ben! can\u0027t you see you\u0027re spoiling my dress? Why should you get in such a taking? You\u0027ve had children before, and they\u0027ve all been failures—I expect this one will only be like the rest.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59449.html","bookId":524,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 1:00:29 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 1:00:29 PM"}
