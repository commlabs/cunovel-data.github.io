Edur warriors with weapons slick and dripping. And already crows were descending to feed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you injured, Overseer?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrohl wiped blood from his face and shook his head. ‘Form ranks. We now march to the battle, to kill some more. To kill them all.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Yes sir!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMasarch stumbled his way clear, half blinded by the mud. Where was Redmask? Had he fallen? There was no way to tell. Clutching his side, where a sword-point had punched through the leather armour, and hot blood squeezed between his fingers, the young Renfayar warrior fought through the mud towards the platform-but the enemy were nearly upon it on the east flank, and atop that platform no-one remained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll he desired, at this moment, was to pull away from this mud, to clamber onto those wooden boards. Too many of his comrades had vanished into the cloying sodden silts, raising in his mind horrifying memories of being buried alive-his death night-when madness reached into his brain. No, he would not fall, would not sink down, would not drown with blackness filling his eyes and mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisbelief raged through him. Redmask, their great leader, who had returned, who had promised them triumph-the end of the Letherii invaders-he had failed the Awl. And now, we die. Our people. These plains, this land, will surrender even the echoes of our lives. Gone, for ever more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not accept that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet it is the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRedmask, you have slain us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached the edge of the platform, stretched out his free hand-the one that should have held a weapon-where had it gone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bestial scream behind him and Masarch half turned, in time to see the twisted, grey, cracked face beneath the helm, the white of eyes staring out from thick scales of mud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFire burst in Masarch’s chest and he felt himself lifted up, balanced on a sword’s hilt and its sliding stream of molten iron, thrown onto his back-onto the boards of the platform-and the Letherii was pulling himself up after him, kicking mud from his boots, still pushing with his shortsword-although it could go no further, no deeper, and the weapon was now jammed, having thrust through Masarch’s back and gouging deep into the wood. On his knees straddling the Renfayar, the Letherii, smeared teeth bared, stared down into Masarch’s eyes, and began tugging at his sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was speaking, the Awl realized, words repeated over and over again in that foul Letherii tongue. Masarch frowned-he needed to understand what the man was saying as the man killed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the world was fading, too fast-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, 1 hear you, soldier, yes. I hear, and yes, I know-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Letherii watched the life leave the Awl bastard’s young eyes. And though the Letherii’s teeth were bared as if in a smile, though his eyes were wide and bright, the words coming from him repeated their litany: ‘Keep me alive, please, keep me alive, please, keep me alive…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeventy paces away, Redmask pulled himself onto the back of his horse-one of the few left-and sawed at the reins to swing the beast round. He’d lost his whip, but the crescent axe remained in his hands, gore-spattered, the edges notched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGods, he had killed so many, so many, and there were more to come. He knew it, felt it, hungered for it. Heels pounded into the horse’s flanks and it surged forward, hoofs kicking up mud. Madness to ride on this, but there was no choice, none at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThousands of Letherii slain, more yet to butcher. Bivatt herself, yes-he rode towards the eastern side of the seething mass, well outside the encircling horn-oh, that would not last, his warriors would break through. Shattering the bastards and their flimsy lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRedmask would-once he was done with Bivatt-return to that slaughter-and yes, here were his K’Chain Che’Malle, thundering to join him. The three of them, together, thrusting like an enormous sword into the Letherii ranks. Again and again, killing all within reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSag’Churok closing in from his right-see those huge arm-swords lift, readying themselves. And Gunth Mach, swinging round to his inside flank, placing herself between Redmask and the jostling line of skirmishers with their pathetic spears-Gunth Mach was limping, but the spear had worked itself loose-or she had dragged it free. These beasts felt no pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they were almost with him, here, yet again, for they had chosen him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVictory this day! Victory!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSag’Churok drew yet closer, matching the pace of Redmask’s horse, and he saw it swing its head to regard him. Those eyes, so cold, so appallingly empty-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sword lashed out in a blur, taking the horse from the front, at the neck, just above its collarbones. A blow of such savagery and strength that it tore entirely through, cracking hard against the wooden rim of the high saddle. Knocking Redmask back, over the beast’s rump, even as the headless horse ran on another half-dozen strides before wavering to one side then collapsing. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-397.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
