It’s disturbing me, waking me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I realize that it’s my own finger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s moving on its own accord, twitching against the side of my leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to open my eyes, but my eyelids feel heavy and tired, like they have been glued closed. I try again and then again, and finally, finally, they open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the light hurts my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything looks like blurry shapes and fuzzy outlines and I blink, trying to clear things up. It doesn’t help. I blink again and it is so incredibly, frustratingly hard. My eyes don’t want to cooperate. After a few minutes, I finally bring things into a slightly clearer focus, but it’s not perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it’s enough to see a figure sitting in a chair by the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer head is bowed and I think she is asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have no idea where I am.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mia!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn’t asleep. The figure jumps to her feet and lunges to my side. Her face is anxious, frantic, hopeful. I stare at her in confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I don’t know her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I realize something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlarm slams into me, causing me to panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are you?” I ask her wildly. “Where am I?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis can’t be happening because I don’t know who I am. My heart is speeding, pulsing, threatening to burst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolyHell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolyHell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolyHell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grab her hand and look into her eyes. They are green and startled and instantly concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are you?” I beg her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tear drops from the corner of her eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m your mother,” she answers uncertainly and she reaches for the call button. She presses it, but then runs for the door, calling for a nurse. And then she stops at a sofa on the way back to my bed, and she shakes someone’s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I realize that someone is lying there. A man. And I didn’t even see him before. I wipe at my eyes and realize that they are covered in goop. I wipe at them again and my vision clears a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man approaches me with my mother, the mother that I don’t remember and don’t know, and he looks concerned. He’s tall and dark and has silver at his temples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I don’t know him, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mia,” he begins. “Do you know who you are? Do you remember what happened?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m panicky again. It feels like butterflies are banging their wings against my ribcage, trying to get out. I don’t blame them. I want to get out too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” I answer uncertainly. “Who are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m your father,” the strange man answers calmly. But he is interrupted by a nurse who comes through the door. When she sees that I am awake, she approaches me quickly, checking my pulse and looking into my eyes. She wipes the rest of the goop away and now I can see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother is crying and telling the nurse that I don’t know her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the nurse looks at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know who you are?” she asks gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head and my mother cries harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you remember anything that happened?” the nurse asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s alright,” she tells me and she pats my hand. “Everything will be alright.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause my parents are standing next to me and I don’t seem to remember them. And I don’t remember me, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I don’t see how in the world that can be alright.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m getting very, very panicky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA doctor comes in a few minutes later. He pokes and prods at me, too, in all the same places as the nurse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks into my eyes and listens to my heart and nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hear that you don’t remember very much,” he tells me. I nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry,” he tells me. “You’ve suffered a head injury. Your brain was swollen and you were placed in a medically induced coma to protect you. We reduced your medication yesterday and you woke up on your own accord today. Physically, you are fine, so do not worry about that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why can’t I remember anything?” I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctor’s eyes are kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because you’ve had a trauma,” he tells me. “As the swelling continues to decrease, your memory may come back. As time passes, it may come back that way too. Memory loss as a result of brain trauma is a tricky thing. But you are surrounded by people who love you and I have confidence that you will be fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow hard and my throat is sore. The doctor notices me wincing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You had a breathing tube,” he tells me. “You might notice some tracheal tenderness for a day or two.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTracheal tenderness. That sounds so medical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am still for a moment. My memory is a strange thing. As I think, I can remember bits and pieces of things. I see a car. A red convertible. I think it’s mine, but it might not be. I see a boat. I see underwater murkiness. But there is nothing else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at my mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry that I don’t remember you,” I tell her politely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Adrianna,” my father says sternly. “Mia doesn’t need this right now.” He pats her back awkwardly and I note that. My father isn’t great with affection, apparently. “You need to be strong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nods, but she’s still crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is my full name?” I ask my father. He looks slightly pained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mia Alexandria Giannis,” he tells me. The name doesn’t mean anything to me. Nothing at all. It doesn’t feel like me. But then again, I don’t know me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your middle name is after my mother,” he adds. “Your grandmother. You are very much like her. Very strong-willed and independent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrong willed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder about this. I don’t feel strong willed right this moment. I feel confused and tired. And weak. I don’t like the feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should rest,” my father tells me. And I realize that I don’t even know his name. So I ask and he looks pained again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s Stanyos,” he tells me. “Stanyos Alexander Giannis.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“After your mother?” I guess. He smiles and nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’s satisfied with me for some reason. I’ve done something right, but I don’t know what. Maybe he’s just proud of me that I woke up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What happened?” I ask. Because I realize that I have no idea what happened to put me into this condition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There was an earthquake,” my mother pipes up. Her eyes are red from crying. “You were grounded. And you sneaked away to go scuba diving. But that’s a good thing. If you’d been in your room like you were supposed to be when the quake happened, you might have been killed. For once, your rebelliousness was a good thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sounds a little bitter and my father gives her a hard look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Adrianna.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lowers her eyes and I know that I’m missing something. But I’m too tired to worry about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I like to scuba dive?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father smiles again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s your favorite thing in the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat makes sense. I only have a handful of memories that I can recall and they involve the water. I tell them that. My father smiles, my mother does not. She seems very upset about something that I don’t understand. But again, I’m too tired to make sense of it now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tell them this, that I am so very tired. And they tell me to get some sleep, that they aren’t going anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I close my eyes. But when you are a in a place that you don’t know, with strangers watching your every move and when, in fact, you don’t even know who you are… it is very hard to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I’m going to give it the old college try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I realize that I have no idea where that saying came from. Somewhere from the back recesses of my mind, probably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can tell already that this getting my memory back thing is going to be a long process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Seven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDays pass in a blur of strange faces and visitors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, all of my friends from school come to see me, all of the ones who weren’t also injured in the earthquake. And I don’t recognize any of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strange thing is that I know what everything around me is. I know the television, the bed, the bathroom, my slippers. I recognize how those things work. It’s like my memory has holes in it. I remember some things but everything else just dropped out of existence, like I never knew it at all. It’s frustrating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, apparently, I like red jello. It’s pretty much all I want to eat right now. The meat on my tray makes me want to gag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mother sighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mia, you’re not a vegetarian. You’ve never been a vegetarian. Just eat your food, alright? You need the strength and you’re not going to get it from jello alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe I should have been a vegetarian,” I announce, laying my spoon down and putting the cover back over my tray. I don’t even want to look at the greenish tinted hospital chicken. (Who in their right mind would eat that??) “And maybe I’ll become one now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mia,” my mother sighs again. “What has gotten into you today? You’re not normally like this…. so obstinate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare at her again. I’m not? So, I don’t usually have opinions? I must have been a very boring person. I’m prevented from responding by another visitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mia’s being obstinate? How out of character,” a dark-haired guy says wryly. He steps into the room and I wrack my brain. I was introduced to him a few days ago. Gavin. His name is Gavin. And we were-are- good friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi Gavin,” I tell him. I smile politely. It’s hard to pretend to be good friends with someone that I don’t remember. They all tell me that they understand, but there’s no way that they can. I just hope that I don’t accidentally hurt someone’s feelings by forgetting them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” Gavin tells me. He pulls up a chair next to me and I examine him. Dark hair, dark brown eyes, mischievous smile. Crisp white button-down shirt, open at the top, fancy blue jeans, flip-flops. He’s gorgeous. My tummy gets a little fluttery when he picks up my hand as if he knows me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I remember, he does know me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just don’t know him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you feel today?” he asks. “Are you driving the nurses crazy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, she is not,” My mother says firmly, even though clearly the question was meant for me. “She’s being polite and courteous, as she should be.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mia-s-heart/page-6.html","bookId":2762,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:06:21 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:06:21 PM"}
