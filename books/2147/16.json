I didn\u0027t know if he\u0027d say anything to Alexander and Stormy about his discovery or what he\u0027d say if he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHey, Stormy - why don\u0027t you show up in pictures or reflect in mirrors? I heard him say in my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept the conversation moving, and I bantered on about mundane topics and recent movies I\u0027d seen. Anything to keep my brother from talking about what he\u0027d seen - or rather, hadn\u0027t seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we arrived home, we were saying our good-byes when Billy spoke up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want that picture, remember?\" my brother said to me. \"Especially if Stormy is leaving soon, I want a picture of us together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not leaving soon,\" she said for us all to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s late,\" I interjected. \"They have to leave. Maybe next time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Billy had already placed his phone in Alexander\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStormy gladly stood next to Billy. It was as if she liked playing the part of the happy mortal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander looked at me as if I knew what to do. I turned away in frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander took the picture, then handed me the phone. I tried to hang on to it but Billy snatched it from me before I could delete the picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night, Stormy,\" Billy said. \"Good night, Alexander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night,\" they both said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly went inside, and I knew if I stayed for a long good-night kiss, he\u0027d have that picture already plastered on a social network site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was one thing to have Becky know the truth about Alexander and the other vampires\u0027 real identities - but quite another for my little brother to know. Could he keep a secret? I\u0027m sure he had already told Henry by now. The two must have been concocting their experiments like young Einsteins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blew Alexander a kiss and ran inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the family room, my mom was reading a magazine and my dad was watching college football. Billy was already upstairs in his room. I ran up the stairs and charged over to my brother and tried to grab his phone away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going toe yt Billy sn do?\" he asked. \"Kill me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be too easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you two doing?\" I heard my mom call from downstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you admit it?\" he questioned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I admit nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You saw what I just saw in the alley mirror,\" Billy said. \"Or rather, what I didn\u0027t see. You can\u0027t explain that away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what you saw,\" I said. \"You need glasses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have twenty-twenty vision,\" he asserted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly was fiddling with the phone, and I was ready to pounce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What reason could there be for not seeing Stormy in a mirror?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are just plain crazy!\" I shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like a fox,\" he said. \"I should have known.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you like Stormy?\" I asked. \"You think you are harassing me, but don\u0027t you see it is her who you are really hurting?\" For a moment Billy softened, until he saw the picture on his phone. Then his expression changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It can\u0027t be....\" he said, his voice trailing off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See, I told you that you were a fool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This means she\u0027s not the only one,\" he deduced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have many pictures of Alexander, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t want to admit anything to my brother - but I didn\u0027t know what to do. I was running out of excuses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you have any pictures of Alexander - that aren\u0027t painted - or one that isn\u0027t computer generated?\" Billy was fixated on me. \"Why is Stormy afraid of mirrors?\" he went on. \"How come she didn\u0027t show up in the mirror outside Shirley\u0027s? I\u0027ve never seen Stormy or Alexander in the daylight. And why are they all allergic to garlic?\" he asked. \"Even their parents were when they came over for dinner.\" He showed me his phone. There was just a picture of him - and an empty space where Stormy should have been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t mean anything!\" I said. \"Alexander moved, Stormy moved. Blah blah blah,\" I defended. \"It happens all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one moved,\" Billy argued. \"I have another one like it taken on the night of the dance printed out upstairs. That is why Alexander made me a portrait of me and Stormy. Because he knew I\u0027d never have a photo of her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So your phone is messed up,\" I charged. \"That explains it all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Billy looked at me right down in my soul. He was gearing up to take me down with his words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took the phone and shoved it in front of me. \"This is Henry\u0027s phone!\" he proclaimed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart plummeted. It was as if he was the detective in a whodunit novel and he was holding the stolen goods with my fingerprints on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was speechless. And so was Billy. It was as if all the color had washed away from his cherry-red cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re dating a vampire,\" Billy said, his voice quavering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know what to say. My brother looked to me for a response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust then my mom burst into his room. \"What is going on?\" she asked. \"No hellos? Only screaming?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh...\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just showing Raven this picture of me and Stormy,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, really? I\u0027d love to see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave my brother a stern glare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked to me. He knew that if he showed it to my mother, then he would be putting Stormy in jeopardy. I could see him contemplate if that was worth the joy of harassing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly turned to my mom. \"It didn\u0027t turn out,\" he said, putting the phone on his desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly turned to my mom. \"It didn\u0027t turn out,\" he said, putting the phone on his desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a shame,\" she said, disappointed. \"I would have loved to see you two together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would have, too,\" he mumbled under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, how was your evening?\" she asked us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We had a blast,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you, Billy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efonould be p\"Uh ... yeah, it was interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Interesting?\" she said. \"I thought you went to get ice cream. What is interesting about ice cream?\" I waited for my little brother to blab the News of the Underworld to my mom. I was ready to pounce on him when he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They had a new flavor,\" he said to me. \"Vampire bites.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I bet Raven loved that one,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded enthusiastically. I was biding my time, hoping my mother would leave so I could talk to Billy alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds like you both had a great time,\" she continued. \"I think this has been really wonderful for you. The fall dance. Now hanging out together. I think the Sterlings have bonded with you both and brought you two together. It\u0027s so sweet.\" We both smiled fake smiles, and my mom, happy with the children she dreamed for, left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you admit it!\" Billy Boy said to me when she was out of sight. He had obviously been waiting all night long to talk to me about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know what to say. All my excuses flew out of my head. I couldn\u0027t figure out anything anymore to explain the bizarre behavior of Alexander, Stormy, or their parents. I couldn\u0027t rationalize why they acted the way they did, and I wasn\u0027t sure I even wanted to anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t respond. Instead I started for my room but then turned around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for covering with Mom,\" I said. \"I know you did it for Stormy. But it really helped me and Alexander, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So ... it\u0027s really true,\" he said as if it was just sinking in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI headed over to him. \"You can\u0027t tell a soul.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are dating a vampire....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean it. No one can know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But don\u0027t you see? This is major news. The existence of vampires. Not just in folklore - but in reality.\" I leaned in to him with serious conviction. \"Your lips are sealed. Promise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I tell Henry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he has to know! We could win a lifetime achievement award at mend mthe school\u0027s science fair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need fifty media trucks parked outside the Mansion waiting to interview Alexander or Stormy to find that they don\u0027t show up on camera. He\u0027ll have to leave town. And that is not going to happen!\" I pinched his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, okay,\" he said, and I released him. Then he started processing the information. \"I went to a dance with a vampire,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll be the coolest kid in school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you, you can\u0027t tell anyone!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how will I be cool if no one knows?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered how Billy treated Stormy and danced with her in front of the entire school. And now, not blurting out the identity of my boyfriend to my mom. \"I think you already are the coolest one there,\" I said truthfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gazed up at me with little-brother eyes. It was as if they were the words he\u0027d been waiting to hear from me all his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Raven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does this mean that you\u0027ll...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does this mean that you\u0027ll become a vampire, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled at my brother and spoke to him honestly. \"I can only hope!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him a wink and started for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would totally rock!\" I heard him say as I headed out of his room. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/immortal-hearts-vampire-kisses-9/page-16.html","bookId":2147,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:20:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:20:23 PM"}
