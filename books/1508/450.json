If he wants to kill us, it will be too difficult. If we want to kill him, it won’t be easy either! I discovered that whenever the Blood Demon killed others, he would suck dry their blood essence. Most likely he is cultivating some sort of devil art. I even think he might be someone from the South Sea Demon Region who’s killing those like him in order to improve his devil arts.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Mm?” The skinny martial artist’s complexion changed.

These past days, those Revolving Core Elders have all been busy with some important event. As for what it is, I’m not too sure. They simply don’t have time to deal with something so minor like South Aurora Island.” Viper calmly said. For the last half year or so, the South Sea Demon Region had been deadlocked with the Wartime Alliance and hadn’t been able to advantage. Instead, both forces fought, causing massive amounts of death.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe most obvious point was that Revolving Core masters were participating in the war less and less. Both sides were engaged in a battle of attrition, and there were increasingly less disciples in the army. Those that went to fight were usually martial artists from small sects that served as cannon fodder. They were tempted by the rewards of Divine Phoenix Island and the South Sea Demon Region, and would most likely die on the battlefield.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWhat was the South Sea Demon Region trying to do?

There was a legend that in ancient times, an unrivalled war had been fought here, and countless powerhouses had died. A chilling wind blew all year around on Dark Moon Island, and the air was filled with a black fog. Many powerful and fierce ghosts were bred from this island.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis island was different from the neighboring Blood Demon Island. There was no true essence stone vein, and only endless dangers and traps. Thus, no one visited Dark Moon Island.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eIn the past, the Moon Seizing Sect had hidden their treasures in Dark Moon Island because of the security offered here. Not only was almost no one ever on Dark Moon Island, but there was also a strange phenomenon that occurred on Dark Moon Island, and that was that the black fog that permeated the island was able to inhibit one’s soul perception. As long as a secret entryway was hidden well, even a Revolving Core master wouldn’t be able to locate it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThis phenomenon had once roused the interest of many masters. They came to Dark Moon Island in droves to explore the land and discover the reason behind this. However, they weren’t able to obtain any results, and thus let the matter go at that.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs time passed, everyone slowly became accustomed to this strange phenomenon. No matter what level martial artist, no one would bother coming to this barren land.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eHowever at this time, there was a group of shadows shrouded in the thick black fog on Dark Moon Island. They were seven or eight black-robed old men, and on their robes was a dark blue design. This was a totem design of the Giant Demon race.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThese old men all had a cultivation at least at the middle Revolving Core realm. There were even late and extreme Revolving Core masters.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eBehind this group of old men stood 10 tall men, their entire bodies wreathed in bulging muscles. Their skin was a light blue hue; obviously they shared some blood with the Giant Demon race. However, there were varying degrees of the Giant Demon bloodline. These large fellows had a relatively poor Giant Demon bloodline. Compared to the Netherworld Great Emperor of the past, it was much worse.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThese 10 large fellows all had a cultivation at the late Xiantian realm. A long spear rested atop these large fellows’ shoulders, each one over 200 feet long and as thick as a water jar. It wasn’t known was sort of metal these spears were forged from, but the tips of the spears were extremely thin, like a drill.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“It’s here, let’s start!” An Elder held an array disc in his hands.

Rocks exploded; the 200 foot spear had sunk halfway into the ground.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Spin, dig all the way!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA black-robed Elder calmly said.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eWith \u0026nbsp;that, the 10 large fellows all extracted iron rods from their back as thick as an arm. They inserted these into slots on the spear!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“Hah!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe 10 large fellows shouted out together, and the muscles on their bodies bulged to ridiculous proportions. Their true essence revolved to the limit as they pushed these iron rods with all their strength. Slowly, the spear began to spin.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eKa ka ka –\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe sound of rocks bursting and cracking filled the air. The spear crushed through the earth with its tip, slowly spiraling downwards.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eEven with 10 late Xiantian masters revolving their true essence to the limit, they were only making progress with great strain and difficulty.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs an old man saw this he faintly smiled and said, “The rock bed here is truly tough. Even spears made of metal-breaking steel are just barely able to drill down.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The Demon Emperor’s letter is true!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAs the spear found it harder and harder to drill down, the several Revolving Core Elders began to use their own special techniques and methods to force the spear drill down. Slowly, the rock cracked, and a dark red liquid began to ooze out of the ground. This liquid was blood.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eAt the start, only a small amount of blood spurted out. But later, the blood began to shower out like a fountain. Finally the blood exploded like a geyser, flying dozens of feet into the air. Even the crushed rocks were sent flying away by this stream of blood.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“The seal is really here. The blood \u0026nbsp;pond seal and the blood from this blood pond were all absorbed from the ancient battlefield. This land is vast, and it was originally filled with the smell of blood. Because the black rock is able to block perception, no one was able to discover these even through so many years.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003e“There should be a total of six blood ponds.

At this time, the South Sea Demon Region had declared war upon Divine Phoenix Island. In truth, all of those martial artists that died on the battlefield were nothing more than pawns to be used in a blood sacrifice on an immeasurably vast scale! This was also the reason that they hadn’t advanced in such a long time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eThe large array created by the natural features of the land were able to gather blood to nourish the blood pond seal.

This war could be considered as exhausting Divine Phoenix Island’s strength ahead of time; it was a plan that killed two birds with one stone.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eA Revolving Core Elder couldn’t help but sigh as he said, “According to the Demon Emperor’s letter, the ancient battlefield that has been sealed away is in fact a small independent world.

As for these ancient battlefield, it was even more ancient than the Demon Emperor. In a way, this ancient battlefield where the broken world existed was the lair of the Demon Emperor.
