{"id":53577,"no":1252,"title":"Chapter 1248: Leaving the 33 Hells!","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChapter 1248: Leaving the 33 Hells!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rise to prominence.” What those words meant, and what they represented, was different now than what they had meant during his time in the Fang Clan. There, rising to prominence involved he himself flying to great heights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao was a member of the Fang Clan, and the Crown Prince of the direct bloodline at that. His father had a profoundly high cultivation base, and Meng Hao also had the support of the direct bloodline Elders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of that, rather than saying that he had helped the direct bloodline rise to prominence, it would be better to say that Meng Hao had been demonstrating his own worthiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe situation in the Meng Clan... was different. Based on the level of his cultivation base, he could earn himself a high position within the Meng Clan if he wanted to. However, unless he stayed with the Meng Clan in the Eighth Mountain and Sea forever, it would do no good. Once he left, the bloodline would be left waiting for his grandfather to return, and would be back in exactly the same position they had been in before Meng Hao had arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo rise to prominence with the Meng Clan meant... that the entire bloodline needed to rise, not just a single person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao stood there, lost in deep and somber thought. Meng Chen’s handful of words caused him to ponder the decline of his grandfather\u0027s bloodline, and the serious crisis they were now facing. The fact that they only had one Immortal Realm cultivator said a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt meant that the entire bloodline could be wiped away at virtually any time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, no one else in the clan would care at all about Meng Chen’s death, because it would have virtually no impact on the clan as a whole. But to his bloodline, it spelled out certain disaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir only Immortal Realm cultivator was dead....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did things come to this?” Meng Hao thought. He truly didn’t understand how, in less than a thousand years, a once flourishing bloodline could experience such a decline. There was really only one possibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All of the powerful experts died, leaving behind only widows and orphans....” Meng Hao trembled where he stood, his eyes bloodshot and his heart twinging with pain. He could well imagine the current situation in the bloodline, and it filled his heart with deep guilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe then silently made his way off into the distance, ignoring his plan to go find Han Qinglei. As of now, there was no need to rely on him to leave this place. Meng Hao would use Meng Chen’s identity instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the time it takes an incense stick to burn, rumbling sounds echoed out within the necropolis, and everything began to shake as a huge rift appeared. A terrifying power of expulsion also began to rise up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Greed’s memories, that was the way to leave this place. There was a small spell formation aperture which, when powered by Greed’s life force Essence, would open the exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the rumbling echoed out, Meng Hao took advantage of the expulsion power to shoot out through the rift. He was followed by a shocked Han Qinglei, who quickly turned back to look at the rift leading back to the necropolis. He realized that the only people to be disgorged were himself and this other person from the Meng Clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf all the other people, none emerged... not even Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis could only lead him to one conclusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dead? Impossible!” Han Qinglei simply couldn’t believe that Meng Hao had died inside. Suddenly, he thought back to the last moment in which he had seen Meng Hao, and how odd the situation had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHan Qinglei suddenly had a very bad feeling. Sighing, he turned and looked at the world around him, which was once again wreathed in mists. Roars could be heard therein, as well as the sounds of cultivators unleashing magical techniques.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked back at the Meng Clan cultivator who had been ejected from the necropolis along with him. The reason he could so easily identify him as coming from the Meng Clan was that all of the members of the Meng Clan who had come to this place had Immortal Realm cultivation bases, and currently, Meng Hao had suppressed his cultivation base down to that very level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everyone else died, how come he’s still alive...?” Han Qinglei thought, eyes glittering. However, just as he was about to examine Meng Hao closer, an enraged roar echoed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hungry... so hungry....” The sound was joined by the clank of iron chains. A moment later, a black iron chain shot out from the mists, causing mountains to crumble down below, and destroying a few cultivators who got in its way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mists seethed, and soon, a giant became visible, around whose enormous belly were wrapped numerous iron chains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral cultivators surrounded it, including Dao Realm experts, all of whom were engaged in fierce battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though the old man from the Heavengod Society had left after Meng Hao and the others had gotten sucked into the necropolis, obviously other cultivators had entered in search of good fortune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is this thing!?” Han Qinglei gasped. Although the mists made things difficult to see, it was possible to discern that the giant was actually covered by countless whisker-like tentacles, some of which were wrapped around the iron chains and the rest of which flailed about in the air. It was a truly shocking sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe creature was currently being besieged by numerous cultivators, many of whom appeared to be collecting the blood that dripped down from the tentacles surrounding the giant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHan Qinglei, who had just been distracted by all the figures in the mists, turned back only to find that the Meng Clan cultivator was gone. He looked once more in the direction of the necropolis, then let out a long sigh and buried his suspicions in his heart, flying up into the air toward the exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConcealed in the mists, Meng Hao watched Han Qinglei heading off. Keeping his head down, he followed along, waiting a bit after Han Qinglei actually left through the exit before flying toward it himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not that he was on guard against Han Qinglei, who had actually come here to save him. The friendship he had shown was something that Meng Hao would remember. However, it wouldn’t be very convenient to meet with him in his current identity. His speculations regarding what had happened to his grandfather’s bloodline still weighed heavily on his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Meng Hao flew up into the air toward the exit, someone spun out of control through the air toward him from off in the distance. It was an Ancient Realm cultivator, who had been attacking the giant and was now coughing up blood and had a very ashen face. Just now, the terrifying giant had swiped at him, and just the ripples of pressure from the blow had very nearly killed him. He was sent spinning tens of thousands of meters away, ending up right in front of Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao dodged to the side and then continued on his way up. The Ancient Realm cultivator was a middle-aged man, who wiped the blood off his mouth, glanced fearfully at the giant off in the distance, then looked at Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Immortal Realm? You actually dared to enter this place as an Immortal Realm cultivator? What sect are you from?” The cultivator’s eyes flashed as he flew forward to block Meng Hao’s path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Screw off!” Meng Hao said icily, not slowing down a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How dare you!” the man said with a cold snort. “Are you looking to die?!” As he shot toward Meng Hao, he reached out to grab him. Meng Hao frowned, eyes flickering with killing intent at the man’s obvious ill designs. However, before the man could get close, massive rumbling sounds filled the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surrounding mists began to seethe and churn. At the same time, the besieged giant suddenly became completely clear to Meng Hao’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was fully 3,000 meters tall and had a belly that was so fat it seemed almost like a sphere, surrounded by writhing tentacles. Were it not for the fact that it had a head and four limbs, it might look like a globe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt held an enormous cudgel in its hand, which it waved about as it roared, “Hungry... so hungry....”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts left hand suddenly reached out and grabbed a cultivator, then popped him into its mouth. Blood oozed out as the giant chewed the man up and then swallowed him down. All the while, the other cultivators surrounding the giant were looking on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao heard the miserable scream, and then watched as the man was swallowed down. Next, one of the giant\u0027s tentacles suddenly began to glow brightly as if there were some sort of crystalline liquid flowing inside of it. Immediately, the other surrounding cultivators, even the Dao Realm experts, began to attack that very tentacle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBooms rang out, and the tentacle shattered, causing numerous drops of crystalline fluid to scatter about, which the cultivators then snatched up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was at this point that a cold voice suddenly rang out in Meng Hao’s ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you see that? Now it\u0027s time for you to do me a favor. We\u0027re going to use your body to trade for some of that moon elixir!” It was none other than the middle-aged man, whose hand shot out like lighting to grab Meng Hao. Meng Hao didn’t even look back at him. He simply pointed his right index finger behind him and caused him to lurch to a stop, despite not even touching him. The man’s eyes went wide with disbelief as he suddenly lost all control of his body, and was rooted in place behind Meng Hao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAstonishment filled his eyes, and waves of shock filled his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao looked back thoughtfully at the giant. Suddenly, massive rumbling filled the air as a powerful force of expulsion rose up from within the world, filling the lands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat force of expulsion began to push the cultivators up into the air. Simultaneously, the roiling mists formed into numerous vicious faces, which roared as they shot toward the crowds of cultivators up above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if they were going to drive these people away!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost shocking of all was that the exit up above began to shrink, as if it were closing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately, the cultivators began to shout and fly up into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go, the exit’s closing! Get out of here!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The 33 Hells are only open for a limited time. They have an initial opening, a major opening, and a final opening. Each opening last longer than the last. Let’s go, we’ll have more chances later. From ancient times until now, anyone who has stayed behind after the exit closes has never been heard from again!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s too bad this gravesite is so barren. There was no mountain of weapons, and only one cultivator was buried here alongside the one who was suppressed....” The voices of the crowd echoed as everyone flew up toward the exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant was still roaring and attacking the crowds. The expulsion power grew more intense, and Meng Hao flashed toward the exit, dragging the middle-aged man along with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the crowds neared the exit and were about to leave, the giant all of a sudden looked at all of them, opened its mouth, and roared a Heaven-shaking, Earth-shattering roar. Its body swelled rapidly, and its tentacles extended rapidly. In the blink of an eye, you couldn\u0027t see its head or its limbs; it looked like a giant, 30,000-meter sphere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shocked cultivators watched as over 10,000 tentacles shot up into the air like lightning. Many of the cultivators were too slow, and were caught by them, after which rift-like mouths opened up on the tentacles and swallowed them down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone was in a pandemonium; by now, the exit was only about thirty percent of its original size. Everyone shot toward it as fast as possible, speeding out of the exit; as for the tentacles, they didn\u0027t dare to follow, and instead began to attack other people who hadn\u0027t escaped yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne tentacle shot toward Meng Hao, but as it neared, his hand made a grasping motion. Instantly, the middle-aged cultivator’s face flickered with fear and despair as Meng Hao tossed him out to the tentacle. It immediately consumed him, after which Meng Hao calmly stepped through the exit. As he did, he looked back at the huge 30,000-meter spheroid giant and its writhing tentacles, as well as the ferocious visages formed by the mist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, he left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1247\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1249\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-8-chapter-1248","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM"}
