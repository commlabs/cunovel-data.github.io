I just thought, knowing how puzzles are a great stress reliever for you, and given the circumstances . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllison could have sworn she gave an almost imperceptible nod toward Liam. \"Given what circumstances?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan didn\u0027t answer her. Noah had come up behind his wife and wrapped his arms around her waist. Allison envied how affectionate they were with each other. Their love was evident in every look, every action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She really is amazing,\" Noah said to Alec and Liam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah had firsthand knowledge. He had been at Nathan\u0027s Bay when Jordan\u0027s mother complained to her husband about a puzzle that was spread out on the dining table. According to Mrs. Buchanan, the judge had put it there over a month ago. Believing her husband would never finish it, she ordered that the puzzle be put back in the box. Then Allison happened to walk past. She stopped as soon as she saw the puzzle, stared at it a minute, and then began to put the pieces together at a dazzling speed. Noah stood in the doorway watching her and was soon joined by Jordan and her parents. He was certain Allison set some sort of record. Once she was finished, she sighed, turned around, and walked out into the sunroom, leaving her audience speechless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec set the bag on a chair. \"You wrapped her gift in a trash bag?\" he asked Jordan. \"That\u0027s kind of lazy, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan laughed as she defended herself. \"All the boxes are different sizes. How else do you wrap them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two began a silly debate about gift wrap, but Allison wasn\u0027t paying attention. She had suddenly guessed why Liam and Alec were there. She took a step back and shook her head. \"Oh no, you don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam noticed how pale her face had become. \"Oh no, what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going on?\" Alec asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me to do something else illegal for you, don\u0027t you? Did Agent Phillips send you? Does he know about this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan was outraged on her behalf. \"You are not going to make her do anything more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec put his hands up. \"Hey, we\u0027re on her side.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha,\" Allison scoffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does \u0026amp;lsquo;ha\u0027 mean?\" Liam wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wouldn\u0027t look at him when she said, \"It means I\u0027m not so sure you are on my side.\"\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiam decided Allison had ignored him long enough. She was obviously in a strange mood, and he couldn\u0027t figure out why. He was contemplating grabbing her and asking her what the hell was wrong with her when she finally turned her attention to him. She walked over to him, poked him in the chest, and said, \"I\u0027ve been following the contract, and I\u0027ve been more than compliant, Liam. Way more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Way more, huh?\" Liam repeated, and dared to smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been trying to get along with the man. He wore me down, and I finally agreed to this.\" She lifted her arm to show off her new bracelet. \"But that\u0027s it. I\u0027m not doing anything more to keep him happy. I\u0027m already working eighty-hour weeks. And I just found out he programmed his phone number in my cell phone. All I have to do is push the number one and he\u0027ll answer. Why he thinks I would want to call him is beyond me,\" she added. \"I\u0027m trying to get along, and Agent Phillips has absolutely nothing to complain about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJordan tried to calm her friend. \"I think it\u0027s sweet that Phillips gave you a graduation present. That\u0027s a pretty bracelet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a tracking device.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A what?\" Alec asked. \"Did you say a tracking-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I did. Liam, this isn\u0027t funny, so stop laughing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlec had more discipline. He just smiled. \"If you don\u0027t like the bracelet, take it off,\" he suggested. It sounded logical to him, and Noah\u0027s nod indicated he agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slapped her forehead. \"Why didn\u0027t I think of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m assuming that means \u0026amp;lsquo;What a dumb question,\u0027\" Alec said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"I can\u0027t take it off. It has to be cut off with a special tool I don\u0027t believe has been invented yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you agree to let him put it on you?\" Jordan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like I said, he wore me down,\" Allison admitted. \"Want to know one of his other numerous suggestions? He was real enthusiastic about this one. He thought it would be a good idea to put a tiny chip under my skin. That way he could always know where I was. Don\u0027t they do that to dogs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire time Allison had been ranting, her eyes were taking quick glances at the table. She moved closer and stared at the puzzle. She simply couldn\u0027t help herself. It was a quirk of hers, she supposed, although Charlotte called it a compulsion. She once asked Allison if the house were on fire but there was an unfinished puzzle, would she feel compelled to finish it before she left? Allison remembered she\u0027d told her it was a ridiculous question. Of course she\u0027d get out right away, but deep down she wasn\u0027t so sure. She might have been tempted to take the puzzle with her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-74.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
