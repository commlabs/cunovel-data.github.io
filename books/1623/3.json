No. No, I don\u0027t think so,\u0027 said Mort slowly. \u0027I don\u0027t think he\u0027s the marrying type.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Many a keen young man owes his advancement to his nuptials,\u0027 said Lezek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He does?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Mort, I don\u0027t think you\u0027re really listening.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLezek came to a halt on the frosty cobbles and spun the boy around to face him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027You\u0027re really going to have to do better than this,\u0027 he said. \u0027Don\u0027t you understand, boy? If you\u0027re going to amount to anything in this world then you\u0027ve got to listen. I\u0027m your father telling you these things.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort looked down at his father\u0027s face. He wanted to say a lot of things: he wanted to say how much he loved him, how worried he was; he wanted to ask what his father really thought he\u0027d just seen and heard. He wanted to say that he felt as though he stepped on a molehill and found that it was really a volcano. He wanted to ask what \u0027nuptials\u0027 meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat he actually said was, \u0027Yes. Thank you. I\u0027d better be going. I\u0027ll try and write you a letter.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027There\u0027s bound to be someone passing who can read it to us,\u0027 said Lezek. \u0027Goodbye, Mort.\u0027 He blew his nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Goodbye, dad. I\u0027ll come back to visit,\u0027 said Mort. Death coughed tactfully, although it sounded like the pistol-crack of an ancient beam full of death-watch beetle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWE HAD BETTER BE GOING, he said. HOP UP, MORT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Mort scrambled behind the ornate silver saddle Death leaned down and shook Lezek\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHANK YOU, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027He\u0027s a good lad at heart,\u0027 said Lezek. \u0027A bit dreamy, that\u0027s all. I suppose we were all young once.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath considered this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, he said, I DON\u0027T THINK so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gathered up the reins and turned the horse towards the Rim road. From his perch behind the black-robed figure Mort waved desperately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLezek waved back. Then, as the horse and its two riders disappeared from view, he lowered his hand and looked at it. The handshake . . . it had felt strange. But, somehow, he couldn\u0027t remember exactly why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort listened to the clatter of stone under the horse\u0027s hooves. Then there was the soft thud of packed earth as they reached the road, and then there was nothing at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down and saw the landscape spread out below him, the night etched with moonlight silver. If he fell off, the only thing he\u0027d hit was air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe redoubled his grip on the saddle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Death said, ARE YOU HUNGRY, BOY?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes, sir.\u0027 The words came straight from his stomach without the intervention of his brain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath nodded, and reined in the horse. It stood on the air, the great circular panorama of the Disc glittering below it. Here and there a city was an range glow; in the warm seas nearer the Rim there was a hint of phosphorescence. In some of thedeep valleys the trapped daylight of the Disc, which is slow and slightly heavy[1], was evaporating like silver steam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was outshone by the glow that rose towards the stars from the Rim itself. Vast streamers of light shimmered and glittered across the night. Great golden walls surrounded the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s beautiful,\u0027 said Mort softly. \u0027What is it?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE SUN is UNDER THE Disc, said Death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Is it like this every night?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEVERY NIGHT, said Death. NATURE\u0027S LIKE THAT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Doesn\u0027t anyone know?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eME. You. THE GODS. GOOD, IS IT?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Gosh!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath leaned over the saddle and looked down at the kingdoms of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI DON\u0027T KNOW ABOUT YOU, he Said, BUT I COULD MURDER A CURRY.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough it was well after midnight the twin city of Ankh-Morpork was roaring with life. Mort had thought Sheepridge looked busy, but compared to the turmoil of the street around him the town was, well, a morgue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoets have tried to describe Ankh-Morpork. They have failed. Perhaps it\u0027s the sheer zestful vitality of the place, or maybe it\u0027s just that a city with a million inhabitants and no sewers is rather robust for poets, who prefer daffodils and no wonder. So let\u0027s just say that Ankh-Morpork is as full of life as an old cheese on a hot day, as loud as a curse in a cathedral, as bright as an oil slick, as colourful as a bruise and as full of activity, industry, bustle and sheer exuberant busyness as a dead dog on a termite mound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were temples, their doors wide open, filling the streets with the sounds of gongs, cymbals and, in the case of some of the more conservative fundamentalist religions, the brief screams of the victims. There were shops whose strange wares spilled out on to the pavement. There seemed to be rather a lot of friendly young ladies who couldn\u0027t afford many clothes. There were flares, and jugglers, and assorted sellers of instant transcendence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Death stalked through it all. Mort had half expected him to pass through the crowds like smoke, but it wasn\u0027t like that at all. The simple truth was that wherever Death walked, people just drifted out of the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t work like that for Mort. The crowds that gently parted for his new master closed again just in time to get in his way. His toes got trodden on, his ribs were bruised, people kept trying to sell him unpleasant spices and suggestively-shaped vegetables, and a rather elderly lady said, against all the evidence, that he looked a well set-up young lad who would like a nice tune.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thanked her very much, and said that he hoped he was having a nice tune already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath reached the street corner, the light from the flares raising brilliant highlights on the olished dome of his skull, and sniffed the air. A drunk staggered up, and without quite realising why made a slight detour in his erratic passage for no visible reason. THIS IS THE CITY, BOY, said Death. WHAT DO YOU THINK?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It\u0027s very big,\u0027 said Mort, uncertainly. \u0027I mean, why does everyone want to live all squeezed together like this?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI LIKE IT, he said. IT\u0027S FULL OF LIFE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Sir?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYES?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What\u0027s a curry?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blue fires flared deep in the eyes of Death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHAVE YOU EVER BITTEN A RED-HOT ICE CUBE?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027No, sir,\u0027 said Mort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCURRY\u0027S LIKE THAT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Sir?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYES?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort swallowed hard. \u0027Excuse me, sir, but my dad said, if I don\u0027t understand, I was to ask questions, sir?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVERY COMMENDABLE, said Death. He set off down a side street, the crowds parting in front of him like random molecules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Well, sir, I can\u0027t help noticing, the point is, well, the plain fact of it, sir, is —\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOUT WITH IT, BOY.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027How can you eat things, sir?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath pulled up short, so that Mort walked into him. When the boy started to speak he waved him into silence. He appeared to be listening to something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHERE ARE TIMES, YOU KNOW, he said, half to himself, WHEN I GET REALLY UPSET.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned on one heel and set off down an alleyway at high speed, his cloak flying out behind him. The alley wound between dark walls and sleeping buildings, not so much a thoroughfare as a meandering gap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath stopped by a decrepit water butt and plunged his arm in at full length, bringing out a small sack with a brick tied to it. He drew his sword, a line of flickering blue fire in the darkness, and sliced through the string.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI GET VERY ANGRY INDEED, he said. He upended the sack and Mort watched the pathetic scraps of sodden fur slide out, to lie in their spreading puddle on the cobbles. Death reached out with his white fingers and stroked them gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a while something like grey smoke curled up from the kittens and formed three small cat-shaped clouds in the air. They billowed occasionally, unsure of their shape, and blinked at Mort with puzzled grey eyes. When he tried to touch one his hand went straight through it, and tingled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYOU DON\u0027T SEE PEOPLE AT THEIR BEST IN THIS JOB, aid Death. He blew on a kitten, sending it gently tumbling. Its miaow of complaint sounded as though it had come from a long way away via a tin tube.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re souls, aren\u0027t they?\u0027 said Mort. \u0027What do people look like?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePEOPLE SHAPED, said Death. IT\u0027S BASICALLY ALL OWN TO THE CHARACTERISTIC MORPHOGENETIC FIELD.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed like the swish of a shroud, picked the kittens out of the air, and carefully stowed them away somewhere in the dark recesses of his robe. He stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCURRY TIME, he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was crowded in the Curry Gardens on the corner of God Street and Blood Alley, but only with the cream of society – at least, with those people who are found floating on the top and who, therefore, it\u0027s wisest to call the cream. Fragrant bushes planted among the tables nearly concealed the basic smell of the city itself, which has been likened to the nasal equivalent of a foghorn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort ate ravenously, but curbed his curiosity and didn\u0027t watch to see how Death could possibly eat anything. The food was there to start with and wasn\u0027t there later, so presumably something must have happened in between. Mort got the feeling that Death wasn\u0027t really used to all this but was doing it to put him at his ease, like an elderly bachelor uncle who has been landed with his nephew for a holiday and is terrified of getting it wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other diners didn\u0027t take much notice, even when Death leaned back and lit a rather fine pipe. Someone with smoke curling out of their eye sockets takes some ignoring, but everyone managed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Is it magic?\u0027 said Mort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHAT DO YOU THINK? said Death. AM I REALLY HERE, BOY?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Yes,\u0027 said Mort slowly. \u0027I . . . I\u0027ve watched people. They look at you but they don\u0027t see you, I think. You do something to their minds.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHEY DO IT ALL THEMSELVES, he said. THERE\u0027S NO MAGIC. PEOPLE CANT SEE ME, THEY SIMPLY WONT ALLOW THEMSELVES TO DO IT. UNTIL IT\u0027S TIME, OF COURSE. WIZARDS CAN SEE ME, AND CATS. BUT YOUR AVERAGE HUMAN . . . NO, NEVER. He blew a smoke ring at the sky, and added, STRANGE BUT TRUE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort watched the smoke ring wobble into the sky and drift away towards the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I can see you,\u0027 he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHAT\u0027S DIFFERENT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Klatchian waiter arrived with the bill, and placed it in front of Death. The man was squat and brown, with a hairstyle like a coconut gone nova, and his round face creased into a puzzled frown when Death nodded politely to him. He shook his head like someone trying to dislodge soap from his ears, and walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath reached into the depths of his robe and brought out a large leather bag full of assorted copper coinage, most of it blue and green with age. He inspected the bill carefully. Then he counted out a dozen coins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCOME, he said, standing up. WE MUST GO.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMort trotted along behind him as he stalked out of the garden and into the street, which was still fairly busy even though there were the first suggestions of dawn on the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027What are we going to do now?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBUY YOU SOME NEW CLOTHES.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027These were new today – yesterday, I mean.\u0027 REALLY?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Father said the shop was famous for its budget clothing,\u0027 said Mort, running to keep up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIT CERTAINLY ADDS A NEW TERROR TO POVERTY.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey turned into a wider street leading into a more affluent part of the city (the torches were closer together and the middens further apart). There were no stalls and alley corner traders here, but proper buildings with signs hanging outside. They weren\u0027t mere shops, they were emporia; they had purveyors in them, and chairs, and spittoons. Most of them were open even at this time of night, because the average Ankhian trader can\u0027t sleep for thinking of the money he\u0027s not making.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Doesn\u0027t anyone ever go to bed around here?\u0027 said Mort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHIS IS A CITY, said Death, and pushed open the door of a clothing store. When they came out twenty minutes later Mort was wearing a neatly— itting black robe with faint silver embroidery, and the shopkeeper was looking at a handful of antique copper coins and wondering precisely how he came to have them. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mort-discworld-4/page-3.html","bookId":1623,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:05 PM"}
