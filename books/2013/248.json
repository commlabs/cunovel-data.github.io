Hundreds of the wretched creatures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Toblakai’s guards halted at this unexpected barrier, and Bugg saw the foremost one reel back as if assailed by a stench, then turn to argue with the others. Their ‘prisoner’, on the other hand, simply bellowed at the mob to clear the way, then walked on, shouldering through the press.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had gone perhaps twenty paces when he too drew to a halt. Shoulders and head above the crowd, he glared about, then shouted in a rude version of Malazan: ‘I know you! Once slaves of Sepik Island! Hear me!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaces swung round. The crowd shifted on all sides, forming a rough circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey hear. They are desperate to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I, Karsa Orlong, will give answer! So I vow. Your kin refuse you. They cast you out. You live or you die and neither matters to them. Nor to any in this cursed land. To your fate I offer nothing! In vengeance for what has been done to you, I offer everything. Now, go your way-your chains are gone. Go, so that never again will they return to you!’ With that, the Toblakai warrior moved on, towards the compound’s main gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot precisely what they needed to hear, I think. Not yet, anyway. In time, 1 suspect, it may well return to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, this-here and now-this demands another kind of leadership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guards had retreated, seeking another route.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe few citizens within sight were doing the same. No-one wanted to see this legacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBugg pushed himself forward. He drew upon his power, felt it struggle at this unseemly purpose. Damn my worshippers-whoever, wherever you are. I will have my way here! Power, devoid of sympathy, cold as the sea, dark as the depths. I will have my way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Close your eyes,’ he said to the mob. The words were little more than a whisper, yet all heard them, solid and undeniable in their minds. Close your eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey did. Children, women, men. Motionless now. Eyes closed tight, breaths held in sudden tension, perhaps even fear-but Bugg suspected that these people were beyond fear. They waited for what would come next. And did not move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will have my way. ‘Hear me. There is a place of safety. Far from here. I will send you there. Now. Friends will find you. They will bring healing, and you will have food, clothing and shelter. When you feel the ground shift beneath you, open your eyes to your new home.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sea did not forgive. Its power was hunger and swelling rage. The sea warred with the shore, with the very sky. The sea wept for no-one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBugg did not care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike any tidal pool motionless under the hot sun, his blood had grown… heated. And the smallest pool was filled with the promise of an ocean, a score of oceans-all their power could be held in a single drop of water. Such was Denaeth Rusen, such was Ruse, the warren where life was first born. And there, in that promise of life itself, will I find what I need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf empathy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf warmth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe power, when it came, was a true current. Angry, yes, yet true. Water had known life for so long it held no memory of purity. Power and gift had become one, and so it yielded to its god.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he sent them away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBugg opened his eyes, and saw before him an empty street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his room once more, Karsa Oflong lifted free his shoulder scabbard, then, holding the weapon and its harness in his hands, he stared down at the long table, on which sat an oil lantern set on low burn. After a moment he laid the sword and rigging down. And grew still once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany things to consider, a heaving of foam and froth from some struck well deep within him. The slaves. Cast out because their lives were meaningless. Both these Edur and the Letherii were heartless, yet cowards. Eager to turn away from witnessing the cost of their indifference. Content to strip fellowship from any whenever it suited them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet they would call him the barbarian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf so, then he was well pleased with the distinction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, true to his savagely clear vision of right and wrong, he would hold in his mind that scene-those starved faces, the liquid eyes that seemed to shine so bright he felt burned by their touch-hold to it when he faced Emperor Rhulad. When he then faced every Letherii and every Edur who chose to stand in his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he had vowed, and so all would witness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis cold thought held him motionless for another dozen heartbeats, then a second image returned to him. Icarium, the one they called Lifestealer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been moments from breaking that Jhag’s neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he had seen in the ash-skinned face… something. And with it, recognition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would yield to Karsa. He had given his word, and Karsa now knew that would not be broken. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-248.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
