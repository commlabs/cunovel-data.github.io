She stared at Fu Hongxue with an astonished look on her face. “I’m not Zhuo Yuzhen? Why do you say that I am not Zhuo Yuzhen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue did not answer her. Instead, he asked a question he should not have asked. “How many months pregnant are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen hesitated for a while, before finally saying, “Seven months.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “You’ve already been pregnant for seven months, but your father only just found out about it today? Is he blind?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “He isn’t blind, but he also isn’t my real father.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer voice was filled with hatred. “He knew about this all along. He was the one who arranged for me to meet with Qiu Shuiqing, because Qiu Shuiqing was a famous figure of the martial world and the master of the Peacock Manor, as well as the person whom escort-chief Liu admired the most.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei interjected, “Escort-chief Liu? Liu Zhenguo, of the Zhenyuan escort agency? Your father is a trainer for the Zhenyuan escort agency?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “He used to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “And now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “He drinks too much alcohol. No escort agency wants a martial arts instructor who is drunk all the time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “Escort-chief Liu dismissed him from his service?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen nodded. “Escort-chief Liu wasn’t necessarily against drinking alcohol, but after drinking, father actually mistook one of his fellow dart-instructors for a thief and even chopped off one of his hands. That was too excessive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “He wanted to make use of the relationship you had with Qiu Shuiqing to return to the Zhenyuan escort agency?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “He really wanted to! Even if I truly was his daughter, he still would have done the same thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “Unfortunately, Qiu Shuiqing wasn’t willing to do this. In addition, Liu Zhenguo wasn’t a person who showed favoritism.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “Thus, even though Qiu Shuiqing gave him a hundred taels of silver as drinking money every month, he still was not satisfied. Whenever he became drunk, he would think of ways to torment me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “And it wasn’t until today that you felt you could take no more?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen forced herself not to cry. “I am female. Officially, I am his daughter. No matter what he does to me, I can take it. Only, this morning…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “What did he do this morning?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “He wanted to beat the baby in my stomach to death. He didn’t want me to give birth to Qiu Shuiqing’s child, because…because he knows about the destruction of the Peacock Manor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei’s face changed. “But that happened only last night. He shouldn’t have known about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “But he did know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei’s face sunk. Fu Hongxue’s face became all the more pale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly one type of person would get the news so soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if he himself hadn’t personally gone to the Peacock Manor to kill people last night, he definitely was a lookout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “If I saw so many innocent people being wrongfully killed, when I got back home, I would’ve wanted to get really drunk as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue was silent. Suddenly, he said, “Do you know Liu Zhenguo? What type of person is he?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “The Zhenyuan escort agency covers a lot of territory. It isn’t an easy task to become the leader of the agency.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Is he good at using human resources?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “All of his subordinates are experts and first-class experts.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue’s hands tightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “My foster-father’s martial arts abilities are not weak. If alcohol hadn’t harmed him, he might have become the leader as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue coldly said, “It is very hard to be the leader of an escort agency. It is very easy to kill people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “You believe him to be one of the killers?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Not a killer, an accomplice!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “Then we should go find him right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “When we got into the carriage, I already issued orders to the driver. We are already headed in the right direction.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen looked directly at him. Liars definitely would not dare to stare into his eyes, and they definitely wouldn’t be so calm and collected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei looked at her, then looked at Fu Hongxue. It seemed as though he too had some opinion he wished to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut before he had even opened his mouth, a person loudly said, “We definitely cannot go to the Zhuo family right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin was awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had lost too much blood and her body was too weak. Clearly, she had used all of her available energy to say these words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei helped her lie down in a more comfortable position before asking, “Why is it that we cannot go to the Zhuo family?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin panted, “Because there definitely must be a trap there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn her urgency to explain her line of thinking, her pallid face began to turn red. “Gongsun Tu definitely wouldn’t let us off so easily. Naturally, he’ll realize that we’ll want to hunt down Zhuo Donglai. They have many people, all of whom are experts, and now I am injured.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei wouldn’t let her finish. “I understand what you are trying to say, and so does Fu Hongxue.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin said, “No, you do not understand. I’m not saying this out of fear for myself, and I know that the two of you are definitely enough to deal with them. But what about Miss Zhuo? You two will have to defend against Yang Wuji’s sword, Gongsun Tu’s hook, and Xiao Siwu’s flying dagger. How will you have the extra energy to look after her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue did not speak, nor did he respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin looked at him. “You absolutely must listen to me this time. We should have the carriage come to a stop immediately.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “No need.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin said, “Why…why aren’t you willing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue’s features were still totally expressionless. He dully said, “Because this road isn’t the road which will take us to the Zhuo family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin was startled. “It isn’t? Why isn’t it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Because from the very beginning, I ordered him to take this carriage out of the city as quickly as possible. How would he dare to go on any other road?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin let out a relieved breath. “So you had the same line of thought as I did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue coldly said, “I never take risks with the lives of others.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin said, “But just a while ago…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “I only said what I said in order to test Miss Zhuo.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut before he finished his words, the carriage came to a halt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe carriage driver turned around. Grinning, he said, “We’ve already reached the outskirts of the city. Hero Fu, which road do you want to take?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue coldly stared at his smiling face. He suddenly asked, “Have you learned the martial arts of the Boundless Pre-Heaven Sect?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe carriage driver’s smile suddenly turned stiff. “I’ve never learned any martial arts at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue ignored him. He asked again, “Are Zhao Wuji and Zhao Wuliang your teachers or your family elders?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe carriage driver stared at him in shock, as though he had seen a ghost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was very skilled at driving carriages. This entire time, he had sat in the front, driving the carriage. Not only had he not performed any actions, he had been very obedient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe really could not understand how this pale-faced freak managed to determine his origins with a single glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “The color of your skin is smooth, and the texture is finely detailed, as though it had been boiled in oil. Only a person who has practiced the martial arts of the Boundless Pre-Heaven Sect would be like this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a keen eye this freak had!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe driver finally let out a sigh. With a forced smile, he said, “I am Zhao Ping. Zhao Wuji is my father.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Are you nicknamed ‘forefinger’?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhao Ping forced himself to nod. He could already tell that lying to this freak would be extremely unwise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Based on your family background, you should not be doing such shameless things in secret. I should help the Boundless Pre-Heaven Sect purge itself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhao Ping’s countenance changed. “But I…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue didn’t let him speak. He coldly said, “If it weren’t for the fact that you are the only son of Zhao Wuji, you would already be dead and underneath the wheels of this carriage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was sitting in the carriage. He hadn’t even moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most flexible finger was the forefinger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could a man sitting in a carriage without moving kill Zhao Ping, who was as flexible as a forefinger?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhao Ping finally understood. He was about to rise up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “I will not kill you today. I will only require that you leave behind one of your murderous hands!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhao Ping suddenly laughed loudly. “I apologize. My hands are still useful, and so I cannot give them to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, a saber flash could be seen, followed by a flowering explosion of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhao Ping’s form rose up in alarm. He suddenly saw a bloody hand fall down from thin air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still hadn’t realized that this was his own hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sabre was too fast. He still hadn’t felt any pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe even was still laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly after the hand fell to the floor did he realize that he was missing one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of his laughter immediately turned into a miserable cry. His body tumbled down heavily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sabre flash had disappeared. The sabre had been sheathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue still remained seated in the back without moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhao Ping bound his severed wrist with fabric from his clothes. With his sole remaining hand, he rolled up the window of the carriage, staring at Fu Hongxue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “You still aren’t leaving?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGritting his teeth, Zhao Ping said, “I am not leaving. I want to see your sabre.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “My sabre isn’t for viewing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhao Ping said, “You chopped off my hand. You should at least allow me to see your sabre.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue stared at him, then suddenly said, “Fine. Look!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sabre flash. Strands of severed hair floated in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Zhao Ping’s hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time he saw these strands of severed hair, the sabre flash had disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sabre had been sheathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still hadn’t seen the sabre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was contorted with terror. He suddenly took one step backwards after another. He cried out in alarm with a hoarse voice, “You aren’t human. You are a vicious ghost. You are using an evil sabre!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pitch-black sabre. A pair of pitch-black pupils.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen was also staring at the sabre. She also stared at it for a long time. Her eyes were filled with terror as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed as though this sabre had become physically grafted onto Fu Hongxue’s hand. It had become part of his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen asked probingly, “Have you ever put this sabre down?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Never.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “Can you let me see it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “Have you ever let anyone see it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Never!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “Is this really a evil sabre?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “The evil lies not in the sabre. It lies within the heart. If a person holds evil within his heart, he will not be able to avoid this sabre!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not move. The carriage did not move either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei let out a sigh. “It seems as though there’s no longer any place for us to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “There is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “Where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Peacock Manor.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei was very surprised. “Peacock Manor again? What’s left there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “A secret cellar.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei immediately understood. “You want Mingyue Xin to hide herself there to recuperate?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “No one will guess that she is there. That place is a place of death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “Would this, then, be considered rebirth in a place of death?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “Will we still use this carriage?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Carriages cannot reveal secrets, nor can they betray people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “Only people can betray people. That’s why you got rid of Zhao Ping.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Correct.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “Who will drive our carriage now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “You.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough a big hole had been blown into the stone wall of the hidden cellar, the rest of it was as solid as it ever was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “Now, the only way a person can leave this place is through this hole.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “There can be leaving, but there cannot be a person leaving.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Because Mingyue Xin still has the Peacock Plume.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “Her Peacock Plume is still useful?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “It is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “So long as she stands guard here with her Peacock Plume, nobody will be able to charge in?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Nobody.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei sighed. “No matter what, I hope that no one else will come here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen couldn’t help but say, “Do you intend to leave her here by herself?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “Who will stay behind with her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “You.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “How about you guys? Are you leaving?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “Where are you going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “We are going to kill people!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “Are you going to kill those murderers?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue nodded. “Gongsun Tu won’t let us off. Nor can I let him off!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen stared at the sabre in his hand. “Do all murderers have evil in their heart?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “Will he definitely be unable to avoid your sabre?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Definitely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen suddenly knelt down, and her tears began to flow. “I beg you, bring his heart back here. I want to use his heart as a sacrifice to memorialize the father of my child.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue stared at her. He suddenly said, “I can do this sort of thing, but you cannot say that sort of words.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Because those words contain a murderous aura.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “Are you afraid that the child in my belly will be contaminated by the murderous aura?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue nodded. “A child with a murderous aura will find it difficult to avoid killing others when he grows up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen gritted her teeth. “I hope he will kill others. It’s better to kill others than to be killed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “You are forgetting one thing!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “Go ahead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Killers will themselves be killed, sooner or later!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was gloomy and dark. Even the tables and the chairs were made out of stone. They were both hard and cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin, however, was seated very comfortably, because before he left, Fu Hongxue gave her all of the mattresses in the carriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen also was given one of the soft mattresses from the beautiful carriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Fu Hongxue left, she couldn’t help but sigh. “I didn’t imagine he was such an attentive person.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin said, “He’s a weird person. Yan Nanfei is weird as well. But both of them are people, and both of them are men, real men.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “It seems that both of them treat you pretty well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin said, “I treat them pretty well as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “But in the end, you’ll have to choose between them. One woman can’t be married to two men.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin forced out a laugh. “I’ve already made my choice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “Who have you chosen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin said, “Myself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lightly continued, “Although a woman can’t be married to two men at once, she can refuse to marry either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen shut her mouth. Naturally, she could tell that Mingyue Xin was unwilling to discuss this any further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin gently stroked the Peacock Plume. Her hands were even colder than gold. Something was weighing on her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid the words of Zhuo Yuzhen provoke her thoughts?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long time, Zhuo Yuzhen suddenly asked, “Is the Peacock Plume in your hands real?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin said, “It is not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “Can I see it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin said, “You cannot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen couldn’t resist asking, “Why not?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin said, “Because even though it isn’t the real Peacock Plume, it is still a tool for killing people, and it carries a murderous aura. I, too, am unwilling to allow the child in your stomach to be contaminated with a murderous aura.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen looked at her. She suddenly laughed, “Do you know why I am laughing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin said, “I do not!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “I suddenly feel as though your speech mannerisms are absolutely identical to those of Fu Hongxue. Therefore…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin said, “Therefore?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen laughed again. “Therefore, if you absolutely had to marry someone, I think you would definitely marry him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin laughed as well, but her laughter was very forced. “It’s a good thing that I do not absolutely have to marry someone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen hung her head. “But I do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin said, “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen sadly said, “Because of my child. I can’t allow him to be without a father.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin also couldn’t resist probing further. “Who do you want to be his father?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen said, “Naturally, I would want a real man, a man who could protect me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin again couldn’t resist asking, “A man like Fu Hongxue?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen actually did not deny it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMingyue Xin’s laughter became even more forced. “Do you know how heartless he is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Yuzhen faintly smiled. “Sentimental or heartless. How can one really tell?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are we still riding this carriage?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mmhmm.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who should be the driver now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei finally couldn’t control his anger. “Why is it still me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Because I don’t know how.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei started. “Why is it that whenever I hear your words, I am startled?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Because I speak the truth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei could only leap onto the front of the carriage. Whipping the horse, he said, “See? This isn’t very hard at all. Everyone knows how. Why don’t you learn how?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Since everyone knows how, then anyone can drive for me. Why must I learn?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei was startled yet again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You really do speak nothing but the truth.” He shook his head, a wry smile on his lips. “But I wish you would tell a lie once in a while.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because the truth never seems to be as comfortable as a lie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe carriage moved forward. It travelled for a very long time. Fu Hongxue was meditating the entire time. He suddenly said, “You recognize the person who was playing chess with Yang Wuji?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei nodded. “He is called Gu Qi. He one of Gongzi Yu’s major subordinates.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “I hear he has four master martial artists in his employ. Together, they are known as ‘Zither [Qin], Chess [Qi], Calligraphy [Shu], Art [Hua]’.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “There are five master martial artists. Yu Qin, Gu Qi, Wang Shu, Wu Hua, and Xiao Jian [Sword].”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “You have met all five of them?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “I only met three. At that time, Gongzi Yu hadn’t met Yu Qin and Xiao Jian.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue stared at him. “When was that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei shut his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue refused to let it drop. He continued to ask, “Was it when you and Gongzi Yu often met with one another?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei’s mouth was still shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “You know all of his secrets. You are very familiar with all of his highest ranking subordinates. Naturally, the two of you had many dealings in the past.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei did not deny it. He could not deny it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “What type of relationship do the two of you have, exactly?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei coldly said, “Everyone always says that you value your words as highly as gold. Why do I always feel as though you are an overly talkative person?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Because you will not lie, but are afraid to tell the truth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “Right now, I am talking about you, not me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “But the one I am talking about is you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “Can we talk about something else? Even now, I still have no idea where you are taking us!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “You know. In order to kill a hunter, you must go to the place where he has set his traps.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “The home of Zhuo Donglai then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Originally.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “No longer?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Dead people have no homes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “Zhuo Donglai is already a dead man?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Thus, that place is now nothing more than a trap.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei let out another sigh. “I only hope that those hunters are still there and have not left.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “They probably have not yet left. To be a hunter, the first thing one must learn is patience.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai really was a dead man. Even his corpse was ice cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn’t strange at all. If one’s chosen profession is murder, the first thing one should learn is how to silence witnesses! So long as you join assassins in even one of their activities, you should be prepared to be killed and silenced at any point in time. In their eyes, a person’s life definitely was not worth more than that of a wild dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai had been killed like a wild dog, beneath the tree in the courtyard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue saw him from afar. His eyes were filled with sorrow and melancholy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLife was originally a precious thing. Why is it that some people simply refuse to cherish it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pitied this man, perhaps only because he himself had been ruined by the word ‘alcohol’ before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlcohol wasn’t a bad thing in and of itself. The problem lies within one’s self.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you yourself are willing to sink into vice and are unable to extricate yourself, then there is definitely no one in the entire world who can rescue you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei’s thoughts and feelings on this clearly were not as deep as his. He was still young. His heart was still filled with lofty ideals and aspirations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus, he only wanted to ask, “The trap is here. Where are the huntsmen?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue was silent. Before he had a chance to open his mouth, there was a light cry from the back of the house. “Ware the dagger!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dagger gleamed, looking like a bolt of lightning as it flew towards his back. Fu Hongxue did not dodge, did not move. It was his sabre which moved!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a clanging sound, sparks exploded in all directions. A dagger flash filled the sky, appearing as though it had pierced through the clouds and left the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue’s sabre was already sheathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei let out a breath. “Looks like at least one person remains here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue dully said, “I can tell that he has long since learned the art of patience.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as they finished these two sentences, the dagger flash fell down from the heavens. When it fell down, it fell down in two parts as the parts crashed down to earth like meteorites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the handle and blade of a flying dagger!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe four inch long flying dagger had been snapped in half.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flying dagger had attacked him, but his sabre had countered the dagger. The dagger flew many meters up into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho could imagine the speed with which this flying dagger had been sent out?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut with a backwards flip of his sabre, Fu Hongxue had deflected this knife, snapping in half its blade, which had been refined and smelted a hundred times over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone sighed from within the room. “Truly an incomparable sabre technique. You did not misspeak.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue slowly turned around. “Why haven’t you left yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as he turned around, he saw Xiao Siwu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Siwu walked out empty-handed. He coldly said, “The ‘four withouts’ of my name does not include ‘without shame’. Even if I were to leave, I would leave openly and with dignity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no dagger in his hands, appearing as though he were a virgin who had suddenly been stripped naked. He didn’t even know what he should do with his hands now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he did not flee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue looked at him. “You have only one dagger?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Siwu said, “The person I came to fight today is you. I can only bring one dagger!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Siwu said, “Because I know that the first dagger is the last dagger. Thus, when I strike out with that first dagger, I must use all of my strength.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “You forced yourself into a deadly situation, so that when you strike, you would strike whole-heartedly?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Siwu said, “Precisely so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slowly added, “In addition, after I strike with that first dagger, I must succeed in landing the strike. Otherwise, even if I had hundreds or thousands of other daggers, none of them would land.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue stared at him. He suddenly waved his hand. “Well said. Leave!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Siwu said, “You are letting me leave?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “I am not going to kill you this time, only because you said three words.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Siwu said, “What three words?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Ware my dagger!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he sent out his flying dagger, he had given a warning. This definitely was not how a despicable, contemptible man would act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “My sabre only kills evil, deceitful people. Your dagger is evil and deceitful, but you yourself are not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Siwu’s hands suddenly clenched. A strange expression suddenly appeared in his eyes. After a long time, he slowly said, “If I had not said those three words, would you have been able to defeat my dagger?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “You regret it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Siwu said, “Not regret. I just want to know the truth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue stared at him for a long time. He coldly said, “If you had not said those three words, you would be a dead man right now!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Siwu did not say a single word further. He turned around and left. He walked very quickly, and did not look back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone else sighed in the room. “Even if he does not regret it, you will regret it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man slowly walked out, dressed in black clothes and white socks. It was Gu Qi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue said, “Regret it? Regret what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu Qi said, “Regret not killing him!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue’s hands clenched tightly. He had two chances to kill that arrogant youngster, but he had given up both of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu Qi said, “Once a golden opportunity is missed, it will never come again. If you want to kill someone, abstain from nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, then continued. “This time, you did not kill him. I fear that next time, you will die to him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue stared at him. He suddenly laughed coldly. “And you? Should I kill you this time?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu Qi said, “That depends. Do you want to kill my central pieces, or the great dragon I have to the right? Are you playing the white pieces, or the black pieces?” [These are, obviously, all chess references.]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFu Hongxue did not understand. He did not play chess. Only people of leisure played chess. Whenever he had free time, he gripped his sabre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus, Gu Qi could only laugh alone. “What I meant to say is, you cannot kill me, you can only kill my chess pieces, because I only know how to play chess. In addition, this chess game is between you guys. I am not involved. You cannot even kill my chess pieces.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmiling, he walked past Fu Hongxue. He knew that Fu Hongxue definitely would not strike, because he did not guard himself at all and anyone could kill him. But Fu Hongxue was not anyone. Fu Hongxue was Fu Hongxue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei watched as he walked away. He suddenly laughed. “Looks like you didn’t make the wrong move.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu Qi said, “But I lost three games in a row today.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “You lost to Yang Wuji?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu Qi said, “He is the only one who can beat me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu Qi said, “Because he treats killing chess pieces the same way as he treats killing people. He abstains from nothing at all, whereas I have burdens on my mind.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYan Nanfei said, “Burdens on your mind?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu Qi said, “I am afraid of losing at chess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly people who fear losing at chess will lose chess matches that they should not have lost. The more they are afraid, the more they will lose. The more they lose, the more afraid they become.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly people whose hearts are filled with fear will kill people they should not kill. Fear of justice.
