She poked holes into a paper plate and wove the ribbons through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s that for?” I asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your bouquet for the rehearsal, silly,” Lucinda said, beaming at me. She’d been tanning that morning. I could tell because you could see the marks her goggles had left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, we’re not having a rehearsal dinner,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause what was there to rehearse? We were getting married on the beach. It was going to be simple and uncomplicated, the way we both wanted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylor handed the plate to me. “Then you have to wear it like a hat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucinda got up and tied the paper plate around my head like a bonnet. We all laughed as Marcy took my picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaylor stood up, holding her notebook. “Okay, so get ready for what Belly’s going to say on her wedding night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI covered my face with my ribbon hat. I’d heard of this game before. The maid of honor writes down all the stuff the bride-to-be says while she’s opening presents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“‘Oh, so pretty!’” Taylor exclaimed, and the room tit-tered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to grab the notebook from her, but she held it above my head and read, “‘Jeremiah’s gonna love this!’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the toilet-paper wedding dress competition, after we helped clean up and everyone had left, I walked my mother to her car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt shy as I said, “Thank you for coming, Mom. It means a lot to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe brushed my hair out of my eyes. “You’re my girl,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI threw my arms around her. “I love you so, so much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called Jeremiah as soon as I got in my car. “We are so on!” I shouted. Not that we ever weren’t. Still, planning this wedding, being away from home, being in a fight with my mom—it’d had me in knots. But with my mother by my side, I finally felt like I could breathe again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy worries were gone. I finally felt complete. I felt like I could do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night, I slept at home. Steven and my mom and I watched crime TV, one of those shows where they re-create crimes. We howled like wolves at the horrible acting, and we ate Fritos and the rest of my mother’s lemon squares. It was so good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 41\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe day Belly went home, I went to visit Ernie, the old owner of the seafood restaurant I used to bus tables at.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery kid who ever went to Cousins knew who Ernie was, just like Ernie knew every kid. He never forgot a face, no matter how old he got. Ernie had to have been at least seventy years old when I worked there in high school. His nephew John was running the place now, and he was a prick. At first he demoted Ernie to bartend-ing, but Ernie couldn’t keep up, so John had him roll silverware. John ended up cutting him out of the business completely, forcing him into retirement. Sure, Ernie was old, but he was a hard worker, and everybody loved him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to take smoke breaks with him outside. I knew it was wrong to let him bum a cigarette, but he was an old guy, and who can really say no to an old guy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnie lived in a small house off the highway, and I tried to go out and see him once a week at least. To keep him company but also to make sure he was still alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnie didn’t have anybody around to remind him to take his medicine, and his nephew John sure as hell wasn’t coming by to visit. After John pushed him out of the business, Ernie said John wasn’t his blood anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I was pretty surprised when I pulled onto Ernie’s street and saw John’s car on its way out. I parked in front of the house and knocked once before I let myself in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you bring me a cigarette?” Ernie asked me from the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the same thing every time. He wasn’t even allowed to smoke anymore. “No,” I said. “I quit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then get the hell out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he laughed the way he always did, and I sat on his couch. We watched old cop shows and ate peanuts in silence. During commercial breaks, that was when we’d talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you hear my brother’s getting married next weekend?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorted. “I’m not in the ground yet, boy. ’Course I heard. Everybody’s heard. She’s a sweet girl. Used to curtsy at me when she was little.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrinning, I said, “That’s because we told her you used to be a prince in Italy but then you became a mafioso.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Godfather of Cousins.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn straight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe show came back on, and we watched in comfort-able silence. Then, at the next break, Ernie said, “So are you gonna cry about it like a punk, or are you gonna do something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost choked on my peanut. Coughing, I said,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you talking about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made another snorty sound. “Don’t be coy with me. You love her, right? She’s the one?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ernie, I think you forgot to take your meds today,” I said. “Where’s your pillbox?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved me off with one bony white hand, his attention back on the TV. “Simmer down. Show’s back on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to wait until the next commercial until I asked him casually, “Do you really believe in that? That people are meant to be with one person?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShelling a nut, he said, “Sure I do. Elizabeth was my one. When she passed, I didn’t figure a reason to look for another one. My girl was gone. Now I’m just biding my time. Get me a beer, will you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood up and went to his fridge. I came back with a beer and a fresh glass. Ernie had a thing about a fresh glass. “What was John doing over here?” I asked. “I saw him on my way in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He came to mow my lawn.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought that was my job,” I said, pouring the beer into his glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You do a shit job of edging.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When did you guys even start speaking again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErnie shrugged and popped a peanut into his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s probably just sniffing around here so I leave him my property when I kick it.” He drank his beer and leaned back into his easy chair. “Eh, he’s a good kid. My sister’s only son. He’s family. Family’s family. Never forget that, Conrad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ernie, two commercial breaks ago, you told me that if I didn’t try and break up my brother’s wedding, I a punk!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePicking at his teeth, Ernie said, “If a girl’s the one, all bets are off, family or no family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt lighter when I left Ernie’s house a couple of hours later. I always did. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/we-ll-always-have-summer-summer-3/page-37.html","bookId":2725,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:15:44 PM"}
