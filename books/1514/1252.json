The majority of the past eight years had been spent out in the world. Now that such a rare chance had come for his family to be reunited, he naturally wanted to spend more time with them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHe was was aware that although the current situation seemed peaceful, countless undercurrents were flowing below the surface. The Yimo that had hidden themselves for hundreds and thousands of years were now gradually revealing themselves. No one could be certain of what they would do next. Lin Dong could faintly feel a slight sense of unease. This temporarily peace was perhaps was a precursor of the storm to come.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eIt was exactly because of this faint unease that Lin Dong grew increasingly reluctant to leave the atmosphere created from spending time with his family.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, what baffled Lin Dong was that Ling Qingzhu never once mentioned returning to the Nine Heavens Supreme Purity Palace in advance. Yet, because of how much Liu Yan was fond of Ling Qingzhu such that they chatted everyday, Lin Dong did not dare to speak of it. Since they seemed to like it, he would let them be.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis peace lasted for several days, when Lin Dong was suddenly called out by Lin Xiao from his leisurely life.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“You want me to go to the Great Desolate Province?

The Great Desolate Province was the first training ground he had gone to after leaving Qingyang Town. Back then, it was rather chaotic and numerous factions gathered there from all over. Of course, it was also home to the Great Wastelands Ancient Tablet and the ancient sect hidden within it where Lin Dong had obtained the Devouring Ancestral Symbol. Since he was heading to the Great Desolate Province, he intended to enter the Great Wastelands Ancient Tablet again. Everything had begun there, and it could be said that he owed that ancient sect a tremendous debt.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHe had taken many cursed Nirvana pills from that place back then, which were in the end cleansed of their curse with the help of the protector...\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Truth be told, there are two powerful factions in the current Great Yan Empire.

However, five years ago, this Eagle Martial Dojo suddenly rose up and unified the Great Desolate Province in a short span of a year. Moreover, from what we know, their faction even has influence in several surrounding empires. Their power is extremely astonishing.” Lin Xiao elaborated.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Eagle Martial Dojo?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThis familiar name caused Lin Dong to blink.

He clearly recalled that the Eagle Martial Dojo of the past was a rather small and weak faction in the Great Desolate Province.

Soon after, he nodded his head without hesitation. He owed a debt to that ancient sect within the Great Wastelands Ancient Tablet, and his Devouring Ancestral Symbol had also been obtained there. In addition the Great Desolate Imprisoning Heavenly Finger he had obtained back then had helped him through countless life or death situations.

Lin Dong was no longer the youngster that he needed to teach from back then.

He would be travelling alone this time. Although the Great Yan Empire was extensive, with Lin Dong’s speed, he had already reached the region where the Great Desolate Province was located in an hour.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eFrom the sky, Lin Dong lowered his head and looked down at the land as a look of tender recollection appeared in his eyes. Back then, he had walked out of Yan City and passed through numerous provinces before finally arriving at this Great Desolate Province.

As he neared his destination, he was somewhat shocked to see an enormous flag fluttering in the wind within several cities. On the flag was a soaring eagle. The stern and divine look within the eagle’s eyes made anyone who looked at it feel intimidated.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eEvidently, this was the flag of ‘Eagle Sect’. He just never expected that Eagle Sect would have such a solid control over the Great Desolate Province. It was likely that Eagle Sect was the true master of this Great Desolate Province, and even the royal family did not have any power here.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhile these thoughts passed through Lin Dong’s mind, his body had already travelled several thousand miles. Subsequently, he started to pay a little attention as he raised his head, only to see an enormous city towering on the ancient plains to his front. In the sky above the city, he could see countless figures flying past. Such a bustling scene did not lose out to the imperial city at all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLin Dong peered into the distance, only to see an incomparably huge stone tablet quietly standing at the center of the city.

Several breaths later, he had already appeared before the huge stone tablet.

Hence, there was extremely tight security around it. The guards did not seem to have noticed Lin Dong’s initially, but as he stood there while lost in thought, they finally regained their wits. Immediately, a sharp alarm rang out as countless figures surged over from all around and tightly surrounded Lin Dong in a manner that even water would be unable to pass through.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eWhile Lin Dong appeared before the Great Wastelands Ancient Tablet, a tall and slim woman in a light yellow dress stood on a certain tall building within the city. She possessed rather beautiful features, however she had the dignified look of one with high status.
