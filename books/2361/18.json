All the pieces were finally falling into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn orderly came into his office. \"Colonel Sostelo has arrived.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Show him in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won\u0027t be needing him anymore, Acoca thought. He can go back to his tin soldiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColonel Fal Sostelo walked in. \"Colonel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Colonel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s ironic, Sostelo thought. We hold the same rank, but the scarred giant has the power to break me. Because he\u0027s connected to the OPUS MUNDO.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an indignity for Sostelo to have to answer Acoca\u0027s summons as though he were some unimportant subordinate. But he managed to show none of his feelings. \"You wanted to see me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Acoca waved him to a chair. \"Sit down. I have some news for you. Jaime Miro has the nuns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. They\u0027re traveling with Miro and his men. He\u0027s split them up into three groups.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How - how do you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamon Acoca leaned back in his chair. \"Do you play chess?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pity. It\u0027s a very educational game. In order to be a good player, it\u0027s necessary to get into the mind of your opponent. Jaime Miro and I play chess with each other.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFal Sostelo was staring at him. \"I don\u0027t understand how - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not literally, Colonel. We don\u0027t use a chess board. We use our minds. I probably understand Jaime Miro better than anyone in the world. I know how his mind works. I knew that he would try to blow up the dam at Puente la Reina. We captured two of his lieutenants there, and it was only by luck that Miro himself got away. I knew that he would try to rescue them, and Miro knew that I knew it.\" Acoca shrugged. \"I didn\u0027t anticipate that he would use the bulls to effect their escape.\" There was a note of admiration in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sound as though you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Admire him? I admire his mind. I despise the man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know where Miro is headed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is traveling north. I will catch him within the next three days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColonel Sostelo was gaping at him, stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It will finally be checkmate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was true that Colonel Acoca understood Jaime Miro, and the way his mind worked, but it was not enough for him. The colonel wanted an edge, to ensure victory, and he had found it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of Miro\u0027s terrorists,\" Colonel Acoca said, \"is an informant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubio, Tomas, and the two sisters avoided the large cities and took side roads, passing old stone villages with grazing sheep and goats, and shepherds listening to music and soccer games on their transistor radios. It was a colorful juxtaposition of the past and the present, but Lucia had other things on her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stayed close to Sister Teresa, waiting for the first opportunity to get the cross and leave. The two men were always at their side. Rubio Arzano was the more considerate of the two, a tall, pleasant-looking, cheerful man. A simple-minded peasant, Lucia decided. Tomas Sanjuro was slight and balding. He looks more like a shoe clerk than a terrorist It will be easy to outwit them both.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked across the plains north of avila by night, cooled by the winds blowing down from the Guadarrama mountains. There was a haunting emptiness about the plains by moonlight. They passed granjas of wheat, olive trees, grapevines, and maize, and they foraged for potatoes and lettuce, fruit from the trees, and eggs and chickens from the hen coops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The whole countryside of Spain is a huge market,\" said Rubio Arzano.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomas Sanjuro grinned. \"And it\u0027s all for free.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Teresa was totally oblivious to her surroundings. Her only thought was to reach the convent at Mendavia. The cross was getting heavy, but she was determined not to let it out of her hands. Soon, she thought. We\u0027ll be there soon. We\u0027re fleeing from Gethsemane and our enemies to the new mansion He has prepared for us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia said, \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Teresa was unaware that she had spoken aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - nothing,\" she mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia took a closer look at her. The older woman seemed distracted and vaguely disoriented, unaware of what was happening around her. She nodded toward the canvas package that Sister Teresa carried. \"That must be heavy,\" Lucia said sympathetically. \"Wouldn\u0027t you like me to carry it for a while?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Teresa clutched it to her body more tightly. \"Jesus carried a heavier burden. I can carry this for Him. Does it not say in Luke: \u0027If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me\u0027? I\u0027ll carry it,\" she said stubbornly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something odd in her tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right, Sister?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Teresa was far from all right. She had not been able to sleep. She felt dizzy and feverish. Her mind was playing tricks again. I mustn\u0027t let myself become ill, she thought. Sister Betina will scold me. But Sister Betina was not there. It was so confusing. And who were these men? I don\u0027t trust them. What do they want with me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubio Arzano had attempted to strike up a conversation with Sister Teresa, trying to make her feel at ease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It must seem strange to you, being out in the world again, Sister. How long were you in the convent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did he want to know? \"Thirty years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My, that\u0027s a long time. Where are you from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was painful for her even to say the word. \"eze.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face brightened. \"eze? I spent a summer there once on a holiday. It\u0027s a lovely town. I know it well. I remember...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know it well. How well? Does he know Raoul? Did Raoul send him here? And the truth hit her like a bolt of lightning. These strangers had been sent to bring her back to eze, to Raoul Giradot. They were kidnapping her. God was punishing her for deserting Monique\u0027s baby. She was certain now that the baby she had seen in the village square in Villacastin was her sister\u0027s. \"But it couldn\u0027t have been, could it? That was thirty years ago,\" Teresa muttered to herself. \"They\u0027re lying to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubio Arzano was watching her, listening to her mumbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is something wrong, Sister?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Teresa shrank away from him. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was onto them now. She was not going to let them take her back to Raoul and the baby. She had to get to the convent at Mendavia and hand over the gold crucifix, and then God would forgive her for the terrible sin she had committed. I must be clever. I must not let them know I am onto their secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at Rubio. \"I am fine,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving on across the dry, sunbaked plains, they came to a small village where peasant women dressed in black were doing their wash at a spring covered by a roof resting on four ancient beams. The water poured into a long wooden trough and out again, so that it was always fresh, and the women scrubbed their wash on stone slabs and rinsed it clean in the running water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s such a peaceful scene, Rubio thought. It reminded him of the farm he had left behind. It\u0027s what Spain used to be like. No bombs, no killing. Will we ever know peace again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buenos dias.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buenos dias.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder if we might have a drink? Traveling is thirsty work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly. Please help yourselves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe water was cold and refreshing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gracias. Adios.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adios.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubio hated to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two women and their escorts moved on, past cork and olive trees, the summer air filled with the smells of ripe grapes and oranges. They went by orchards of apple, cherry, and plum trees, and farms noisy with the sounds of chickens, pigs, and goats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubio and Tomas walked ahead, talking quietly together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey are talking about me. They think I do not know their plan. Sister Teresa moved nearer to them so she could hear what they were saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"...a reward of five hundred thousand pesetas on our heads. Of course Colonel Acoca would pay more for Jaime, but he doesn\u0027t want his head. He wants his cojones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe men laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Sister Teresa listened to them talk, her conviction grew stronger. These men are killers doing Satan\u0027s work, messengers of the devil sent to damn me to everlasting hell But God is stronger than they are. He will not let them take me back home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaoul Giradot was at her side, smiling the smile that she knew so well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI beg your pardon?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard you sing yesterday. You are magnificent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMay I help you?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would like three yards of muslin, please.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCertainly. This way...My aunt owns this shop and she needed help, so I thought I\u0027d work for her for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sure you could have any man you want, Teresa, but I hope you will choose me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked so handsome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have never known anyone like you, my darling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaoul took her in his arms and was kissing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027re going to make a beautiful bride\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now I\u0027m Christ\u0027s bride. I can\u0027t return to Raoul\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucia was watching Sister Teresa closely. She was talking to herself, but Lucia could not make out the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s cracking up, Lucia thought. She\u0027s not going to make it I\u0027ve got to get hold of that cross soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was dusk when they saw the town of Olmedo in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubio stopped. \"There will be soldiers there. Let\u0027s move up to the hills and skirt the city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey moved off the road and left the plains, heading for the hills above Olmedo. The sun was skipping across the mountaintops and the sky was beginning to darken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve only a few more miles to go,\" Rubio Arzano said reassuringly. \"Then we can rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had reached the top of a high ridge when Tomas Sanjuro suddenly held up a hand. \"Hold it,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubio walked over to his side and together they moved to the edge of the ridge and looked down into the valley below. There was an encampment of soldiers there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0026amp;iexcl;Mierda!\" Rubio whispered. \"There must be a whole platoon. We\u0027ll stay up here for the rest of the night. They\u0027ll probably pull out in the morning and we can move on.\" He turned to Lucia and Sister Teresa, trying not to show how worried he was. \"We\u0027ll spend the night here, Sisters. We must be very quiet. There are soldiers down there and we don\u0027t want them to find us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the best news Lucia could have heard. It\u0027s perfect, she thought. I\u0027ll disappear with the cross during the night They won\u0027t dare try to follow me because of the soldiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo Sister Teresa, the news had a different meaning. She had heard the men say that someone named Colonel Acoca was searching for them. They called Colonel Acoca the enemy. But these men are the enemy, so Colonel Acoca must be my friend. Thank You, dear God, for sending me Colonel Acoca.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tall man called Rubio was speaking to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you understand, Sister? We must all be very, very quiet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I understand.\" I understand more than you think. They had no idea that God permitted her to see into their evil hearts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomas Sanjuro said kindly, \"I know how difficult this must be for both of you, but don\u0027t worry. We\u0027ll see that you get safely to the convent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo eze, he means. Oh, but he is cunning. He speaks the honeyed words of the devil But God is within me, and He is guiding me. She knew what she must do. But she had to be careful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two men arranged the sleeping bags for the women, next to each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Both of you get some sleep now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe women got into the unfamiliar sleeping bags. The night was incredibly clear and the sky was spangled with glimmering stars. Lucia looked up at them and thought happily: In just a few hours now, I\u0027ll be on my way to freedom. As soon as they\u0027re all asleep. She yawned. She had not realized how tired she was. The long, hard journey and the emotional strain had taken their toll. Her eyes felt heavy. I\u0027ll just rest for a little while, Lucia thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Teresa lay near Lucia, wide awake, fighting the demons that were trying to possess her, to send her soul to hell. I must be strong. The Lord is testing me. I have been exiled so that I can find my way back to Him. And these men are trying to stop me I must not let them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt four o\u0027clock in the morning, Sister Teresa silently sat up and looked around. Tomas Sanjuro was asleep only a few feet from her. The tall, dark man called Rubio was keeping watch at the edge of the clearing, his back to her. She could see his silhouette against the trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery quietly, Sister Teresa rose. She hesitated, thinking about the cross. Should I carry it with me? But I\u0027ll be coming back here very soon. I must find a place where it will be safe until I return. She looked over to where Sister Lucia lay sleeping. Yes. It will be safe with my sister in God, Sister Teresa decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilently she moved over to Lucia\u0027s sleeping bag and gently slipped the wrapped cross inside. Lucia did not stir. Sister Teresa turned and moved into the woods, out of Rubio Arzano\u0027s sight, and carefully began to make her way downhill toward the soldiers\u0027 camp. The hill was steep and slippery with dew, but God gave her wings and she sped downhill without stumbling or falling, hurrying toward her salvation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the darkness ahead, the figure of a man suddenly materialized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA voice called out, \"Who goes there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sister Teresa.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe approached the sentry, who was wearing an army uniform and pointing a rifle at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you come from, old woman?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him with glowing eyes. \"God sent me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sentry stared at her. \"Did He, now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. He sent me to see Colonel Acoca.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard shook his head. \"You\u0027d better tell Him you\u0027re not the colonel\u0027s type. Adios, senora.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t understand. I am Sister Teresa from the Cistercian convent. I have been taken prisoner by Jaime Miro and his men.\" She watched the stunned expression that came over his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re - you\u0027re from the convent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The one at avila?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Teresa said impatiently. What was the matter with the man? Didn\u0027t he realize how important it was that she be rescued from those evil men?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldier said carefully, \"The colonel isn\u0027t here just now, Sister - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an unexpected blow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" - but Colonel Sostelo is in charge. I can take you to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will he be able to help me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I\u0027m sure he will. Follow me, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sentry was scarcely able to believe his good fortune. Colonel Fal Sostelo had sent squadrons of soldiers to scour the entire countryside in search of the four nuns, and they had had no success. Now one of the sisters had stumbled into the camp and given herself up to him. The colonel was going to be very pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reached the tent where Colonel Fal Sostelo and his second-in-command were poring over a map. The men looked up as the sentry and a woman entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me, Colonel. This is Sister Teresa from the Cistercian convent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColonel Sostelo stared at her unbelievingly. For the last three days, all of his energy had been focused on finding Jaime Miro and the nuns, and now, here in front of him, was one of them. There was a God.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down, Sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is no time for that, Sister Teresa thought. She had to make him realize how urgent this was. \"We must hurry. They are trying to take me back to eze.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe colonel was puzzled. \"Who\u0027s trying to take you back to eze?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The men of Jaime Miro.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got to his feet. \"Sister - do you by any chance happen to know where these men are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSister Teresa said impatiently, \"Of course.\" She turned and pointed. \"They\u0027re up in those hills hiding from you.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sands-of-time/page-18.html","bookId":2361,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:56 AM"}
