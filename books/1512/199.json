Charge faster!” Then he swung the knife along the side of the bus, cutting off the arm of a zombie. The others behind him also started shooting the zombies. The explosion came in time to allow the bus moving forward. The number of zombies reduced substantially after they entered the explosion area.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, Heng’s eyes went out of focus. The Focused State of Mind removed his fear of this bloodshed. Lan connected him to the Soul Link along with Zheng and Yinkong, so his accuracy reached almost a hundred percent. When the first Lickerjumped at them, he had already readied his arrow. As soon as the Licker landed, it turned into dust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice and the movie characters looked at that bow with their eyes wide open in disbelief. They didn’t even see a trace of the arrow. The shot was like a laser. It’s power, speed, and accuracy shocked the movie characters. They had seen Heng carrying a longbow, but no one knew its strength until now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everyone stand firm!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng had no time to care about the others. He stared ahead as countless zombies came into view again. This city should have at least 200 thousand people. If even half of these people turned into zombies, then it would be over 100 thousand. There were at least ten thousand zombies surrounding them right now. Not just zombies but also Lickers, hounds, and mutated ones with tentacles all over. If the bus stopped here, there was no chance for them to live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng clenched his teeth. He took out another grenade and threw it out. This road was only a few kilometers long but the bus was already covered in rotten flesh. The group was also feeling exhausted, but the zombies around them had gotten less.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng let out a sigh of relief and yelled. “Check your weapons and ammunitions. I still have a lot of bullets here. Heng, how many arrows do you have left? Anyone wounded?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey reported their ammunitions. Zheng’s bullets could only be used on Alice and the players’ guns. Carlos had two magazines left but his close combat was good enough even if he ran out of bullets. Heng had sixty-four arrows left. Honglu spent one of his staffs. The two newbies, the woman, and LJ were frightened. Their faces looked pale white. In contrast, Angela remained in her seat quietly the whole time, as if she didn’t feel the danger coming from the zombies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill shared the pack of cigarette that Zheng gave her during the break. She took a deep smoke then said. “This is horrifying. If the virus spreads outside the city, humanity might be wiped out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice also took a smoke. “Not simply horrifying. I don’t know what caused the virus to start evolving. Had you noticed that there’s a zombie in the pack hunting other zombies? It’s are full of tentacles the thickness of an arm and it absorbed other zombies into its bodies and grew larger every time. I saw it in the pack. I don’t know how the virus is going to end up. Hope we don’t become food for those tentacles.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng said. “No matter what, surviving is the most important thing for us now. They should have entered the city center by now. Don’t know if they also get attacked by the countless zombies.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside a parking lot northwest of the group. A coach lit up and drove out of the gate. The driver was shouting until several people behind him scolded him and he stopped. His body was moving like he was following a rhythm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone’s mind was connected with the two psyche force users. They were surprised to see a large pack of zombies and a special large zombie through the psyche scan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClone Zheng sneered. “God’s stupid trick. Trying to stop us with these zombies and increase the danger. Pathetic. Wait here for a bit.” He kicked open the window and flipped up to the top of the coach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClone Zheng gestured with his hands. A pair of bones suddenly grew out from his back. The bones grew longer and longer then opened up into a pair of black webbed wings. Its skin was pure black. The blood vessels and bones were faintly visible under the skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave a cold laugh and jumped off the coach then sprinted ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time the coach caught up to him, clone Zheng was holding onto a broadsword covered in a dark flame. The area in front of him had sear marks all over. Pieces of zombies were still burning. Many Lickers and large tentacle zombies were slashed into pieces. Clone Zheng was the only person still in one piece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It wasn’t too many zombies but there were several mutated ones. It’s probably God’s way to limit us by using stronger forces.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClone Zheng flapped his wings and flew to the top of the car. He sat down and said. “Go, chase up to them and kill them all!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, Zheng also encountered the large tentacle zombies. These zombies were like octopuses. Their tentacles had a sucking force. It could suck in both flesh and bones on contact. They saw a zombie just disappeared like that. Every time they absorbed a zombie, the tentacle zombie would grow larger. The one in front was three meters tall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt jumped out from the top of a building. When Heng noticed it, the tentacle zombie was already on top of the bus and he couldn’t aim at it. The others kept firing with their gun at it. Then a tentacle came through the window and sucked onto JiangZhe’s arm. The tentacle pulled him to the window before he could even scream, and half his arm was already gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng was keeping an eye on everyone through the psyche scan. When JiangZhe was being pulled, he ran over and slashed his knife. Yet, the tentacle was already out the window so he cut off the arm. Blood splashed from the wound and JiangZhe fell backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Heng, aim through the scan. Hurry and shoot!” Zheng yelled because he saw the tentacles waving around the bus, preparing to strike them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeng pulled his bow as soon as Zheng yelled. An arrow shot right through the top of the bus then all the tentacles reaching for the inside withered. The tentacle zombie’s main body disintegrated and the tentacles fell to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be careful! Heng, just shoot, don’t worry about conserving the arrows anymore. Just save twenty, no, ten arrows! Shoot!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng yelled and grabbed the top of the bus. He pulled himself up. To his surprise, Yinkong also flipped up to the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTentacle zombies started coming from both sides of the street. Some of them reached the bus and some dropped to the top of the bus. Yinkong’s attack with the memory wire was impressive. She separated an tentacle zombie into several pieces with a whip then the wire went for another one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng was delighted to see it. He held onto the knife with his right hand and took out the Book of the Dead with his left. He read the ancient Egyptian out. When the next wave of zombies came, several large rocks spiked up from the ground and pierced the zombies. The bus took the chance to drive away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv style\u003d\"clear: both\"\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-10-chapter-6-02\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-10-chapter-7-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-10-chapter-6-3","bookId":1512,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM"}
