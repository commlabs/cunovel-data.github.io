I shall imagine Tehol sitting here, to help me along. Conquest. There are different kinds of conquests. Now, we have Tiste Edur lording it here and there, the elite whose word is law and never questioned. After all, their sorcery is cruel, their judgement cold and terribly simplistic. They are, in fact, above all law-as the Letherii understand the notion-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And,’ Lostara pressed, ‘how do they understand the notion of law?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Well, a set of deliberately vague guidelines one hires an advocate to evade when necessary.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What were you, Shurq Elalle, before you were a pirate?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thief. I’ve employed a few advocates in my day. In any case, my point is this. The Edur rule but either through ignorance or indifference-and let’s face it, without ignorance you don’t get to indifference-they care little about the everyday administration of the empire. So, that particular apparatus remains Letherii and is, these days, even less regulated than it has been in the past.’ She smiled again, one leg rocking. As for us lower orders, well, virtually nothing has changed. We stay poor. Debt-ridden and comfortably miserable and, as Tehol might say, miserable in our comfort.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So,’ Lostara said, ‘not even the Letherii nobles would welcome a change in the present order.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Them least of all.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What of your Emperor?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Rhulad? From all accounts, he is insane, and effectively isolated besides. The empire is ruled by the Chancellor, and lie’s Letherii.

We sent them in, expecting to find allies, expecting them to whip the countryside into a belligerent frenzy.

Chancellor Triban Gnol, who wounds children and calls it love?’ He looked at her then, unwilling to admit, even to himself, the effort that gesture demanded of him. ‘Shall I break his neck for you, wife? Easier than snapping a dead branch. What do you think his bodyguards will do?
