It did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what\u0027s the matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" Connor said. \"I was just thinking about what he actually said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He mentioned Fairchild.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" Connor said. \"Morton knows the real story about Fairchild, very well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to ask him what it was, but he was already telling me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever heard of Seymour Cray? For years, he was the best designer of supercomputers in the world. Cray Research made the fastest computers in the world. The Japanese were trying to catch up with him, but they just couldn\u0027t do it. He was too brilliant. But by the mid-eighties, Japanese chip dumping had put most of Cray\u0027s domestic suppliers out of business. So Cray had to order his custom-designed chips from Japanese manufacturers. There was nobody in America to make them. And his Japanese suppliers experienced mysterious delays. At one point, it took them a year to deliver certain chips he had ordered - and during that time, his Japanese competitors made great strides forward. There was also a question of whether they had stolen his new technology. Cray was furious. He knew they were fucking with him. He decided that he had to form a liaison with an American manufacturer, and so he chose Fairchild Semiconductor, even though the company was financially weak, far from the best. But Cray couldn\u0027t trust the Japanese anymore. He had to make do with Fairchild. So now Fairchild was making his next generation of custom chips for him - and then he learned that Fairchild was going to be sold to Fujitsu. His big competitor. It was concern about situations like that, and the national security implications, that led Congress to block the sale to Fujitsu.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, blocking the sale didn\u0027t solve Fairchild\u0027s financial problems. The company was still in trouble. And it eventually had to be sold. There was a rumor it was going to be bought by Bull, a French company that didn\u0027t compete in supercomputers. That sale might have been permitted by Congress. But in the end, Fairchild was sold to an American company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And MicroCon is another Fairchild?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, in the sense that MicroCon will give the Japanese a monopoly on vital chip-making machinery. Once they have a monopoly, they can withhold the machines from American companies. But now I think - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was when the phone rang. I left it on the speakerphone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Lauren. My ex-wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Hello, Lauren.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peter, I am calling to inform you that I\u0027m going to pick up Michelle early today.\" Her voice sounded tense, formal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are? I didn\u0027t know you were picking her up at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never said that, Peter,\" she answered quickly. \"Of course I\u0027m picking her up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Okay, fine. By the way, who\u0027s Rick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a pause. \"Really. That is beneath you, Peter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I said. \"I\u0027m just curious. Michelle mentioned it this morning. She said he has a black Mercedes. Is he the new boyfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peter. I hardly think that is on the same level.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"The same level as what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s not play games,\" she said. \"This is difficult enough. I\u0027m calling to tell you I have to pick up Michelle early because I\u0027m taking her to the doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? She\u0027s over her cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m taking her for an examination, Peter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An examination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard you,\" I said. \"But - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The physician who will examine her is Robert Strauss. He is an expert, I\u0027m told. I have been asking people in the office who is the best person. I don\u0027t know how this is going to turn out, Peter, but I want you to know I am concerned, particularly in the light of your history.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lauren, what are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m talking about child abuse,\" she said. \"I\u0027m talking about sexual molestation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no getting around it, at this point. You know you\u0027ve been accused of it in the past.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt churning nausea. Whenever a relationship goes sour, there\u0027s always some residue of resentment, some pockets of bitterness and anger - as well as lots of private things that you know about the other person, that you can use against them. If you choose to do that. Lauren never had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lauren, you know that abuse charge was trumped up, You know everything about that. We were married at the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I only know what you told me.\" Her voice sounded distant now, moralistic, a little sarcastic. Her prosecutor\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lauren, for Christ\u0027s sake. This is ridiculous. What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is not ridiculous. I have my responsibilities as a mother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, for God\u0027s sake, you\u0027ve never been particularly worried about your responsibilities as a mother before. And now you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true that I have a demanding career,\" she said, in an icy tone, \"but there has never been any question that my daughter comes first. And I deeply, deeply regret if my past behavior in any way contributed to this unpleasant circumstance now.\" I had the feeling that she wasn\u0027t talking to me. She was rehearsing. Trying out the words to see how they would sound before a judge. \"Clearly, Peter, if there is child abuse, Michelle cannot continue to live with you. Or even to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt pain in my chest. A wrenching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about? Who told you there was child abuse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peter, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s appropriate for me to comment at this point in time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was it Wilhelm? Who called you, Lauren?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Peter, there\u0027s no point in going into this, I\u0027m officially notifying you that I\u0027m going to pick Michelle up at four p.m. I want her ready to go at four this afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lauren - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have my secretary, Miss Wilson, listening on the line and making stenographic notes of our conversation. I\u0027m giving you formal notice of my intention to pick up my daughter and take her for a physical examination. Do you have any questions about my decision?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Four o\u0027clock, then. Thank you for your cooperation. And let me add on a personal note, Peter, I\u0027m truly sorry that it has come to this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she hung up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had been involved in sex abuse cases when I was a detective. I knew how it worked. The fact is, you usually can\u0027t determine anything from a physical exam. It\u0027s always equivocal. And if a kid is questioned by a psychologist who hammers her with questions, the kid will eventually start to go along, and make up answers to please the psychologist. Normal procedure requires the psychologist to videotape the kids, to prove that the questioning wasn\u0027t leading. But the situation is almost always unclear when it finally comes before a judge. And the judge must therefore rule conservatively. Which means, if there is a possibility of abuse, to keep the child away from the accused parent. Or at least, not allow unsupervised visitation. No overnight visits. Or perhaps not even -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s enough,\" Connor said, sitting beside me in the car. \"Come back now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" I said. \"But it\u0027s upsetting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure. Now: what haven\u0027t you told me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The molestation charge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. There\u0027s nothing to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kōhai,\" he said quietly. \"I can\u0027t help you if you won\u0027t tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It had nothing to do with sexual molestation,\" I said, \"It was something else entirely. It was about money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnor said nothing. He just waited. Looking at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, hell,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou have these times in your life when you believe you know what you\u0027re doing, but you really don\u0027t. Later on, you can look back, and you see you weren\u0027t acting right at all. You drifted into something, and you were completely screwed up. But at the time, you thought everything was fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat happened to me was, I was in love. Lauren was one of those patrician-acting girls, lean and graceful and understated. She looked like she grew up with horses. And she was younger than me, and beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI always knew it wouldn\u0027t work between us, but I was trying to make it work anyway. We had gotten married and had begun living together and she was starting to be dissatisfied. Dissatisfied with my apartment, where it was located, how much money we had. All of that. She was throwing up, which didn\u0027t help. She had crackers in the car, crackers by the bed, crackers everywhere. She was so miserable and so unhappy that I tried to please her in little ways. Get her things. Bring her things. Cook her meals. Do little domestic things. It wasn\u0027t my usual way, but I was in love. I was drifting into this habit of pleasing her. Trying to please her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was constant pressure. More this, more that. More money. More, more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe also had a specific problem. Her health insurance through the D.A.\u0027s office didn\u0027t cover pregnancy and neither did mine. After we got married, we couldn\u0027t get coverage in time to pay for the baby. It was going to cost eight thousand dollars and we had to come up with it. Neither of us had the money. Lauren\u0027s father was a doctor in Virginia but she didn\u0027t want to ask him for the money because he disapproved of her marrying me in the first place. My family doesn\u0027t have any money. So. There wasn\u0027t any money. She worked for the D.A. I worked for the department. She had a lot of debts on her MasterCard and owed money on her car. We had to come up with eight thousand dollars. It\u0027s hanging over our heads. How we are going to do this. And it gets to be an unspoken thing, at least from her. That I should handle it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo one night in August I\u0027m out on a domestic violence call in Ladera Heights. Hispanic couple. They\u0027ve been drinking and going at it pretty good, she\u0027s got a split lip and he\u0027s got a black eye, and their kid\u0027s screaming in the next room, but pretty soon we calm them down and we can see that nobody is seriously injured, so we\u0027re about to leave. And the wife sees we\u0027re about to leave. At that point she starts yelling that the husband has been fooling with the daughter. Physically abusing the daughter. When the husband hears this, he looks really pissed, and I think it\u0027s bullshit, the wife is just doing something to harass him. But the wife insists we check the daughter, so I go into the kid\u0027s room and the kid is about nine months old and screaming red in the face, and I pull the covers back to check for bruises and there I see a kilo of white brick. Under the covers with the kid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know, it\u0027s one of those situations, they\u0027re married so she\u0027d have to testify against her husband, there\u0027s no probable cause, the search is invalid, on and on. If he\u0027s got a halfway decent lawyer he can beat this, no problem. So I go out and call the guy in. I know I can\u0027t do anything. All I\u0027m thinking is that if his kid ever got this brick in her mouth, chewed on it, it would kill her. I want to talk to him about that. I figure I\u0027ll fuck him over a little. Scare him a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now it\u0027s him and me in the kid\u0027s room. The wife is still out in the living room with my partner, and suddenly the guy pulls out an envelope two centimeters thick. He cracks it open. I see hundred-dollar bills. An inch thick of hundred-dollar bills. And he says, \"Thanks for your help, officer.\" There\u0027s got to be ten thousand dollars in that envelope. Maybe more. I don\u0027t know. The guy holds out the envelope and looks at me. Expecting me to take it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI say something lame about how it\u0027s dangerous to hide shit in a kid\u0027s bed. Right away, the guy picks up the brick, puts it on the floor, kicks it out of sight under the bed. Then he says, \"You are right. Thank you, officer. I would hate something happens to my daughter.\" And he holds out the envelope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything is in turmoil. The wife is outside screaming at my partner. The kid is in here screaming at us. The guy is holding the envelope. He smiles and nods. Like, go ahead and take it. It\u0027s yours. And I think... I don\u0027t know what I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext thing I know, I\u0027m out in the living room and I say everything is fine with the kid, and now the woman starts to scream in her drunken way that I abused her child - now it\u0027s me, not the husband - and that I am in a conspiracy with the husband, that we are both child abusers. My partner figures she\u0027s crazy drunk and we leave, and that\u0027s it. My partner says, \"You were in that room a while.\" And I say, \"I had to check the kid,\" And that\u0027s it. Except the next day she comes in and makes a formal complaint that I abused her child. She\u0027s hung over and she has a record, but even so it\u0027s a serious charge and it goes through the system as far as the preliminary, where it gets thrown out as entirely without merit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s what happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s the whole story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the money?\" Connor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I went to Vegas for the weekend. I won big. I paid taxes on thirteen thousand in unearned income that year.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whose idea was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lauren. She told me how to handle it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So she knows what happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the department investigation? Did the preliminary board issue a report?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think it got that far. They just heard it orally and dismissed it. There\u0027s probably a notation in the file, but not an actual report.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" Connor said. \"Now tell me the rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I told him about Ken Shubik, and the Times, and the Weasel. Connor listened silently, frowning. As I talked, he began to suck air through his teeth, which was the Japanese way of expressing disapproval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kōhai,\" he said, when I finished, \"you are making my life extremely difficult. And certainly you make me appear foolish when I should not. Why didn\u0027t you tell me this earlier?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it has nothing to do with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kōhai.\" He was shaking his head. \"Kōhai...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was thinking about my daughter again. About the possibility - just the possibility - that I would not be able to see her - that I would not be able to -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" Connor said, \"I told you it could be unpleasant, Take my word for it. It can get much more unpleasant than this. This is only the beginning. It can get nasty. We must proceed quickly and try to wrap everything up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought everything was wrapped up.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rising-sun/page-31.html","bookId":2407,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:45 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:32:45 AM"}
