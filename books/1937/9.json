She needed a reason to laugh. Her day had started early when she opened Barbie’s, her dress shop, two blocks off Blossom Street. The shop was high-end, exclusive and very expensive. Her clientele were women who could easily afford to drop four figures on a dress. Barbie made sure they got their money’s worth, providing advice, accessories and free alterations. She had a number of regular customers who counted on her for their entire wardrobes. Her own sense of style had served her well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t want to sound conceited, but Barbie was aware that she was an attractive woman. Since Gary’s death, she’d received no shortage of attention from the opposite sex. Men wanted a woman like her on their arm—and, she suspected, they wanted her money. Barbie, however, wasn’t easily swayed by flattery. She’d been happy in her marriage and had loved her husband. At this point in her life she wasn’t willing to settle for mere companionship or, heaven forbid, no-strings sex. She wanted love. She longed for a man who’d treat her like a princess the way Gary had. Her friends told her that was a dated attitude; Barbie didn’t care. Unfortunately there weren’t many princes around these days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d married young. In retrospect she recognized how fortunate she’d been in finding Gary. She’d had no real life experience, so the fact that she’d met a really wonderful man and fallen in love with him was pure luck. He was ten years her senior; at thirty, he’d had a wisdom beyond his years and a great capacity for love, for loyalty. He’d been working for her father at the time and came to the house often. She’d had a crush on him that developed into genuine love, although it took her a few years to recognize just how genuine it was. At nineteen, she always made sure she happened to be around whenever he stopped by, and enjoyed parading through the house to the pool—in her bikini, of course. She still smiled at the way Gary had looked in every direction except hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d married when she was twenty-one, with her father’s blessing and, surprisingly perhaps, her mother’s. She got pregnant the first week of their honeymoon. When she’d delivered identical twin sons, Gary had been over the moon. The pregnancy had been difficult, however, and he’d insisted the two boys were family enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe twins, Eric and Kurt, filled their lives and they were idyllically happy. Not that she and Gary didn’t have their share of differences and arguments, but they forgave each other quickly and never confused disagreement with anger. Their household had been calm, orderly, contented. The plane crash ended all that. Barbie had always been close to her sons, but following the tragic deaths, of Gary and her father, the three of them were closer than ever. They helped one another through their grief, and even now they talked almost every day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEncouraged by her mother and sons, a year after Gary’s death Barbie started her own business. The dress shop helped take her mind off her loneliness and gave her purpose. Her sons were eighteen and growing increasingly independent. They’d be on their own soon. As it happened, they were attending colleges on the opposite side of the country. Swallowing her natural instinct to hold on to her children, she flew out to Boston and New York with her sons, got them settled in their respective schools and then flew home. She’d wept like a baby throughout the entire five-hour flight back to the West Coast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer house seemed so empty without the boys—her house and her life. She’d never felt more alone than she had since last September when she’d accompanied Kurt and Eric to their East Coast schools. Thankfully, though, they’d both come home for Thanksgiving and Christmas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d kept herself occupied with the shop, but the Valentine’s get-together with the other widows had revealed a different kind of opportunity. Barbie had begun to compose her list of Twenty Wishes, hoping to discover a new objective, some new goal to pursue. Her mother had leaped at this idea with an enthusiasm she hadn’t shown in years, and if for no other reason, Barbie had followed suit. They often did things together and, in fact, her mother was Barbie’s best friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe line moved. Barbie approached the teenage cashier and handed her a ten-dollar bill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Which movie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarbie smiled at her. “You decide. Preferably a comedy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl searched her face. “There are three or four showing. You don’t care which one?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not really.” All Barbie wanted to do was escape reality for the next two hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe teenager took her money and a single ticket shot up, which she gave Barbie, along with her change. “Theater number twelve,” she instructed. “The movie starts at four twenty-five.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough she wasn’t hungry, the instant Barbie stepped into the lobby, the scent of popcorn made her mouth water. She purchased a small bag and a soft drink, then headed for theater number twelve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe previews were underway, and Barbie quickly located a seat in a middle row. She settled down with her popcorn and drink, dropping her purse in the empty seat beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlancing about, Barbie saw nothing but couples, most of them older and presumably retired. She nibbled on her popcorn and all at once her throat went dry. The entire world seemed to be made up of people in love. She envied the other women in the audience their long-lasting relationships, their forever loves, which was what she and Gary should have had. She wanted another chance. She was attractive, well off, a nice person—and alone. Falling in love again was first on her list of wishes. But she didn’t want another relationship unless she could find a man like Gary and there didn’t seem to be many of those.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil the other widows had started talking about those stupid wishes, Barbie’s life had seemed to be trudging along satisfactorily enough. Her mother’s list was nearly complete. Not Barbie’s. She’d written down a few things besides falling in love. She wanted to learn how to belly dance. She and Gary had seen a belly dance performance during a brief stopover in Cairo years before and she’d been intrigued by the sensuous, feminine movements. She’d listed something else, too. She wanted to go snorkeling in Hawaii and shopping in Paris and sightseeing in London—all of which she’d done with Gary and enjoyed. But she didn’t want to do them alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the moment, her desire to fall in love again seemed an illusion beyond her grasp. But she wasn’t exactly looking for a relationship. If she truly wanted to love and be loved, she had to be receptive to love, open to it, willing to risk the pain of loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head, telling herself there was no point in believing that a man might one day love her the way Gary had. Love her. Not her money, not her beauty. Her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of a sudden tears welled in her eyes and she dashed them angrily away. She didn’t have a thing to cry about. Not a single, solitary thing. Dozens of women, hundreds of them, would envy her life. She had no money problems, her children were responsible adults, and at forty she didn’t look a day over thirty. The tears made no sense whatsoever, and yet there was no denying them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReaching for her purse, Barbie pulled out a pack of tissues, grabbed one and loudly blew her nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe previews for upcoming features were still flashing across the screen. They were apparently comedies because the audience found the clips amusing. Sporadic laughter broke out around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSniffling and dabbing her eyes, she noticed a man in a wheelchair approaching the row. He was staring at her, which wasn’t uncommon. Men liked to look at her. Only it wasn’t appreciation or approval she saw in his gaze. Instead, he seemed to be regarding her with irritation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManeuvering his chair into the empty space beside Barbie, he turned to glare at her. “In case you weren’t aware of it, you’re sitting in the row reserved for people with wheelchairs and their companions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.” Barbie hadn’t realized that, although now he’d mentioned it, she saw the row was clearly marked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll need to leave.” His words lacked any hint of friendliness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe must have someone with him and wanted the seat for that person. No wonder he frowned at her as if she’d trespassed on his personal property.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRetrieving her large purse, she draped it over her shoulder, grabbed her popcorn and soft drink and stood. Instead of walking all the way through the empty row, she tried to get past him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an effort to give her the necessary room, he started to roll back his wheelchair and somehow caught the hem of her pants. Barbie stumbled and in the process of righting herself, dumped the entire contents of her soft drink in his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man gasped at the shock as the soda drenched his pants and ice cubes slid to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I am so sorry.” Barbie plunged her hand in her purse for the tissue packet and managed to spill her popcorn on him as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I…I couldn’t be sorrier,” she muttered, more embarrassed than she’d ever felt before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you kindly just leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed in the direction he wanted her to go, then shook his head in disgust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarbie couldn’t get out of the row fast enough. Feeling like a clumsy fool, she rushed into the empty lobby. She yanked a handful of napkins from the dispenser and hurriedly returned to the theater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man was still brushing popcorn off his lap when she offered him the napkins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I get you anything else?” she asked in a loud whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis intense blue eyes glared back at her. “I think you’ve already done enough. The best thing you could do is leave me alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t need to be so rude. “I said I was sorry,” she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine. Apology accepted. Now if it’s possible, I’d like to enjoy the movie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBarbie gritted her teeth. She felt like dumping another soft drink on his head. It wasn’t as if she’d purposely spilled the soda. It’d been an accident and she’d apologized repeatedly. She felt her regret turn into annoyance at his ungracious reaction. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twenty-wishes-blossom-street-5/page-9.html","bookId":1937,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:06 AM"}
