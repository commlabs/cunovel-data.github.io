I called Rush. I called the Imposter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To warn him. Dewey kept saying that he was going to kill him or have him killed because of Saranne. I couldn’t let that happen. I didn’t care about Rush, but Dewey and I have been friends for a long time, and I didn’t want to see him do anything foolish. So I warned Rush to get out of town.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re a good friend,” Miller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Either that, or he’s protecting his investment, too,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s that supposed to mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored the question. Instead, I asked Kampa, “Did you arrange to meet Rush?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” he said. “I just told him that he was no longer welcome in Libbie and that he should leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about the mall?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It didn’t come up. It was a short conversation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned toward Miller. “That’s two versions. Want to make it three, turn it into a real Rashomon?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You heard the truth,” Miller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Which time? You know what, it doesn’t matter. Why don’t we call the cops and let them sort it out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“McKenzie, you said you weren’t going to call the police,” Mrs. Miller said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I lied,” I said. “Why not? Everyone else is doing it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine,” Miller said. “Call Chief Gustafson. See where that gets you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not going to call Gustafson. I’m going to call Big Joe Balk. I bet he asks if this has anything to do with the murders of Tracie Blake and Mike Randisi.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the expression on the big man’s face, he didn’t like that idea at all. Another reason to give the sheriff some respect, my inner voice told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve had enough of you,” Miller said. He used a big, beefy arm to nudge Kampa aside and moved close to me, a bully trying to use his size to intimidate. “You’re getting out of town. You’re getting out of town now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You remind me of Church. Remember what happened to him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not afraid of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller shoved hard enough against my chest to force me to take a couple of backward steps. I was surprised a man his age was that strong; it made me think that Michelle Miller’s plan to wait for his demise was not all that sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you think I’m afraid of you?” Miller asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed again, and again I had to give ground. He followed close behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t do that,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get out of town.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller leaned on me a third time. I retreated a few steps to maintain my balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t do that,” I said. “I’m serious.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I’m serious. I’ve had it with you, city boy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller brought both hands up and lunged toward my face. This time I caught his left hand between both of my hands, his knuckles between my palms, my fingers interlocked. I squeezed hard and lifted the hand high in the air while keeping the knuckles pressed together. I pushed his hand back as I pulled his arm down. The big man came down with it, falling to his knees in front of me. He shouted, “Let me go,” as I applied more pressure. It would have been easy to crumple his aging fingers, to snap his wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do believe you need anger management therapy,” I said. I squeezed his knuckles and bent his hand farther back, making him cry out in pain some more. “Get used to the idea—I’m not going anywhere until I find out what happened to the Imposter and all that money. In the meantime…” I leaned in close and hissed in his ear. “Say anything that you want, to me or about me, I don’t care. But you lay hands on me again, they’ll need tweezers to put you back together, I don’t give a damn how old you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI released his hand. He cradled it with the other and tried to massage the pain away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re having some fun now, aren’t we, kids?” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither the Millers nor Jon Kampa seemed to agree with me. I can’t say I blamed them. I didn’t mind hurting Miller—it wasn’t long ago that he had me Tasered, kidnapped, and locked in the trunk of a car, remember? On the other hand, I had accomplished nothing except to identify a couple more liars in a town that seemed loaded with them. Worse, I was no closer to finding the Imposter than when I started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is getting us nowhere,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left them there, crossing the concrete slab back to my car. Not for the first time, I wondered what the hell I was doing in Libbie, SD. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-taking-of-libbie-sd-mac-mckenzie-7/page-63.html","bookId":2219,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:43 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:43 PM"}
