READ ALL ABOUT IT! \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eThis is a time for families, for togetherness, for memories. On Christmas Eve, Maryanne and Nolan Adams tell their kids the story they most want to hear --- how Mom and Dad met and fell in love. It all started when they were reporters on rival Seattle papers ... and next thing you know, Here Comes Trouble! \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eChristmas is also a time for ... fruitcake. Rookie reporter Emma Collins hates fruitcake; for that matter, she hates Christmas, too. When three Washington State women are finalists in a national fruitcake contest, the story is assigned to her. That\u0027s bad enough. It gets worse when she has to fly in a small plane (scary!) with a smart-aleck pilot named Oliver Hamilton (sexy!) and his scruffy dog (cute!). In the end she meets three wise women, falls in love and learns There\u0027s Something About Christmas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/glad-tidings.jpg","author":"Debbie Macomber","type":"Christian","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/glad-tidings.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:57 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:08 PM"}
