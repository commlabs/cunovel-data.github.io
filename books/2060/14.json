She\u0027d always hated it when I did by accident, and now I did it on purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSteadily, I watched as she reintegrated herself into the royal power players one by one. She couldn\u0027t do group compulsion, but catching one person alone was just as effective, if slower. And really, a lot didn\u0027t need to be compelled to start hanging out with her again. Many weren\u0027t as shallow as they seemed; they remembered Lissa and liked her for who she was. They flocked to her, and now, a month and a half after our return to the Academy, it was like she\u0027d never left at all. And during this rise to fame, she advocated for me and rallied against Mia and Jesse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne morning, I tuned into her while she was getting ready for breakfast. She\u0027d spent the last twenty minutes blow-drying and straightening her hair, something she hadn\u0027t done in a while. Natalie, sitting on the bed in their room, watched the process with curiosity. When Lissa moved on to makeup, Natalie finally spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, we\u0027re going to watch a movie in Erin\u0027s room after school. You going to come?\" I\u0027d always made jokes about Natalie being boring, but her friend Erin had the personality of dry wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t. I\u0027m going to help Camille bleach Carly\u0027s hair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You sure spend a lot of time with them now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I guess.\" Lissa dabbed mascara across her lashes, instantly making her eyes look bigger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you didn\u0027t like them anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I changed my mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They sure seem to like you a lot now. I mean, not that anyone wouldn\u0027t like you, but once you came back and didn\u0027t talk to them, they seemed okay ignoring you too. I heard them talking about you a lot. I guess that\u0027s not surprising, because they\u0027re Mia\u0027s friends too, but isn\u0027t it weird how much they like you now? Like, I hear them always waiting to see what you want to do before they make plans and stuff. And a bunch of them are defending Rose now, which is really crazy. Not that I believe any of that stuff about her, but I never would have thought it was possible - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderneath Natalie\u0027s rambling was the seed of suspicion, and Lissa picked up on it. Natalie probably never would have dreamed of compulsion, but Lissa couldn\u0027t risk innocent questions turning into something more. \"You know what?\" she interrupted. \"Maybe I will swing by Erin\u0027s after all. I bet Carly\u0027s hair won\u0027t take that long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe offer derailed Natalie\u0027s train of thought. \"Really? Oh wow, that would be great. She was telling me how sad she was that you\u0027re not around as much anymore, and I told her...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn it went. Lissa continued her compulsion and return to popularity. I watched it all quietly, always worrying, even though her efforts were starting to reduce the stares and gossip about me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is going to backfire,\" I whispered to her in church one day. \"Someone\u0027s going to start wondering and asking questions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop being so melodramatic. Power shifts all the time around here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t think my winning personality could do this on its own?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I do, but if Christian spotted it right away, then someone else will - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy words were interrupted when two guys farther down the pew suddenly exploded into snickers. Glancing up, I saw them looking right at me, not even bothering to hide their smirks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking away, I tried to ignore them, suddenly hoping the priest would start up soon. But Lissa returned their looks, and a sudden fierceness flashed across her face. She didn\u0027t say a word, but their smiles grew smaller under her heavy gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell her you\u0027re sorry,\" she told them. \"And make sure she believes it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, they practically fell all over themselves apologizing to me and begging for forgiveness. I couldn\u0027t believe it. She\u0027d used compulsion in public - in church, of all places. And on two people at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey finally exhausted their supply of apologies, but Lissa wasn\u0027t finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the best you can do?\" she snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir eyes widened in alarm, both terrified that they\u0027d angered her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Liss,\" I said quickly, touching her arm. \"It\u0027s okay I, uh, accept their apologies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face still radiated disapproval, but she finally nodded. The guys slumped in relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYikes. I\u0027d never felt so relieved to have a service start. Through the bond, I felt a sort of dark satisfaction coming from Lissa. It was uncharacteristic for her, and I didn\u0027t like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeeding to distract myself from her troubling behavior, I studied other people as I so often did. Nearby, Christian openly watched Lissa, a troubled look on his face. When he saw me, he scowled and turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimitri sat in the back as usual, for once not scanning every corner for danger. His attention was turned inward, his expression almost pained. I still didn\u0027t know why he came to church. He always seemed to be wrestling with something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the front, the priest was talking about St. Vladimir again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His spirit was strong, and he was truly gifted by God. When he touched them, the crippled walked, and the blind could see. Where he walked, flowers bloomed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMan, the Moroi needed to get more saints -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHealing cripples and blind people?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d forgotten all about St. Vladimir. Mason had mentioned Vladimir bringing people back from the dead, and it had reminded me of Lissa at the time. Then other things had distracted me. I hadn\u0027t thought about the saint or his \"shadow-kissed\" guardian - and their bond - in a while. How could I have overlooked this? Ms. Karp, I realized, wasn\u0027t the only other Moroi who could heal like Lissa. Vladimir could too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And all the while, the masses gathered to him, loving him, eager to follow his teachings and hear him preach the word of God...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning, I stared at Lissa. She gave me a puzzled look. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t get a chance to elaborate - I don\u0027t even know if I could have formed the words - because I was whisked back to my prison almost as soon as I stood up at the end of the service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in my room, I went online to research St. Vladimir but turned up nothing useful. Damn it. Mason had skimmed the books in the library and said there was little there. What did that leave me with? I had no way of learning more about that dusty old saint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr did I? What had Christian said that first day with Lissa?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver there, we have an old box full of the writings of the blessed and crazy St. Vladimir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe storage room above the chapel. It had the writings. Christian had pointed them out. I needed to look at them, but how? I couldn\u0027t ask the priest. How would he react if he found out students were going up there? It\u0027d put an end to Christian\u0027s lair. But maybe...maybe Christian himself could help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Sunday, though, and I wouldn\u0027t see him until tomorrow afternoon. Even then, I didn\u0027t know if I\u0027d get a chance to talk to him alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile heading out to practice later, I stopped in the dorm\u0027s kitchen to grab a granola bar. As I did, I passed a couple of novice guys, Miles and Anthony. Miles whistled when he saw me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027s it been going, Rose? You getting lonely? Want some company?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnthony laughed. \"I can\u0027t bite you, but I can give you something else you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to pass through the doorway they stood in to get outside. Glaring, I pushed past, but Miles caught me around the waist, his hand sliding down to my butt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get your hands off my ass before I break your face,\" I told him, jerking away. In doing so, I only bumped into Anthony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" Anthony said, \"I thought you didn\u0027t have a problem taking on two guys at the same time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA new voice spoke up. \"If you guys don\u0027t walk away right now, I\u0027ll take both of you on.\" Mason. My hero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re so full of it, Ashford,\" said Miles. He was the bigger of the two and left me to go square off with Mason. Anthony backed off from me, more interested in whether or not there\u0027d be a fight. There was so much testosterone in the air, I felt like I needed a gas mask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you doing her too?\" Miles asked Mason. \"You don\u0027t want to share?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Say one more word about her, and I\u0027ll rip your head off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? She\u0027s just a cheap blood - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMason punched him. It didn\u0027t rip Miles\u0027 head off or even cause anything to break or bleed, but it looked like it hurt. His eyes widened, and he lunged toward Mason. The sound of doors opening in the hall caused everyone to freeze. Novices got in a lot of trouble for fighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably some guardians coming.\" Mason grinned. \"You want them to know you were beating up on a girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiles and Anthony exchanged glances. \"Come on,\" Anthony said. \"Let\u0027s go. We don\u0027t have time for this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiles reluctantly followed. \"I\u0027ll find you later, Ashford.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were gone, I turned on Mason. \" ¡®Beat up on a girl\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re welcome,\" he said drily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t need your help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. You were doing just fine on your own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They caught me off guard, that\u0027s all. I could have dealt with them eventually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, don\u0027t take being pissed off at them out on me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just don\u0027t like being treated like...a girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are a girl. And I was just trying to help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him and saw the earnestness on his face. He meant well. No point in being a bitch to him when I had so many other people to hate lately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...thanks. Sorry I snapped at you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe talked a little bit, and I managed to get him to spill some more school gossip. He had noticed Lissa\u0027s rise in status but didn\u0027t seem to find it strange. As I talked to him, I noticed the adoring look he always got around me spread across his face. It made me sad to have him feel that way about me. Guilty, even.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow hard would it be, I wondered, to go out with him? He was nice, funny, and reasonably good-looking. We got along. Why did I get caught up in so many messes with other guys when I had a perfectly sweet one here who wanted me? Why couldn\u0027t I just return his feelings?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer came to me before I\u0027d even finished asking myself the question. I couldn\u0027t be Mason\u0027s girlfriend because when I imagined someone holding me and whispering dirty things in my ear, he had a Russian accent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMason continued watching me admiringly, oblivious to what was going on in my head. And seeing that adoration, I suddenly realized how I could use it to my advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling a little guilty, I shifted my conversation to a more flirty style and watched Mason\u0027s glow increase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned beside him on the wall so our arms just touched and gave him a lazy smile. \"You know, I still don\u0027t approve of your whole hero thing, but you did scare them. That was almost worth it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you don\u0027t approve?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI trailed fingers up his arm. \"No. I mean, it\u0027s hot in principle but not in practice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"The hell it isn\u0027t.\" He caught hold of my hand and gave me a knowing look. \"Sometimes you need to be saved. I think you like being saved sometimes and just can\u0027t admit it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I think you get off on saving people and just can\u0027t admit it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think you know what gets me off. Saving damsels like you is just the honorable thing to do,\" he declared loftily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI repressed the urge to smack him over the use of damsels. \"Then prove it. Do me a favor just because it\u0027s ¡®the right thing to do.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" he said immediately. \"Name it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need you to get a message to Christian Ozera.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eagerness faltered. \"What the - ? You aren\u0027t serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Completely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rose...I can\u0027t talk to him. You know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you said you\u0027d help. I thought you said helping ¡®damsels\u0027 is the honorable thing to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t really see how honor\u0027s involved here.\" I gave him the most smoldering look I could manage. He caved. \"What do you want me to tell him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell him I need St. Vladimir\u0027s books. The ones in storage. He needs to sneak them to me soon. Tell him it\u0027s for Lissa. And tell him...tell him I lied the night of the reception.\" I hesitated. \"Tell him I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t make any sense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t have to. Just do it. Please?\" I turned on the beauty queen smile again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith hasty assurances that he\u0027d see what he could do, he left for lunch, and I went off to practice. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-academy-vampire-academy-1/page-14.html","bookId":2060,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:02:00 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:02:00 AM"}
