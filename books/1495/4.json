A very long time had passed already, and not a sound could be heard in the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had taken the body of the woman and put it on the bed. Then he had taken all the quilts in the house and placed them on top of her, as if she was afraid of catching cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that, he went around and lit all the lamps in the house, even the lamps in the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn’t afraid of death, and he wasn’t afraid of the dark. But in his heart he carried an indescribable hatred for both of them, and always wished to push them as far away as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he sat thinking, trying to wrap his mind around the whole matter, from head to tail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a quiet person, not very well known, to the point that even he was unsure of the extent of his own strength and ability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had never tested himself, had never even thought to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut “Power of Hu” Patriarch Hu had discovered him, the same way one might discover a pearl inside of a clam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatriarch Hu not only had sharp eyes, he had a mind with no equal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe never misjudged people, never misjudged anything—in fact he had never made a single error in judgement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though he had never worn the official headdress of a government official, had never eaten a meal provided by the government, he was without a doubt the most famous investigator alive. The chief constables of every administrative district and every prefecture virtually worshipped him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was not a case in the world that he couldn’t crack; as long as he was alive, there was not a single underworld criminal who could evade justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut sadly, even the fastest sword will eventually become dull; no matter how powerful the person, they will eventually become sick and old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had finally grown old and contracted rheumatism, could barely walk without the support of others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the two or three years after becoming ill, he had stayed in Beijing. In that time, several hundred serious crimes had been committed—three hundred thirty-two to be exact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong those over three hundred serious cases, not one had been solved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut leaving these cases unsolved was unacceptable. Among the victims were members of the nobility and high government officials, famous figures of the martial world, well-known and aristocratic families, and even the royal family itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatriarch Hu’s legs were crippled, but he was not blind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew that all of these crimes were committed by one person, and he also knew that only one person could solve them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe criminal was none other than Dragon Fifth, and the hero could be none other than Liu Changjie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone trusted his judgement in this matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was in this way that the quiet and unassuming Liu Changjie suddenly became a legend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently, Liu Changjie wasn’t sure if he had gotten lucky, or extremely unlucky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven now, he still didn’t completely understand what Patriarch Hu really thought of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed that he would never be able to understand that crafty old fox, and he would never understand his daughter, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought back to a year or so before, when he’d become friends with a man named Wang Nan. One day, Wang Nan had suddenly suggested that they go visit Patriarch Hu. Three months later, Patriarch Hu gave him this task, this burden. It wasn’t until this very night that he realized how heavy the burden really was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it really possible for him, in only one hour, to kill Tang Qing, Shan Yifei, Soul Enticing Lao Zhao, Iron Monk, Li the Mastiff and the woman? Could he really reach the mysterious wooden box? Could he really get his hands on Dragon Fifth?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly if he knew the answers to these questions, could he be truly confident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut lately, what really caused him anxiety was Hu Yue’er.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat kind of woman was she? How did she actually treat him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly he knew the answer to that question. After all, he was just a person, made of flesh and blood like everyone else. He wasn’t an emotionless rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was very, very late, but sunrise was still a long way off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat would tomorrow bring? What type of person would Dragon Fifth send to accompany him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed, wishing that he could just sit in the chair for the rest of the night and forget about all these troublesome thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut at that moment, he suddenly heard a strange sound, like a light rain hitting the roof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there was a boom, and the entire house burst into flames. It was as if house were made of paper; it was clearly impossible to extinguish the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no way Liu Changjie would be killed by a fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you put him in an actual furnace, he still might be able to get out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though the house was not a furnace, it burned like one. Everything was on fire, and nothing was visible other than the flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, Liu Changjie was able to escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dashed into the kitchen, grabbed an enormous jar of water, and poured it over his body. Almost before the water could soak his clothes, he was outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis reaction time was faster than most people could fathom, and fewer people could imagine how fast his body moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther than the burning building, the night was peaceful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the courtyard grew several patches of yellow-flowering plants. In the flickering light of the flames, the flowers seemed especially tender and beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding there was a young woman in yellow clothing, holding a yellow flower in her hand. She looked at Liu Changjie and chuckled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside the courtyard was a horse and carriage. The horse’s eyes were covered, so it was unaffected by the frightening inferno.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe yellow-robed girl flew like a swallow to the carriage and opened the door. She looked back at him and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t say a single word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie also said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe entered the carriage and sat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flames burned unceasingly, but Liu Changjie was further and further away from them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe carriage sped along urgently, having long disappeared into the deep night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a dark night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie wasn’t afraid of the dark, but in his heart he carried an indescribable hatred and disgust for it…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew. From socks to inner garment to outer robe, everything was brand new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven the bathtub was brand new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe carriage had just stopped inside the courtyard of a house, and Liu Changjie had followed the young woman inside. Waiting inside a room was a bathtub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe water was neither cold nor hot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young woman pointed at the basin; Liu Changjie stripped off his clothes and climbed in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t say a single word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither did he ask a single question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter he was finished washing, scrubbed dry, and ready to don fresh clothes, the young woman suddenly returned. She was followed by two people carrying another brand new wooden wash basin. It was full of water, the temperature of which was neither hot nor cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young woman pointed at it, and Liu Changjie looked into her eyes. After a moment, he climbed in, and began washing himself thoroughly, as if he hadn’t bathed in the past three months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was not the type of man who believed that water would sap his vitality. In actuality, he really enjoyed bathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also wasn’t the type of man who spoke out of turn. If others weren’t willing to talk, he usually didn’t ask questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut after the woman for a fourth time called in attendants with new water to bathe in, he couldn’t suppress his frustration any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis body had been scrubbed until it was as bright as a freshly peeled carrot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young woman once again pointed at the water, indicating for him to wash again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her and then suddenly laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed with him for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is there dog shit on my body?” asked Liu Changjie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed loudly. “No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is there cat shit?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not that either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then what is there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled her eyes, her round face reddening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was absolutely nothing on his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve already bathed three times,” said Liu Changjie. “Even if there was dog shit on my body, it’s long gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young woman nodded, her face red. She was old enough to be embarrassed by a naked man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do I have to bathe again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShocked, he replied, “You don’t know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All I know,” she responded, “Is that whoever meets the lady of this house, they must thoroughly wash from head to toe. Five times.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, Liu Changjie bathed five times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe donned a fresh set of clothes, and as he followed the young woman to meet “the lady,” he suddenly realized that bathing five times in a row wasn’t that bad after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis whole body felt relaxed, and walking down the long, glass-like corridor, it felt like he was gliding through the clouds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the corridor was a doorway, over which hung a curtain fashioned from pearls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe narrow door itself was unlocked, and on the other side was a spacious room with white walls and glossy wooden floors. The only decorations were a table, a chair, and a bronze mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding in front of the mirror admiring herself was a tall, slender woman wearing apricot-colored robes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie could see the reflection of her face in the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was impossible to deny that her face was beautiful, so beautiful that it could only be described as perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis level of beauty was otherworldly, like that of a celestial being in a painting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a level of beauty that most people would not be willing to approach, only admire from afar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Liu Changjie stood as far away as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him in the mirror, but she didn’t turn her head. She just coldy asked, “You are Liu Changjie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am Kong.

It was as if she had long decided that whoever heard her voice would be unable to hold back their shock upon hearing her name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie did not appear to be the least bit shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKong Lanjun laughed coldly. “I’ve never laid eyes on you before, but I already know what kind of person you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dragon Fifth said that you are very interesting, as are your money-spending methods.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He spoke correctly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lan Tianmeng said your bones are strong, that you can take a beating.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He also spoke correctly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But all the women who’ve met you used the same word to describe you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?
