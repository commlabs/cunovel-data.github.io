Both terms are gross, almost insulting, understatements\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you really think he’ll reward you?\" Perrin spat. \"How can you not realize that once you’ve done what he wishes of you, he’ll just discard you, as he has so many?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlayer laughed. \"Did he discard the Forsaken, when they failed and were imprisoned with him in the Bore? He could have slaughtered them all and kept their souls in eternal torment. Did he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin didn’t reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Dark One does not discard useful tools\", Slayer said. \"Fail him, and he may exact punishment, but he never discards. He’s like a goodwife, with her balls of tangled yarn and broken teakettles hidden away in the bottoms of baskets, waiting for the right moment to return them to usefulness. That is where you’re wrong, Aybara. A mere human might kill a tool who succeeds, fearing that the tool will threaten him. That is not the Dark One’s way. He will reward me\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin opened his mouth to reply, and Slayer shifted right in front of him to attack, thinking him distracted. Perrin vanished and Slayer struck only air. The man spun about, sword splitting the air, but Perrin had shifted to the opposite side. Small sea creatures with many arms undulated near his feet, confused at the sudden lack of water. Something large and dark swam through the shadowy water behind Slayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never answered my question\", Perrin said. \"What are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I’m bold\", Slayer said, striding forward. \"And I’m tired of being afraid. In this life, there are predators and there are prey. Often, the predators themselves become food for someone else. The only way to survive is to move up the chain, become the hunter\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That’s why you kill wolves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlayer smiled a dangerous smile, his face in shadows. With the storm clouds above and the high walls of water, it was dim here at the bottom—though the strange light of the wolf dream pierced this place, if in a muted way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wolves and men are the finest hunters in this world\", Slayer said softly. \"Kill them, and you elevate yourself above them. Not all of us had the privilege of growing up in a comfortable home with a warm hearth and laughing siblings\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin and Slayer rounded one another, shadows blending, lightning blasts above shimmering through the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you knew my life\", Slayer said, \"you’d howl. The hopelessness, the agony . . . I soon found my way. My power. In this place, I am a king\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaped across the space, his form a blur. Perrin prepared to swing, but Slayer didn’t draw his sword. He crashed into Perrin, throwing them both into the wall of water. The sea churned and bubbled around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarkness. Perrin created light, somehow making the rocks at his feet glow. Slayer had hold of his cloak with one hand and was swinging at him in the dark water, his sword trailing bubbles but moving as quickly as in the air. Perrin yelled, bubbles coming from his mouth. He tried to block, but his arms moved lethargically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that frozen moment, Perrin tried to imagine the water not impeding him, but his mind rejected that thought. It wasn’t natural. It couldn’t be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn desperation, Slayer’s sword nearly close enough to bite, Perrin froze the water solid around both of them. Doing so nearly crushed him, but it held Slayer still for a precarious moment while Perrin oriented himself. He made his cloak vanish so he wouldn’t take Slayer with him, then shifted away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin landed on the rocky beach beside a steep hillside that was half broken away by the power of the sea. He fell on hands and knees, gasping. Water streamed from his beard. His mind felt . . . numb. He had trouble thinking the water away from him to dry himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat’s happening? he thought, trembling. Around him, the storm raged, the bark ripping from tree trunks, their limbs already stripped away. He was just so . . . tired. Exhausted. How long had it been since he slept? Weeks had passed in the real world, but it couldn’t actually have been weeks here, could it? It—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sea boiled, churning. Perrin turned. He’d kept his hammer, somehow, and he raised it to face Slayer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waters continued to move, but nothing came from them. Suddenly, behind him, the hill split in half. Perrin felt something heavy hit him in the shoulder, like a punch. He fell to his knees, twisting to see the hillside broken in two, Slayer standing on the other side, nocking another arrow to his bow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerrin shifted, desperate, pain belatedly flaring up his side and across his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All I’m saying is that battles are being fought\", Mandevwin said, \"and we are not there\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Battles are always being fought somewhere\", Vanin replied, leaning back against the wall outside a warehouse in Tar Valon. Faile listened to them with half an ear. \"We’ve fought our share of them. All I’m saying is that I’m pleased to avoid this particular one\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People are dying\", Mandevwin said, disapproving. \"This is not simply a battle, Vanin. It is Tarmon Gai’don itself!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which means nobody is paying us\", Vanin said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandevwin sputtered, \"Paying . . . to fight the Last Battle . . . You knave! This battle means life itself\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaile smiled as she looked over the supply ledgers. The two Redarms idled by the doorway as servants wearing the Flame of Tar Valon loaded Faile’s caravan. Behind them, the White Tower rose over the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first, she had been annoyed by the banter, but the way Vanin poked at the other man reminded her of Gilber, one of her father’s quartermasters back in Saldaea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, Mandevwin\", Vanin said, \"you hardly sound like a mercenary at all! What if Lord Mat heard you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lord Mat will fight\", said Mandevwin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When he has to\", Vanin said. \"We don’t have to. Look, these supplies are important, right? And someone has to guard them, right? Here we are\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just do not see why this job requires us. I should be helping Talmanes lead the Band, and you lot, you should be guarding Lord Mat . . \".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaile could almost hear the end of that line, the one they were all thinking. You should be guarding Lord \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-192.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
