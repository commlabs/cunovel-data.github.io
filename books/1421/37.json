FIVE YEARS AFTER.","content":"And after all perhaps \u0027tis best\n\u003cbr\u003e To make no mention of the past;\n\u003cbr\u003e The clouds have vanished and to all\n\u003cbr\u003e The peaceful days have come at last.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Five years have passed away since that death in the lonely prison cell, but from that day, Sam Lee disappeared as completely from the gaze of man as if he, too, had journeyed to the world from whence there is no returning.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Search was unavailing and inquiry and investigation alike, fruitless.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The autopsy made upon the dead man\u0027s body revealed nothing other than asphyxiation by an unknown drug, but whether administered by his own or other hands, was never ascertained.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\n\u003cbr\u003e Men reasoned, argued and theorized, and at last lost interest.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For Elizabeth\u0027s sake, Sir Frederic saw that the body was decently interred and then made haste to return once more to Portland Place, as it was Stella\u0027s ardent wish that her child should be born in the home so dear to her own youthful associations.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Little Archie is now nearly five years old and baby Millie just turned one, but they have thus early demonstrated their importance in the Atherton family, and no one dreams for a moment of denying their claims to attention and worship.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Sinclair is radiantly happy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Little Archie is her husband\u0027s namesake, and on him she lavishes so much of her tender love that Stella often wonders if baby Millie will not some day look with jealous eyes upon her grandma\u0027s preference.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The children are frequent visitors at the house in Gâ€”St., where Elsa watches carefully over their frolics with the conscious dignity of her mature years.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Elizabeth thought at first that she could not[Pg 231] endure to live again beneath the walls that had been the scenes of her perilous infatuation, but of late a peaceful smile lights up her lovely features and the old house has been turned completely upside down with her tasteful renovations.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Perhaps little Elsa explains matters somewhat when she grasps Mr. Morris\u0027 extended hand and leading him gaily to her playmates, says confidentially, \"This is my new papa, Archie, mamma says so!\" and \"Mamma,\" who has entered at that moment, comes blushingly forward to be held for a moment in her young husband\u0027s arms, while the first deep feeling of perfect love thrills her long sorrowing heart with joy unspeakable.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As for Sir Frederic, he has watched carefully for any signs of knowledge on the part of Lady Van Tyne regarding the suspicions which Dr. Seward so conscientiously revealed to him, but the years go by and there is no word.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Lady Van Tyne sits calmly on her pedestal of virtue, and although its foundations are of gold, still there is enough of that precious metal to secure her position for many years to come, and positive that no word of hers will ever destroy her social prominence, Sir Frederic locks the guilty secret in his heart and turning to the sweet faced women whom he loves, breathes silently a solemn vow of \"Death to the Inquisitive.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cstrong\u003eTHE END\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2720/74796.html","bookId":1421,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 11:46:09 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 11:46:09 AM"}
