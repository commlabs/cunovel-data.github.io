The intercom clicked. \"Prepare to close, please.\" The doors were closed, clicked shut. Thunk, thank. The air was still cold.

She felt the thump of me wheels going over the cracks in the runway.

Everybody comfy? If you look to your left, you will see our chase plane coming alongside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer looked out and saw a silver jet fighter, glinting in the morning light It was very close to their aircraft, close enough to see the pilot wave. Then suddenly it slid backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick. \"Uh, you probably won\u0027t see much more of him, he\u0027ll be staying high and behind us, out of our wake, the safest place to be.

She said, \"Why are we going up so fast?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wants to get to altitude quickly, to cold soak the plane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cold soak?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At thirty-seven thousand feet, the air temperature is minus fifty degrees. The airplane is warmer than that right now, and different parts will cool off at different rates, but eventually on a long flight - such as a long Pacific crossing - all the parts of the plane will reach that temperature. One of the questions for the IRT is whether the cable rigging behaves differently at cold temperature. Cold soaking means putting the plane up at altitude long enough to cool it down. Then we begin the test\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long are we talking?\" Jennifer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Standard cold soak is two hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to sit here for two hours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSingleton looked at her. \"You wanted to come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean we spend two hours doing nothing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick. \"Oh, we\u0027ll try to amuse you, Ms. Malone,\" the pilot said. \"We\u0027re now at twenty-two thousand feet and climbing.

That\u0027s the usual cruise speed for commercial aircraft Everybody comfy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer said, \"Can you hear us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can hear you and see you. And if you look to your right, you can see me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA monitor in the cabin in front of them came on. Jennifer saw the pilot\u0027s shoulder, his head, the controls arrayed in front of him. Bright light out the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow they were high enough that full sunlight streamed in through the windows. But the ulterior of the plane was still cold. Because she was sitting in the center of the cabin, Jennifer could not see the ground out the windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Singleton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSingleton smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick. \"Ah, okay, we are now at flight level three seven zero, Doppler clear, no turbulence, a beautiful day in the neighborhood. Would you ladies please unbuckle your harnesses, and come to the cockpit\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat? Jennifer thought But Singleton was already taking hers off, standing up in the cabin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought we couldn\u0027t walk around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay right now,\" Singleton said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer climbed out of her harness, and walked with Singleton up through first class, to the cockpit. She felt the faint vibration of the airplane beneath her feet. But it was quite stable. The door to the cockpit was open. She saw Rawley in there, with a second man he didn\u0027t introduce, and a third who was working with some instrumentation. Jennifer stood with Singleton just outside the cockpit looking in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now Ms. Malone,\" Rawley said. \"You interviewed Mr. Barker, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did he say was the cause of the accident?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said the slats deployed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. Okay, please watch carefully. This is the flaps slats handle here. We are at cruise speed, cruise altitude. I am now going to deploy the slats.\" He reached his hand forward to the thing between the seats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute! Let me get strapped in!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re perfectly safe, Ms. Malone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to sit down, at least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then sit down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer started back, then realized that Singleton was remaining standing by the cockpit door. Staring at her. Feeling foolish, Jennifer went back and stood by Singleton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deploying slats now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRawley pushed the lever down. She heard a faint rumble that lasted a few seconds. Nothing else. The nose tilted, steadied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slats are extended.\" Rawley pointed to the instrument panel. \"You see the speed? You see the altitude? And you see that indicator that says SLATS? We have just duplicated the exact conditions that Mr. Barker insists caused the death of three people, on this very same aircraft. And as you see, nothing happened. The attitude is rock solid. Want to try again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said. She didn\u0027t know what else to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. Slats retracting. This time, maybe you\u0027d like to do it yourself, Ms. Malone. Or maybe you\u0027d like to walk over and look at the wings, see what actually happens when the slats extend. It\u0027s kind of neat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRawley pressed a button. \"Ah, Norton station, this is zero one, can I have a monitor check?\" He listened a moment. \"Okay, fine. Ms. Malone, move a little forward, so your friends can see you on that camera up there.\" He pointed up to the ceiling of the cockpit. \"Give \u0027em a wave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer waved, feeling foolish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ms. Malone, how many more times would you like us to extend and retract the slats to satisfy your cameras?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027t know ...\" She was feeling more foolish by the minute. The flight test was starting to seem like a trap. The footage would make Barker look like a fool. It would make the whole segment look ridiculous. It would make -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can do this all day, if you like,\" Rawley was saying. \"That\u0027s the point. No problem deploying the slats at cruise speed on the N-22. Plane can handle it fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Try it once more,\" she said, tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the handle there. Just flip that little metal cover up, and pull it down about an inch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew what he was doing. Putting her in the shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think you\u0027d better do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am. Whatever you say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRawley pulled the lever down. The rumbling occurred again. The nose went up slightly. Exactly as before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now,\" Rawley said, \"we\u0027ve got the chase plane getting views for you showing the slats extending, so you\u0027ll have exterior angles showing all the action. Okay? Slats retracting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched impatiently. \"Well,\" she said. \"If the slats didn\u0027t cause this accident, what did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSingleton spoke for the first time. \"How long has it been now, Teddy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve been up twenty-three minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that long enough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. Could happen any minute now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What could happen?\" Jennifer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The first part of the sequence,\" Singleton said, \"that caused the accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The first part of the sequence?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Singleton said. \"Nearly all aircraft accidents are the result of a sequence of events. We call it a cascade. It\u0027s never one thing. There\u0027s a chain of events, one after another. On this aircraft, we believe the initiating event was an erroneous fault reading, caused by a bad part.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a sense of dread, Jennifer said, \"A bad part?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was immediately recutting the tape in her mind. Getting around this awkward point. Singleton had said it was the initiating event. That didn\u0027t have to be emphasized, especially if it was just a link in the chain of events. The next link in the chain was equally important - probably more important After all, what had happened on 545 was terrifying and spectacular, it involved the whole airplane, and it was surely unreasonable to blame it on a bad part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said there was a chain of events...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right,\" Singleton said. \"Several events in a sequence that we believe led to the final outcome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer felt her shoulders drop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive minutes went by. Jennifer was cold. She kept glancing at her watch. \"What exactly are we waiting for?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Patience,\" Singleton said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there was an electronic ping, and she saw amber words flash on the instrument panel. It said SLATS DISAGREE.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There it is,\" Rawley said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There what is?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An indication that the FDAU believes the slats are not where they\u0027re supposed to be. As you see, the slats lever is up, so the slats should be stowed. And we know they are. But the airplane is picking up a reading that they are not stowed. In this case, we know the warning is coming from a bad proximity sensor in the right wing. The proximity sensor should read the presence of the retracted slat. But this sensor\u0027s been damaged. And when the sensor gets cold, it behaves erratically. Tells the pilot the slats are extended, when they\u0027re not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer was shaking her head. \"Proximity sensor ... I\u0027m not following you. What does this have to do with Flight 5457\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSingleton said, \u0027The cockpit on 545 got a warning that something was wrong with the slats. Warnings like that happen fairly frequently. The pilot doesn\u0027t know whether something is really wrong, or whether the sensor is just acting up. So the pilot tries to clear the warning; he runs out the slats and retracts them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So the pilot on 545 deployed the slats, to clear the warning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But deploying the slats didn\u0027t cause the accident...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. We\u0027 ve just demonstrated that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRawley said, \"Ladies, if you will please take your seats, we will now attempt to reproduce the event.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eABOARD TPA 545\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6:25 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the center passenger cabin, Casey pulled the harness straps over her shoulders and cinched them tight She looked over at Malone, who was sweating, her face pale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Tighter,\" Casey said\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I already did - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey reached over, grabbed her waist strap, and pulled as hard as she could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone grunted. \"Hey, for Christ\u0027s - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t much like you,\" Casey said, \"but I don\u0027t want your little ass getting hurt on my watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone wiped her forehead with the back of her hand.

She didn\u0027t think Teddy was right about the airframe cracking; she didn\u0027t think he was foolish enough to go up in a plane that hadn\u0027t been thoroughly checked. He had hung around every minute of the tests, during the structural work, the CET, because he knew in a few days he was going to have to fly it. Teddy wasn\u0027t stupid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was a test pilot, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd all test pilots were crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick. \"All right, ladies, we are initiating the sequence.

I am out of the autopilot now. Nose is up, speed decreases... and I now have a stall...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey heard the harsh electronic alarm, sounding again and again. Then the audio warning, the recorded voice flat and insistent: \"Stall... Stall...

Casey\u0027s body was pressing hard against the harness straps. Sitting beside her, Jennifer Malone began to scream, her mouth open, a single unvarying scream that merged with the scream of the engines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey felt dizzy. She tried to count how long it was lasting. Five... six ... seven... eight seconds... How long had the initial descent been?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBit by bit, the plane began to level, to come out of the dive. The scream of die engines faded, changed to a lower register. Casey felt her body grow heavy, then heavier still, then amazingly heavy, her cheeks sagging, her arms pressed down to the armrests. The G-forces. They were at more than two Gs. Casey now weighed two hundred and fifty pounds. She sank lower in the seat, pressed down by a giant hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeside her, Jennifer had stopped screaming, and now was making a continuous low groan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sensation of weight decreased as the plane started to climb again. At first the climb was reasonable, then uncomfortable - then it seemed to be straight up. The engines were screaming. Jennifer was screaming. Casey tried to count the seconds but couldn\u0027t She didn\u0027t have the energy to focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd suddenly she felt the pit of her stomach begin to rise, followed by nausea, and she saw the monitor lift off the floor for a moment held in place by the straps. They were weightless at the peak of the climb. Jennifer threw her hand over her mouth. Then the plane was going over... and down again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick. \"Second pitch oscillation...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother steep dive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer took her hand away from her mouth and screamed, much louder man before. Casey tried to hold on to the armrests, tried to occupy her mind. She had forgotten to count she had forgotten to -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weight again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinking. Pressing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep into the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey couldn\u0027t move. She couldn\u0027t turn her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen they were climbing again, steeper than before, the shriek of the engines loud in her ears, and she felt Jennifer reach for her, Jennifer grabbing her arm. Casey turned to look at her, and Jennifer, pale and wild-eyed, was shouting:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plane was coming to the top of the rise. Her stomach lifting, a sickening sensation. Jennifer\u0027s stricken look, hand clapped to her mouth. Vomit spurting through her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plane going over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother dive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick. \"Releasing the luggage bins. Give you a sense of how it was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong both aisles, the luggage bins above the seats sprang open, and two-foot white blocks spilled out They were harmless neoprene foam, but they bounced around the cabin like a dense blizzard. Casey felt them strike her face, the back of her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer was retching again, trying to pull the bag from under her leg. The blocks tumbled forward, moving down the cabin toward the cockpit. They obscured their view on all sides, until one by one, they began to fall to the floor, roll over, and remain mere. The whine of the engines changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sinking drag of added weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plane was going up again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pilot in the F-14 chase plane watched as the big Norton widebody streaked upward through the clouds, climbing at twenty-one degrees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027Teddy,\" he said over the radio. \"What the hell are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just reproducing what\u0027s on the flight recorder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Christ,\" the pilot said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe huge passenger jet roared upward, breaking through cloud cover at thirty-one thousand feet. Going up another thousand feet, before losing speed. Approaching stall. Then nosing over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer vomited explosively into the bag. It spilled out over her hands, dribbled onto her lap. She turned to Casey, her face green, weak, contorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it, please. . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plane had started to nose over again. Going down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey looked at her. \"Don\u0027t you want to reproduce the full event for your cameras? Great visuals. Two more cycles to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plane was diving steeply now. Still looking at Jennifer, Casey said, \u0027Teddy! Teddy, take your hands off the controls!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer\u0027s eyes widened. Horrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClick. \"Roger. Taking my hands off now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately the plane leveled out. Smoothly, gently. The scream of the engines abated to a constant, steady roar. The foam blocks fell to the carpet, tumbled once, and did not move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevel flight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunlight streamed through the windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer wiped vomit from her lips with the back of her hand. She stared around the cabin in a daze. \"What . . . what happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The pilot took his hands off the stick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer shook her head, not understanding. Her eyes were glazed. In a weak voice she said, \"He took his hands off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey nodded. \"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well then ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The autopilot is flying the plane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone collapsed back in her seat, put her head back. Closed her eyes. \"I don\u0027t understand,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027To end the incident on Right 545, all the pilot had to do was take his hands off the column. If he had taken his hands away, it would have ended immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer sighed. \"Then why didn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey didn\u0027t answer her. She turned to the monitor. \u0027Teddy,\" she said, \"let\u0027s go back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYUMA TEST STATION\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9:45 A.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack on the ground, Casey went through the main room of the Flight Test Station, and into the pilots\u0027 room. It was an old, wood-paneled lounge for test pilots from the days when Norton still made military aircraft. A lumpy green couch, faded gray from sunlight. A couple of metal flight chairs, pulled up to a scratched Formica table. The only new object in the room was a small television, with a built-in tape deck. It stood beside a battered Coke machine, with a taped card that said OUT OF ORDER. In the window, a grinding air conditioner. It was already blazing hot on the airfield, and the room was uncomfortably warm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey looked through the window at the Newsline crew, walking around Flight 545, filming it as it sat on the runway. The aircraft gleamed in the bright desert sun. The crew seemed lost, not certain what to do. They aimed their cameras as if composing a shot, then lowered them again immediately. They seemed to be waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey opened the manila folder she had brought with her, and looked through the sheets of paper inside. The color Xeroxes she asked Norma to make had turned out rather well. And the telexes were satisfactory. Everything was in order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went to the television, which she had ordered brought out here. She pushed a tape into the deck, and waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWaited for Malone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey was tired. Then she remembered the scope. She rolled up her sleeve, and pulled off the four circular bandages arranged in a row on the skin of her arm. Scopolamine patches, for motion sickness. That was why she had not vomited on the plane. She had known what she was in for, Malone had not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey had no sympathy for her. She just wanted to be finished. This would be the last step. This would end it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only person at Norton who really knew what she was doing was Fuller. Fuller had understood immediately when Casey had called him from Video Imaging. Fuller recognized the implications of releasing the tape to Newsline. He saw what it would do to them, how they might be boxed in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlight Test had done that \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/airframe/page-24.html","bookId":2409,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:22 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:22 AM"}
