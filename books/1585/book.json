Coupled with his unstoppable determination, it will take him back to where he thrives: the thick of the action. Drafted into a new war, this time in our homeland, Chapel is tasked with hunting a group of escapees from a top secret military compound-all extremely deadly, genetically modified killers-and unraveling the mystery behind their existence. Aided by an enigmatic woman named Angel and a courageous, beautiful veterinarian, Chapel begins a cross-country hunt to stop the murders. But are the killers really rogues, or are they part of a sinister conspiracy that reaches into the highest levels?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/chimera-a-jim-chapel-mission-jim-chapel-1.jpg","author":"David Wellington","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/chimera-a-jim-chapel-mission-jim-chapel-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:45 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:16:29 AM"}
