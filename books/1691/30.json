Most of it was unpleasant at worst and difficult at best, so she was perfectly happy to find ready-made excuses to avoid it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got her wish. Independence Day festivities, just over, had increased her patient load. The newly arrived medical students, unruly as the ones before them, demanded far more than their fair share of attention. Not only did she have to help them in the classroom, but she was constantly needed to reassure angry landlords who wanted to kill the kids or sue their parents, whichever turned out to be simplest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer life developed a tedious rhythm. She worked. She slept. She ate. Now and then she had dinner with an old friend, but knowing she was not good company, she soon gave up on that. She had heard nothing from Manny and assumed that he was off-island on one of the mysterious trips which often kept him away for months at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, suddenly, somehow, it was nearing the end of May.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarnival wasn\u0027t until August, the students had settled down, and fewer tourists than usual demanded her time. She even found herself with a whole weekend to spend sitting on her balcony. The postcard perfection of St. George\u0027s and the Carenage provided her with a backdrop for a too-long-delayed replay of the happenings in her life since December.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMostly, her mind was not so much filled with questions, but rather with answers she was loath to accept. For one thing, she was sure now that Frikkie - who had not so much as called with a trumped- up apology for the events at San Gabriel - didn\u0027t care if the rest of the Daredevils were killed. In fact, though she had no proof, she suspected that he had been instrumental in killing Arthur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorse yet, thinking back to that night in New York almost five months ago, she remembered that Ray had gone to the restrooms a little while before Arthur. Ray was a demolitions expert. It would have been easy for him to rig a bomb in the toilet, wait for Arthur to enter, and then detonate it by remote control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would place Ray Arno squarely in cahoots with Frik.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat she needed was someone to talk to about all of this, someone she could trust completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Arthur dead, that left only Manny. She would have called his home to see if he was back in town, but he eschewed telephones and refused to have one in his house. His message center was Aboo\u0027s, a bar owned by his father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince she was tired of her own company and her circular thoughts, around sundown on Sunday she left her house to find him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccompanied by the sound of church bells, she walked past the Parliament building and through the marketplace, abandoned this late in the day to island dogs and stray humans picking through the wilted leftovers of Saturday\u0027s traffic. Rather than struggle over the hill on Young Street, she cut through Sendall Tunnel to the Carenage. Grenadian drivers weren\u0027t known for their caution, and the narrow hundred-year-old passage under the large hill provided little room for error. She walked at a brisk pace, hugging the stone wall. Then, safely through, she slowed to stroll along the Carenage, enjoying the sounds and smells of the compact waterfront.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she passed the new Cable and Wireless building, she crossed the street to Aboo\u0027s Bar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe small, run-down blue shack doubled as St. George\u0027s Grand Central Station for a certain class of people. Though Peta had chosen never to ask Manny about it or to explore it herself, rumor had it that there was a dark room behind the bar which had served - still served - as the meeting place for everyone from murderers and ministers to government officials and their underage mistresses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bar itself was small and utilitarian. Manny was behind the counter, relieving his father of Sunday- evening duty. He grinned broadly when she entered and instantly pulled out two cold bottles of Carib from the ice chest, one for each of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looking good.\" He kissed her on one cheek, then the other, and handed her a bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeta smiled. \"I\u0027m glad to see you too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You come all this way for a beer or - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to talk to you.\" Peta drank deeply, hot after her long trek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So talk.\" Manny waved at the empty bar. \"Crowd won\u0027t hit till after church.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeta settled herself on a worn barstool and lit a cigarette. Manny took it from her. \"You gotta stop,\" he said, inhaling deeply. Peta nodded and lit another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re hopeless,\" Manny said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably.\" She flicked into a piece of misshapen aluminum that passed as an ashtray. \"There\u0027s so much...I\u0027m not sure where to begin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The last time I saw you, you were headed up the hill in San Gabriel,\" Manny said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. I was off to save Simon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeta shook her head. Like someone who had lost her place in a good novel and found it again, Peta was off and running. She told him about finding Simon and about the attempt on her life. \"Blaine got the artifact. If the sharks didn\u0027t get him, I assume he made it to the exploration platform and, eventually, back to Frik,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you think Frikkie has it now?\" Manny asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely.\" She crushed her cigarette, reached for another, and thought better of it. Twirling the pack around like a top, she filled in Manny on her convictions about Frik and her suspicions about Ray.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManny put his hand over hers to stop the nervous mannerism. \"I can\u0027t believe Ray would do anything to hurt Arthur, so let\u0027s talk about Frik,\" he said. \"Correct me if I\u0027m wrong here. You\u0027re saying Frikkie has two pieces of the artifact, one that he had in the first place and the one Simon died to retrieve. The same one Blaine took from you. And you\u0027re saying that you think Arthur died because of the piecehe had - which the police took to their evidence lockup. Have you tried to retrieve that one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027ve called NYPD countless times. They\u0027re not ready to let go of it. The good part is that they\u0027ve assured me they won\u0027t release it to anyone else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn San Gabriel, Peta had told Manny that she had a piece of the artifact, yet neither one of them added the obvious: if Frik knew she had it - and if her theories were correct - he wouldn\u0027t hesitate to kill her for it when he was good and ready to do so. Now, Manny verbalized his fears for her safety. \"We know he\u0027s unscrupulous,\" he added, after a short pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Believe me, I\u0027ve thought about that a lot,\" Peta said. \"I think that I\u0027m safe, for the moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it suits his purposes. We talked before about the possibility that Frik was the person who had Arthur killed to get at the artifact. We know for a fact that the killer didn\u0027t get it. My guess is that Frik called NYPD, said he was Arthur\u0027s closest friend, and asked them if they had it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In which case,\" Manny said, \"they would have told him that they had guaranteed to hand it over to you when they\u0027re done with the case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, so his best bet is to make nice to me and try to regain my confidence so that he can talk me into giving him both my stone and Arthur\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to think about this.\" Manny stared through the open doorway, as if simply looking at the sea would provide answers. \"Oh shi-yit,\" he said. \"Trouble approaches from all sides.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeta followed his line of vision. Out on the horizon, she saw the masts of theAssegai .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he\u0027s come to apologize.\" Manny\u0027s voice was heavy with sarcasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apologize for what?\" Ray asked, filling the doorway with his muscular form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here\u0027s the other trouble I saw,\" Manny said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got here yesterday. Didn\u0027t your father tell you?\" Ray shook Manny\u0027s hand and hugged Peta. She froze, not knowing whether to shrink from his touch or hug him back, the way she had always done. He looked at her strangely, but said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My father didn\u0027t say a word.\" Manny handed Ray a beer and Peta a second. \"Better get a refund on your bribe. How much was it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"American?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay nodded. \"He said he hadn\u0027t seen you for weeks. I asked the other people in here too. A couple of leathery old men and that layabout fisherman whose wife always comes in looking for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManny laughed. \"How much did you tipthem ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not much.\" Ray set down his beer among the many circular rings on the single Formica tabletop in the corner of the bar. \"Feels like home,\" he said, cooling himself under the slow-moving ceiling fan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To what do we owe this visit?\" Peta asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been with Terris and - \" He stopped short, clearly reluctant to continue whatever it was he had to say in front of Peta. \"Look, this is confidential.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about it. The last thing I need is your little-boy games.\" Peta slid off the stool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Ray said. \"Arthur\u0027s dead, but you\u0027re not yet officially a member of the club. That doesn\u0027t mean you don\u0027t have my respect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem. I\u0027m leaving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay,\" Manny said. \"I\u0027m not a member of the club either. Whatever I can hear, you can hear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeta was torn between her first instinct, which was to tell Ray to stick it, and her need to find out what part - if any - he had played in Arthur\u0027s death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you have doctor-type things to do, I can call you later,\" Ray said hesitantly. \"You\u0027re in my database.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bad idea,\" Manny said. \"You know as well as we do what a problem it is keeping things confidential when dealing with our telephone system.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeta knew that Ray couldn\u0027t argue with him, not after being privy to many an argument with Grenadian officials about the fact that line tapping was legal on the island. Any attempt at privacy here was more of a challenge than all of the death-defying feats Ray had accomplished in his lifetime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJudging by the look on the American\u0027s face, he was making a tough decision. \"I\u0027ve been on theValhalla with Terris,\" he said finally. \"Took a short island hop from the rig to Trinidad, then a flight here.\" He looked around, as if searching for eavesdroppers, then lowered his voice and looked at Manny. \"We need your help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout wasting words, he filled them in on McKendry\u0027s plan to find Selene. Even before he was finished, Manny had admitted that he knew where to find the camp and agreed to participate on the condition that killing was minimized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m coming too,\" Peta said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027m going to do what Arthur would have done. First of all, it\u0027ll save time if I fly you to Trinidad. Second, you may need a doctor - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t argue with her,\" Manny said. \"It\u0027s both of us, or neither. I\u0027ll sail down so we have my boat. I can leave in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll clear things with my locum tonight,\" Peta added. She thought for a moment. \"Frik will probably call me on the pretext of seeing if I\u0027m all right after the incident in the cavern.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was about to ask what she should say to him when, right on cue, her cell phone jangled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Frik here. I\u0027m sailing in. I want to apologize to you for the debacle in San Gabriel. Will you have dinner with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m busy,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tomorrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m flying out in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was silence at the other end. \"I really need to see you,\" Frik said at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll have to wait.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t be here again until Carnival.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAugust will be too late to feel me out, too late to find out what I know, Peta thought. Nevertheless, deciding she needed some insurance should he become persistent, she said a cursory farewell to Frik and a warm one to Manny. To Ray she said merely, \"Be at the airport at noon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExiting Aboo\u0027s, she made her way past the awnings of the tourist shops toward the coal pot where an old woman was roasting corn on a makeshift grill over glowing coals. She bought several ears, wrapped them in one of the sheets of newspaper piled next to the fire, and flagged down one of the few taxis that roamed the Carenage on a Sunday evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith darkness descending and the sound of a lone steel drum in her ears, she directed the driver to take her home. She called the airport to tell them to have her plane ready for departure at noon. Then she ate her corn, bathed, and packed a small overnight bag. Before midnight, she was fast asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning, carrying nothing but a tote and her medical bag, she drove her Honda to the bank. She took her pendant out of her safe-deposit box, pocketed it, and headed toward Morne Rouge and her Rasta friend, Ralphie Levine. He was the only person on the island who could be trusted to do what she needed to have done: replicate the piece in her pendant and swap the two, putting his fake in the bezel while he held on to the original.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything went so smoothly that Peta was at the airport thirty minutes early. She made one last check on her plane and headed upstairs to the coffee shop. Ray was already there, eating a lunch of chicken roti. He pulled a small bone out of his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have some,\" he said, pushing the roti toward her. \"It\u0027s good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know it is.\" Though she never tired of the lightly curried chicken, cut into small pieces and wrapped, bones and all, in a thin East Indian flatbread, she scooted the dish back at him. \"I don\u0027t eat before I fly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong, Peta? Have I done something to upset you?\" Ray looked genuinely distressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, Ray. Have you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would never do anything to hurt you. Surely you know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRay took her hand. His touch was warm and reassuring. \"I do know that.\" She smiled at him and retrieved her hand. \"Now let\u0027s get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t until the two of them stepped onto the tarmac that she saw Frik. He was dressed in long pants, wore shoes, and carried a briefcase - formal attire for him. His eye remained partially closed; his hand was wrapped in pressure bandages in a continuing attempt to minimize scarring from the deep burns he\u0027d suffered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know where you\u0027re going and what you\u0027re going to do,\" he said. \"McKendry told me all about it. I\u0027m coming along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a chance,\" Peta said quietly. \"It\u0027s my plane and you\u0027re not getting on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blocked her path. \"You\u0027retellingme what to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup. Now get out of my way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrik didn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You heard the lady, Van Alman,\" Ray said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if we wanted you on board, you\u0027re in no shape to come,\" Peta added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrik stood his ground. Peta and Ray walked around him and headed for the plane. He followed them. Peta slowed down almost imperceptibly. When he was so close that she could feel his breath on her neck, she stopped in her tracks and turned around, forcing him to step aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What part of \u0027no\u0027 do you not understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrik stared at her, eyes filled with hatred. Waving his bandaged hand perilously close to her face, he said, \"You\u0027ll regret this, bitch. One hand - no hands - I\u0027m twice as good as any woman.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/artifact/page-30.html","bookId":1691,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:38 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:38 AM"}
