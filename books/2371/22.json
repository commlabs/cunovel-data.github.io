But there was nothing that excited me. I was resolved that the first picture I produced would be something I could be proud of. Three weeks after I had been made a producer, Dore Schary\u0027s secretary called me. \"Mr. Schary would like to see you in his office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell him I\u0027ll be right there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes later, I was facing Dore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated a moment, and then said, \"Harry Cohn called.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He asked for permission to negotiate a deal with you to become head of production at Columbia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was stunned. \"I had no idea he was - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I talked to Mr. Mayer and we decided that we would say no. There are two reasons. First of all, we\u0027re very happy with what you\u0027re doing here. Secondly, we feel Harry Cohn would destroy you. He\u0027s a very difficult man to work with. I called Cohn back and told him our decision.\" He looked at me expectantly. \"It\u0027s up to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a lot to think about. Running a major studio was the most prestigious job in Hollywood. On the other hand, Schary and Mayer were probably right about my working for Cohn. I remembered the scene in Cohn\u0027s office. Harry, I have Donna Reed on the line. Tony\u0027s regiment is being sent overseas and Donna wants to be with him in San Francisco until he leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe can\u0027t go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid I want to spend my days working for a man like that? I made a decision. I said, \"I\u0027m happy here, Dore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"Good. We don\u0027t want to lose you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got back to my office, Harris Katleman, an agent at MCA, the top agency in Hollywood, was waiting for me. \"I hear that Harry Cohn wants you to run Columbia.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNews travels fast, I thought. \"That\u0027s right. Dore just told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our agency would like to represent you, Sidney. We can make a hell of a deal for you and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head. \"I appreciate it, Harris, but I\u0027ve decided not to accept his offer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked surprised. \"I\u0027ve never heard of anyone turning down a chance to run a studio.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood there, trying to think of something to say. There was nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could not help but wonder what my life would have been like if I had accepted Harry Cohn\u0027s offer, and I was thinking about how far I had come. I thought about the guard at the entrance to Columbia Studios. I want to be a writer. Who do I see?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you have an appointment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, but -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen you don\u0027t see anybody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere must be someone I -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot without an appointment . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry Cohn wants you to run Columbia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShortly after my conversation with Dore, I was having lunch in the studio commissary, when I saw Zsa Zsa Gabor at a nearby table, with a lovely-looking young brunette. I had met Zsa Zsa several months earlier and I found her amusing. She and her sisters, Eva and Magda, were already Hollywood legends, famous for being famous. They had come from Hungary and quickly established themselves in Hollywood as eccentric, talented women. At the moment, it was Zsa Zsa\u0027s companion I was interested in. When I finished lunch, I went over to Zsa Zsa\u0027s table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darling - \" That was her usual greeting to everyone, including strangers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Zsa Zsa.\" We did the Hollywood air kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to the young woman with her. \"I would like you to meet Jorja Curtright. She\u0027s a wonderful actress. This is Sidney Sheldon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJorja nodded. \"Hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down, darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat. I turned to Jorja. \"So, you\u0027re an actress. What have you done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, vaguely, \"Different things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was taken aback by her response. Actresses usually could not wait to tell producers their credits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at her more closely. There was something magnetic about her. She was a beauty, with classical features and deep, intelligent brown eyes, filled with promise. Her voice was husky and distinctive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t you two come up to my office when you\u0027re through with lunch?\" I suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d love to, darling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJorja said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the way to my office, I stopped to see Jerry Davis, my close friend who was a writer on the lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jerry, I just met the woman I\u0027m going to marry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is she? I\u0027d like to meet her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no, not yet. I don\u0027t need the competition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifteen minutes later, Zsa Zsa and Jorja came to my office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, sit down,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe chatted idly for a few minutes. Finally, I said to Jorja, \"If you\u0027re not seeing anyone, why don\u0027t we have dinner one night?\" I picked up a pen. \"What\u0027s your phone number?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m very busy,\" Jorja said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZsa Zsa looked at Jorja in horror. \"Don\u0027t be a fool, darling. Sidney\u0027s a producer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Jorja said, \"I\u0027m not interested in - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZsa Zsa spoke up and gave me Jorja\u0027s telephone number. Jorja glared at her, obviously upset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just a dinner,\" I said to Jorja. \"I\u0027ll call you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJorja got up. \"It was nice meeting you, Mr. Sheldon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could feel the chill in the room. I watched as the two of them left. This is not going to be easy, I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up Jorja Curtright\u0027s credits. They were formidable. She had appeared in television, motion pictures, and on Broadway. She had just starred as Stella on a road tour of the Broadway hit A Streetcar Named Desire. The reviewers were ecstatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe New York Times said, \"As \u0027Stella,\u0027 Jorja Curtright is superb - energetic and decisive in her analysis of the part and glowing with warmth, pity and understanding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had also gotten great reviews for the movie Whistle Stop and a dozen important television shows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI telephoned Jorja the next morning and invited her to dinner. She said, \"I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027m busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI telephoned her for the next four days and got the same answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the fifth day, I called and said, \"I\u0027m giving a dinner party Friday night. There are going to be a lot of important producers and directors here. I think it might be helpful for your career for you to meet them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long, long pause. \"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had the feeling that she had accepted because the two of us were not going to be alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I had to begin putting together a dinner party with important producers and directors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow I managed to pull it off. A few of the producers and directors who were there had seen Jorja\u0027s work and were very flattering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the evening was over I said to Jorja, \"Did you enjoy yourself tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll drive you home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"I have my car. Thank you for a lovely evening.\" She started to head for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute,\" I said. \"Will you have dinner with me one night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about it. \"All right.\" There was a definite lack of enthusiasm in her answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called her the following morning. \"Are you free for dinner this evening?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time she said, \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll pick you up, seven-thirty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had dinner at Chasen\u0027s. My experience was that when having a conversation with an actress, the talk usually consisted of: \"So I said to the director . . .\" and \"I told the cameraman . . .\" and \"My leading man . . .\" Dinner with an actress was all about show business. With Jorja, show business was not even mentioned. She talked about her family and friends. She had come from a small town - Mena, Arkansas - and still had her small-town roots. She was the antithesis of any actress I had ever met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs we came to the end of the dinner, I said, \"Jorja, why were you so reluctant to go out with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated. \"Do you want a straight answer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have the reputation of dating too many women. I don\u0027t intend to be just another one on your list.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"You\u0027re not just another one. Why don\u0027t you give me a chance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe studied me a moment. \"All right. We\u0027ll see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI began seeing Jorja every evening. The more I saw of her, the more I knew that I was in love. She had a wonderful, wicked sense of humor, and we laughed a lot. We became closer and closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of three months, I took her in my arms and said, \"Let\u0027s get married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe eloped to Vegas the next day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI arranged for Natalie and Marty to come to Hollywood to meet Jorja, and they all got along beautifully. Natalie asked Jorja a hundred questions, then decided that she was thrilled for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI planned a honeymoon for us in Europe. I had bought a small house off Coldwater Canyon in Beverly Hills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtto and his wife, Ann, were living in Los Angeles, and when I told Otto the news about Jorja, he clapped me on the shoulder and said, \"That\u0027s wonderful. I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027m going to do. As a wedding gift, I\u0027m going to put siding on your house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOtto\u0027s latest occupation was the siding business, putting aluminum siding on the outside of houses. It was a generous gift because siding was expensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great. Thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told Kenneth McKenna that I was taking three months off, and Jorja and I sailed to Europe. It was a dream honeymoon that included a tour of London, Paris, Rome, and one of my favorite places in the world - Venice. I had never been happier. The dark cloud was behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, it was time to return home. When we arrived back in Los Angeles, Otto was waiting for us. As we drove up to our house, he said, \"I think you\u0027re going to love this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was right. The house looked beautiful, completely covered with shiny aluminum siding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\". . . And I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027m going to do,\" Otto added magnanimously. \"I\u0027m going to give you this at cost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJorja was doing a lot of television. She seemed to go from one top show to another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne night, Jorja had a dream that she was making an impassioned speech to save the life of a man a crowd was about to lynch. She woke up in the middle of the dream and sat straight up in bed. She enjoyed her speech so much that she finished it, wide awake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack at MGM, late in the spring of 1952, I found a project that I liked. It was called \"Dream Wife,\" a short story written by Alfred Levitt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plot was about the battle of the sexes. A bachelor was engaged to a beautiful State Department official who was too busy with an oil crisis in the Middle East to have time to marry him. Fed up, he decides to marry a beautiful young princess he met in the Middle East. Because of the world oil crisis, complications begin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI brought an aspiring young writer, Herbert Baker, in to work with me on the screenplay. The writing went well. I had Cary Grant in mind as the leading man, but I knew how busy his schedule was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I was involved in a project, I became so absorbed that time had no meaning for me. One evening, I was working late at the studio when I got an idea for a scene that excited me. I picked up the telephone and phoned Herbert Baker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get over here right away,\" I said. \"I have an idea you\u0027re going to love.\" I hung up and I kept working.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later, Herbert Baker still had not arrived. I decided to call him again. As I reached for the phone, I looked at my watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was four o\u0027clock in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the Dream Wife screenplay was finally finished, I was ready to start casting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who do you want?\" the casting department asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did not even hesitate. \"My dream cast would be Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll see what we can do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe screenplay was sent to Cary and I got an answer five days later. \"Cary loves the script. He\u0027ll do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was thrilled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He gave us a list of directors he\u0027ll work with, I\u0027ll start checking them out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bad news came the next day. \"All of Cary\u0027s choices are busy directing other movies. Why don\u0027t you talk to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI arranged to have lunch with Cary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cary, we have a problem. The directors you want are not available. What do you want us to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought it over. \"I know who should direct this picture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was relieved. \"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe? I shook my head. \"Cary, I\u0027ve never directed before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know how your mind works. I want you to direct it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was obviously going to be a fantastic year for me. How high could an elevator go?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to see Dore Schary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cary wants me to direct Dream Wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDore Schary nodded. \"He called me. If that\u0027s what he wants, fine. You\u0027re the director.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like a miracle to me. A few short years ago I had been an usher, watching these glamorous, unreachable stars on the screen. And now I was writing for them, producing, directing them, touching their lives as they had once touched mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was ecstatic. I was joining the roster of all of the talented directors who had worked with Cary - Alfred Hitchcock in Suspicion and Notorious, George Cukor in Holiday and The Philadelphia Story, Leo McCarey in The Awful Truth and Once Upon a Honeymoon, and Howard Hawks in Bringing Up Baby and His Girl Friday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute, Sidney,\" Dore said. \"This would make you the writer, director, and producer. You really don\u0027t need all those credits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to look at him. \"What did you have in mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t I put my name on as producer,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt made no difference to me. I nodded. \"No problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a decision that would almost destroy my career.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe began casting. Walter Pidgeon was signed to the cast, but we were having trouble finding the Middle East princess. I had heard about an actress named Betta St. John, who was in London, starring in South Pacific.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flew over there to make a test of her. She was perfect for the part and I signed her for the movie. When I returned to the studio, there was a message that Harry Cohn had called. I returned the call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sheldon, I understand that you\u0027re going to direct a picture with Cary Grant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cary Grant is a killer. He likes to run things. Why do you think he picked you to direct the movie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because he thinks I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s setting you up. He figures that with an inexperienced director, he can get away with murder. Remember this, Sheldon. There can only be one director on a picture. Tell him that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had no intention of telling him that. \"Thanks, Harry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCary was coming to the house for lunch the following day. I thought about what I was going to say to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to thank you for being such a good friend . . . I want to thank you for your faith in me . . . I want to thank you for giving me an opportunity like this . . . I\u0027m counting on you to give me all the help you can. I know you won\u0027t let me make a fool of myself . . . Working with you is going to be wonderful . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCary walked in, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand you found our princess in London,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. She\u0027ll be great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCary sat down, and I heard myself saying, \"I have to talk to you, Cary. There can only be one director on a picture. I want us to be clear on that before we begin. Agreed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had had no intention of saying any of that to one of the biggest stars in the world, who was also my friend. At times, without any warning, you will lose control of your words and actions. Cary could have had me fired from the movie in about ten seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat there, looking at me, without a word. Then, after a few moments, he surprised me by saying, \"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trouble began before we even started shooting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCary walked onto the soundstage one morning and stopped before one of the sets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"If I had known it was going to look like this, I never would have agreed to do the picture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I cut three unnecessary lines from the script, Cary said, \"If I had known you were going to cut those lines, I would never have agreed to do this picture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw the wardrobe he was to wear. \"If I had known they expected me to wear this, I never would have agreed to do this picture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night before we began to shoot, Deborah Kerr called me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sidney, I just want to tell you that Cary said the two of us should gang up on you. I told him I won\u0027t do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Deborah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat have I gotten myself into?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen shooting started the next morning, Cary flubbed his first scene.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"Cut - \" and Cary turned on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t ever say \u0027cut\u0027 when I\u0027m in the middle of a scene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone on the soundstage could hear him. The harassment went on that way, and in the late afternoon, I said to my assistant director, \"This is the last scene. I\u0027m quitting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t quit. Give it a chance. Cary will calm down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCary did, but every day he managed, in little ways, to try to test me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a scene between Cary and Deborah, she was explaining to Cary that they could not have dinner together because she had to go to the Middle East on State Department business. Deborah started to say her lines to Cary, and she began to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cut,\" I said. \"Let\u0027s try it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camera began to roll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry I can\u0027t have dinner with you,\" Deborah said. \"I have to go to - \" She began to burst into laughter again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cut.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked up to the two of them. \"What\u0027s the problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCary said, innocently, \"No problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" I told him. \"Do the scene with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe began the scene. I said, \"I\u0027m sorry I can\u0027t have dinner with you but - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCary was looking at me with such overpowering intensity that I began to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cary,\" I said, \"don\u0027t do that. Let\u0027s get this scene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"All right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom then on, that scene went well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe finished the day\u0027s shooting and I was happy with the result. Deborah was enormously talented and she and Cary were wonderful together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCary was married to a young actress named Betsy Drake, with whom he had done a movie. Every evening, after each day\u0027s shooting, as Cary and I left the soundstage, Jorja and Betsy would be waiting outside for us. Cary would take Jorja\u0027s arm and begin complaining about what I had done that day. I would take Betsy\u0027s arm and complain about Cary\u0027s behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day, while shooting a scene with Walter Pidgeon, Cary moved his eyebrows up and down like Groucho Marx.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cut! Cary, what are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was all innocence. \"I\u0027m doing the scene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do it without your eyebrows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Action.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scene started again and so did the eyebrows. It was so ridiculous that it broke me up. I was behind the camera. I did not want to spoil the scene, so I bit my hand to keep from laughing aloud. I had made no sound, but in the middle of the scene, Cary, whose back was to me, turned and said, \"Sidney, if you\u0027re going to laugh like that, I can\u0027t do the scene.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCary and I reached a kind of detente. The fact was that we liked each other too much to carry on a feud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day, Elvis Presley came on the set to watch us shooting. He was at the height of his popularity and I had no idea what to expect. He turned out to be extraordinarily polite and modest. It was \"Mr. Sheldon\" and \"Yes, sir\" and \"No, sir.\" Everyone was very taken with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat happened to him later on in his life was dreadful. He was on drugs, and ruined his voice, and grew fat and unattractive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he died, some cynic said, \"Good career move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we finished shooting, Cary and I had lunch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCary said, \"Sidney, anytime you want to direct me in another movie, just tell me. I don\u0027t even have to read the script.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was enormously flattering coming from a star who was eagerly sought after by every studio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDore and the rest of the executives saw the finished picture and were ecstatic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDore said to me, \"I have great news. Radio City Music Hall has accepted the picture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was thrilled. It was a director\u0027s dream to get into the prestigious Radio City Music Hall, and I had done it with the first picture I directed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m proud of you,\" Dore said. \"You did a great job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEddie Mannix spoke up. \"Gentlemen, we have a hit on our hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoward Strickling, head of publicity, agreed. \"This calls for a big publicity campaign.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDore smiled. \"Let\u0027s get started.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator was at the top floor. Nothing could go wrong. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-other-side-of-me/page-22.html","bookId":2371,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:27 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:27 AM"}
