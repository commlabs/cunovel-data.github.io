At dusk of a summer’s evening it was a veritable cup of twilight and silence.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Even in summer, when the sky was blue above, when the wild strawberries were in their glory and the hills were hazy with heat, there was something strangely melancholy about this tiny valley, with the little cottage nestling in its heart.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There were days in the long winter of Cumberland when the valley and the cottage seen from above, presented a picture dreary to the point of being tragic.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The high road, at the foot of the fells, was scarcely a quarter of a mile away, yet the cottage was quite invisible from it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Arol-Johnston car, with its single occupant, drew up on the road level with the unseen cottage. Sir Anthony Gyde descended, and leaving the car to take care of itself, opened the gate, passed through, and struck up the rising ground.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was not a breath of wind, the air was keen with frost, there was not a living thing in sight, save in the sky, far up, under the cold grey clouds, a hawk poised, now moving with a flutter of the wings, now motionless as a stone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One might stand here seemingly unseen; it would have appeared that one might commit any act, unseen by eye, save the eye of God. Yet far up the fell, so small a figure as to be unnoticeable, a boy, Robert Lewthwaite, son of a shoe-maker in Blencarn, attracted by the hum of the approaching car on the high road far below, was watching.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e From that elevation he could see the car approaching; he saw it stop and the occupant get out. He recognized him at once as Sir Anthony Gyde. He saw him cross the field and enter the little valley.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Here Sir Anthony looked around him, sweeping the fell face as though to see if he were observed. Apparently satisfied, he knocked at the cottage door; the door was opened for him, he entered, and the door was closed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All this vastly interested the boy. Klein, the German artist, had greatly exercised the local mind. A man whose face and personality would have drawn attention in a city, excited the deepest interest among these primitive folk.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Primitive, perhaps, but full of imagination, and more than ordinarily speculative.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He, too, like Sir Anthony Gyde, had been labelled a stracklin; besides being a stracklin he was “Waugh.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e No boy in the village would have approached Skirle Cottage after dark. There was something about its occupant that fascinated them, but it was a fascination composed three parts of fear.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He cooked his own food, and though the food he cooked was the food he bought from the village shop and the surrounding farms, there were sinister suspicions in the minds of the young people in the neighbourhood that he cooked and ate other things besides eggs and bacon and fell mutton.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e An old woman of the village, Mrs Braithwaite, called every day at noon to clean up the place and make the bed (Klein was a late riser, another suspicious point about him), and her tales about the artist and his doings did not detract from the villagers’ pre-conceived impressions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She declared, at times, that he was enough to “mak’ t’ flesh creep up yan’s back to think on,” but he paid her five shillings a week, and as money was scarce in the Braithwaite household, and the work to be done at Skirle Cottage occupied only half an hour or so a day, she kept on with the job.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was, besides the money, a sort of eerie fascination about the stranger that was not entirely distasteful to the old lady’s heart.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Once, a small boy named Britten, greatly daring, had peeped through the window at the ogre. The door opened and the ogre came out, and Britten ran, returning home drenched, and with the following lucid description of the incident and the cause of his wetting. “He chased me an’ I rin, ah catcht mi teea ower a cobble and down ah went, end-ower-end inta the beck.” So it was not surprising that Bob Lewthwaite, seeing Sir Anthony Gyde going in to the ogre’s cottage and the door closing upon him, waited, forgetting everything else in the world, to see what was going to happen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He waited a long time, nearly three-quarters of an hour, then the door opened and Sir Anthony Gyde came out.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He was carrying a black bag in his hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He closed the door and looked around him, just as he had done before entering. Satisfied, apparently, that he was unobserved, he came down the valley towards the road, got into the motor-car and drove off.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1933/55466.html","bookId":775,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 10:43:53 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 10:43:53 AM"}
