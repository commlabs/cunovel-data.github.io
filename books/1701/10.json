He had never known that other books existed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this room\u0027s walls were completely covered by bookcases, filled, which reached to the ceiling. There must have been hundreds—perhaps thousands—of books, their titles embossed in shiny letters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas stared at them. He couldn\u0027t imagine what the thousands of pages contained. Could there be rules beyond the rules that governed the community? Could there be more descriptions of offices and factories and committees?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had only a second to look around because he was aware that the man sitting in a chair beside the table was watching him. Hastily he moved forward, stood before the man, bowed slightly, and said, \"I\u0027m Jonas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. Welcome, Receiver of Memory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas recognized the man. He was the Elder who had seemed separate from the others at the Ceremony, though he was dressed in the same special clothing that only Elders wore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas looked self-consciously into the pale eyes that mirrored his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir, I apologize for my lack of understanding....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited, but the man did not give the standard accepting-of-apology response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment, Jonas went on, \"But I thought—I mean I think,\" he corrected, reminding himself that if precision of language were ever to be important, it was certainly important now, in the presence of this man, \"that you are the receiver of Memory. I\u0027m only, well, I was only assigned, I mean selected, yesterday. I\u0027m not anything at all. Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man looked at him thoughtfully, silently. It was a look that combined interest, curiosity, concern, and perhaps a little sympathy as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally he spoke. \"Beginning today, this moment, at least to me, you are The Receiver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have been The Receiver for a long time. A very, very long time. You can see that, can\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas nodded. The man was wrinkled, and his eyes, though piercing in their unusual lightness, seemed tired. The flesh around them was darkened into shadowed circles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can see that you are very old,\" Jonas responded with respect. The Old were always given the highest respect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man smiled. He touched the sagging flesh on his own face with amusement. \"I am not, actually, as old as I look,\" he told Jonas. \"This job has aged me. I know I look as if I should be scheduled for release very soon. But actually I have a good deal of time left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was pleased, though, when you were selected. It took them a long time. The failure of the previous selection was ten years ago, and my energy is starting to diminish. I need what strength I have remaining for your training. We have hard and painful work to do, you and I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please sit down,\" he said, and gestured toward the nearby chair. Jonas lowered himself onto the soft cushioned seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man closed his eyes and continued speaking. \"When I became a Twelve, I was selected, as you were. I was frightened, as I\u0027m sure you are.\" He opened his eyes for a moment and peered at Jonas, who nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eyes closed again. \"I came to this very room to begin my training. It was such a long time ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The previous Receiver seemed just as old to me as I do to you. He was just as tired as I am today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat forward suddenly, opened his eyes, and said, \"You may ask questions. I have so little experience in describing this process. It is forbidden to talk of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, sir. I have read the instructions,\" Jonas said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I may neglect to make things as clear as I should.\" The man chuckled. \"My job is important and has enormous honor. But that does not mean I am perfect, and when I tried before to train a successor, I failed. Please ask any questions that will help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his mind, Jonas had questions. A thousand. A million questions. As many questions as there were books lining the walls. But he did not ask one, not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man sighed, seeming to put his thoughts in order. Then he spoke again. \"Simply stated,\" he said, \"although it\u0027s not really simple at all, my job is to transmit to you all the memories I have within me. Memories of the past.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir,\" Jonas said tentatively, \"I would be very interested to hear the story of your life, and to listen to your memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I apologize for interrupting,\" he added quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man waved his hand impatiently. \"No apologies in this room. We haven\u0027t time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Jonas went on, uncomfortably aware that he might be interrupting again, \"I am really interested, I don\u0027t mean that I\u0027m not. But I don\u0027t exactly understand why it\u0027s so important. I could do some adult job in the community, and in my recreation time I could come and listen to the stories from your childhood. I\u0027d like that. Actually,\" he added, \"I\u0027ve done that already, in the House of the Old. The Old like to tell about their childhoods, and it\u0027s always fun to listen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man shook his head. \"No, no,\" he said. \"I\u0027m not being clear. It\u0027s not my past, not my childhood that I must transmit to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned back, resting his head against the back of the upholstered chair. \"It\u0027s the memories of the whole world,\" he said with a sigh. \"Before you, before me, before the previous Receiver, and generations before him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas frowned. \"The whole world?\" he asked. \"I don\u0027t understand. Do you mean not just us? Not just the community? Do you mean Elsewhere, too?\" He tried, in his mind, to grasp the concept. \"I\u0027m sorry, sir. I don\u0027t understand exactly. Maybe I\u0027m not smart enough. I don\u0027t know what you mean when you say \u0027the whole world\u0027 or \u0027generations before him.\u0027 I thought there was only us. I thought there was only now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s much more. There\u0027s all that goes beyond—all that is Elsewhere—and all that goes back, and back, and back. I received all of those, when I was selected. And here in this room, all alone, I re-experience them again and again. It is how wisdom comes. And how we shape our future.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rested for a moment, breathing deeply. \"I am so weighted with them,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas felt a terrible concern for the man, suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s as if...\" The man paused, seeming to search his mind for the right words of description. \"It\u0027s like going downhill through deep snow on a sled,\" he said, finally. \"At first it\u0027s exhilarating: the speed; the sharp, clear air; but then the snow accumulates, builds up on the runners, and you slow, you have to push hard to keep going, and—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head suddenly, and peered at Jonas. \"That meant nothing to you, did it?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas was confused. \"I didn\u0027t understand it, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you didn\u0027t. You don\u0027t know what snow is, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or a sled? Runners?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir,\" Jonas said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Downhill? The term means nothing to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s a place to start. I\u0027d been wondering how to begin. Move to the bed, and lie face down. Remove your tunic first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas did so, a little apprehensively. Beneath his bare chest, he felt the soft folds of the magnificent cloth that covered the bed. He watched as the man rose and moved first to the wall where the speaker was. It was the same sort of speaker that occupied a place in every dwelling, but one thing about it was different. This one had a switch, which the man deftly snapped to the end that said OFF.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas almost gasped aloud. To have the power to turn the speaker off! It was an astonishing thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the man moved with surprising quickness to the corner where the bed was. He sat on a chair beside Jonas, who was motionless, waiting for what would happen next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Close your eyes. Relax. This will not be painful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas remembered that he was allowed, that he had even been encouraged, to ask questions. \"What are you going to do, sir?\" he asked, hoping that his voice didn\u0027t betray his nervousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am going to transmit the memory of snow,\" the old man said, and placed his hands on Jonas\u0027s bare back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas felt nothing unusual at first. He felt only the light touch of the old man\u0027s hands on his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to relax, to breathe evenly. The room was absolutely silent, and for a moment Jonas feared that he might disgrace himself now, on the first day of his training, by falling asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he shivered. He realized that the touch of the hands felt, suddenly, cold. At the same instant, breathing in, he felt the air change, and his very breath was cold. He licked his lips, and in doing so, his tongue touched the suddenly chilled air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was very startling; but he was not at all frightened, now. He was filled with energy, and he breathed again, feeling the sharp intake of frigid air. Now, too, he could feel cold air swirling around his entire body. He felt it blow against his hands where they lay at his sides, and over his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe touch of the man\u0027s hands seemed to have disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he became aware of an entirely new sensation: pinpricks? No, because they were soft and without pain. Tiny, cold, featherlike feelings peppered his body and face. He put out his tongue again, and caught one of the dots of cold upon it. It disappeared from his awareness instantly; but he caught another, and another. The sensation made him smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne part of his consciousness knew that he was still lying there, on the bed, in the Annex room. Yet another, separate part of his being was upright now, in a sitting position, and beneath him he could feel that he was not on the soft decorated bedcovering at all, but rather seated on a flat, hard surface. His hands now held (though at the same time they were still motionless at his sides) a rough, damp rope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he could see, though his eyes were closed. He could see a bright, whirling torrent of crystals in the air around him, and he could see them gather on the backs of his hands, like cold fur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis breath was visible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond, through the swirl of what he now, somehow, perceived was the thing the old man had spoken of—snow—he could look out and down a great distance. He was up high someplace. The ground was thick with the furry snow, but he sat slightly above it on a hard, flat object.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSled, he knew abruptly. He was sitting on a thing called sled. And the sled itself seemed to be poised at the top of a long, extended mound that rose from the very land where he was. Even as he thought the word \"mound,\" his new consciousness told him hill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the sled, with Jonas himself upon it, began to move through the snowfall, and he understood instantly that now he was going downhill. No voice made an explanation. The experience explained itself to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face cut through the frigid air as he began the descent, moving through the substance called snow on the vehicle called sled, which propelled itself on what he now knew without doubt to be runners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComprehending all of those things as he sped downward, he was free to enjoy the breathless glee that overwhelmed him: the speed, the clear cold air, the total silence, the feeling of balance and excitement and peace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, as the angle of incline lessened, as the mound—the hill—flattened, nearing the bottom, the sled\u0027s forward motion slowed. The snow was piled now around it, and he pushed with his body, moving it forward, not wanting the exhilarating ride to end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally the obstruction of the piled snow was too much for the thin runners of the sled, and he came to a stop. He sat there for a moment, panting, holding the rope in his cold hands. Tentatively he opened his eyes—not his snow-hill-sled eyes, for they had been open throughout the strange ride. He opened his ordinary eyes, and saw that he was still on the bed, that he had not moved at all. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-giver-the-giver-quartet-1/page-10.html","bookId":1701,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:59:13 AM"}
