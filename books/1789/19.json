He noticed Colin had his arm around Alesandra\u0027s shoulders and added, \"He can\u0027t keep his hands off her as it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, Henry…\" his wife pleaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mind\u0027s set, Gweneth. You may invite a few close friends if you\u0027re wanting to, but that is the only concession I\u0027ll allow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Father,\" Colin said. \"I don\u0027t want the news of the marriage to get out until it\u0027s over. It\u0027s safer for Alesandra that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father nodded. \"I\u0027d forgotten,\" he admitted. \"Yes, it would be safer. All right then, only the immediate family will be here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his full attention to Alesandra. \"I want your agreement to wed Colin,\" he commanded. \"And I want it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you agree?\" Colin asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d won and he knew it. She slowly nodded. Colin leaned down and kissed her. She was so startled by the show of affection she didn\u0027t pull away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s quite enough of that,\" Henry snapped. \"You won\u0027t be touching her again until you\u0027re married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlesandra turned to Colin. \"You\u0027re going to regret marrying me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t seem overly worried about that possibility. He wouldn\u0027t have winked at her if he\u0027d really been concerned. Jenkins appeared in the doorway. \"Begging your pardon, your grace, but we have a visitor at the door. Sir Richards is requesting an immediate audience with your son, Colin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Show him into the salon, Jenkins,\" Colin called out. \"Why would the director of security be wanting to see you?\" his father demanded to know. \"You told me you\u0027d quit the department.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe worry in his voice confused Alesandra. She started to ask her guardian why he was so concerned, but just as she opened her mouth to say something, Colin tightened his hold on her shoulders. She turned to look at him. His expression didn\u0027t give anything away and she knew no one else at the table realized he was silently ordering her to remain quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After what happened to your leg, I can\u0027t imagine why you would continue working for the director,\" his mother interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin tried to hold on to his patience. \"The director had nothing to do with my injury.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a long time ago,\" Jade reminded the duchess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By God, he\u0027s finished with that cloak-and-dagger business,\" his father announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine leaned forward, drawing Colin\u0027s attention. \"Why exactly is Richards here?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I requested his help,\" Colin answered. \"And he was also going to gather some information for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Regarding?\" Caine asked. \"Alesandra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir father looked relieved. \"Well, then, that\u0027s quite all right. Yes, Richards is just the man to ask about the general.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShall we go into the salon and hear what he has to tell us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We aren\u0027t going to be left out, Henry,\" his wife announced. She stood up to face her husband. \"Come along, Jade. You, too, Alesandra. If the matter concerns one of us, it concerns all of us. Isn\u0027t that right, Henry?\" Then she and the others left the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin let go of Alesandra. She stood up when he did. She caught hold of his hand before he could leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your father now believes I\u0027m a trollop,\" she whispered. \"I would appreciate it if you would set him straight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin leaned down close to her ear. \"I\u0027ll explain everything after we\u0027re married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis warm breath sent a shiver of pleasure down her neck, making it difficult for her to concentrate. Up until an hour ago, when Colin had kissed her so passionately, she\u0027d been desperately trying to think of him as a friend… or a cousin. She\u0027d been lying to herself, of course, but, damn it all, it was working. Colin had turned the tables on her, though, when he\u0027d touched her. Now, just standing so close to him made her heartbeat race. He smelled so wonderful, so masculine, and… Oh, Lord, she really needed to get hold of her thoughts. \"You\u0027re a scoundrel, Colin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like to think I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave up trying to make him angry. \"Why don\u0027t you want your family to know you\u0027re working for…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wouldn\u0027t let her finish. His mouth covered hers in a quick, hard kiss. She let out a little sigh when he pulled back, then repeated her question. He kissed her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe finally got his message and quit her questions. \"Will you explain after we\u0027re married?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade walked back into the dining room. \"Colin, I would like to speak to Alesandra in private. We\u0027ll be along in a minute.\" Alesandra waited until Colin had left the dining room, then went around the table to stand next to Jade. \"Do you really dislike the idea of marrying Colin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Alesandra answered. \"And that, you see, is the problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is it a problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Colin\u0027s being forced into marrying me. He\u0027s acting out of duty. I can\u0027t control that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand,\" Jade remarked. Alesandra brushed her hair back over her shoulder in a nervous gesture. \"I wanted to control the situation,\" she whispered. When it first became apparent I would have to get married, I was very angry inside. I felt so… powerless. It didn\u0027t seem fair. I finally came to terms with my circumstances, however, as soon as I began to think of the marriage as a business transaction and not a personal relationship. I decided that if I chose my husband and set my own terms, then it wouldn\u0027t matter if he loved me or not. It would be a business arrangement, nothing more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Colin won\u0027t agree to your terms, though, will he? I\u0027m not surprised,\" Jade remarked. \"He\u0027s an independent man. He\u0027s proud of the fact that he\u0027s making it on his own, without help from family or friends. He isn\u0027t going to be easy to control, but in time I believe you\u0027ll be happy about that. Have some faith in him, Alesandra. He\u0027ll take care of you.\" Yes, Alesandra thought to herself. Colin would take care of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she would become a burden to him. He wasn\u0027t interested in her inheritance and in fact had made it perfectly clear he wouldn\u0027t touch it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t impressed with her title, either. Being married to a princess was going to be a nuisance because he would have to suffer going to several important functions during the year. He\u0027d have to mingle with the prince regent, and, Lord, she knew he\u0027d hate that. Colin had rejected everything she had to offer. No, it wasn\u0027t a fair exchange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSir Richards had just finished greeting everyone when Jade and Alesandra walked into the salon. The director turned to both ladies. He knew Jade, and after telling her how wonderful it was to see her again, he turned his full attention to Alesandra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Henry told me the good news. Congratulations, Princess. You\u0027ve chosen a fine man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlesandra forced a smile. She thanked the director, agreed Colin was indeed a fine man, and asked him if he would be attending the wedding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Sir Richards replied. \"I wouldn\u0027t miss it It\u0027s a pity it has to be kept a secret, but you understand well enough the reasons. Come and sit down now. I\u0027ve some information you\u0027ll be interested in hearing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSir Richards ushered her over to one of the settees. Jade and Caine were seated across from her, and the duke and duchess took the third settee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin stood alone in front of the hearth. He wasn\u0027t paying any attention to the director or his family. His back was turned to the gathering and he was intently studying the miniature on the mantel. Alesandra watched Colin as he lifted the castle to get a better look at it. The expression on Colin\u0027s face was masked, and she wondered what he was thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe duchess was explaining her plans for the wedding. She was determined to make the intimate affair as lovely as possible. She was interrupted by her husband when he called out to Colin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be careful with that, son. It\u0027s priceless to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin nodded but he didn\u0027t turn around. He had just noticed the tiny drawbridge latched with a delicate-looking chain. \"This really is a piece of workmanship,\" he remarked as he gently pried the drawbridge away from the hook. The door immediately dropped down. Colin lifted the castle higher so that he could look inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlesandra saw the surprised look in his eyes. He smiled, too. She smiled in reaction. He had just figured out the bit of trickery her father had played on his friend so many years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin turned to Caine and motioned to him with a quick tilt of his head. Caine stood up and walked over to the mantel. Colin didn\u0027t say a word to his brother. He simply handed him the castle, then turned and walked over to sit next to Alesandra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe duchess had only just warmed to her topic of the wedding plans. Both her husband and the director were patiently listening to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine suddenly let out a hoot of laughter. He drew everyone\u0027s attention, of course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine turned to Alesandra. \"Did you know about this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. \"My mother told me the story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Later, when you\u0027re alone with Father, would you show him?\" Caine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put that down,\" his father ordered. \"It makes me nervous to see it handled. Do you have any idea of its value, Caine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis son laughed. \"Yes, father, I understand its value.\" He closed the drawbridge and put the castle back where it belonged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother, I don\u0027t believe Sir Richards is interested in your plans for the wedding,\" Colin said. \"He\u0027s been polite long enough. Let him get to his reason for calling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGweneth turned to the director. \"Were you just being polite?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course he was, Gweneth,\" her husband told her. He softened his bluntness by patting his wife\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine had returned to his seat next to his wife. He put his arm around her shoulders and pulled her close to his side. Alesandra noticed that both her guardian and his eldest son were very open in showing their affection for their wives. Caine was stroking his wife\u0027s arm in an absent-minded way and her uncle Henry hadn\u0027t let go of his wife\u0027s hand. Alesandra envied the loving couples. She knew it had been a true love match between her guardian and his wife, and from the way Jade and Caine looked at each other, she assumed they had also fallen in love before they were married.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and Colin were another matter altogether. She wondered if he realized what he was giving up to marry her and almost asked him that question then and there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSir Richards saved her from embarrassing herself when he took the floor. \"Colin asked me to assist him with a little experiment. He had reason to believe the lady\u0027s maid, Valena, was in a league with the ruffians trying to snatch the princess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlesandra was stunned by the director\u0027s explanation. She turned to Colin. \"What reason would you have to distrust that sweet…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe interrupted her. \"Let him finish, Alesandra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Colin was correct,\" Sir Richards announced. He smiled at his host. \"Both your sons have the best instincts I\u0027ve ever come across in all my days working for the department.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry beamed with pleasure. \"It\u0027s a trait I like to think they inherited from me,\" he remarked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Gweneth agreed. Her loyalty to her husband was absolute. \"Henry\u0027s always been as cunning as a lion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin tried not to smile. He believed his father was more like a lamb than a lion, but he didn\u0027t see that as a flaw. In truth, he envied his innocence. He\u0027d lost his own years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis father was a rare man indeed. He seemed to be immune to the darker side of life. Having heard his father\u0027s confession of the dark period he went through when he was a younger man made him all the more remarkable. The experience hadn\u0027t made him cynical. He wore his heart on his sleeve most of the time, and Colin knew that if there was any softness at all left in his own nature, it had come from his father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, then, as I was saying,\" the director continued. \"Colin told the maid to inform the princess that there would be a meeting at my town house. He set the time for ten the following morning. Valena slipped out during the night to tell her companions. Colin had one of Alesandra\u0027s guards follow her. Right as rain the following morning, there they were, four in all, hiding in wait near my home to nab the princess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So there were four in all?\" Colin asked. He wasn\u0027t at all surprised by the news. Alesandra was speechless. She had always believed she was a good judge of character but now admitted she\u0027d certainly been off the mark with Valena. Alesandra\u0027s thoughts immediately turned to Victoria and she wondered if she\u0027d been wrong about her, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good heavens, I hired Valena,\" the duchess blurted out. \"She came to me and I should have thought that odd, but I was so pleased with her because she was born near Alesandra\u0027s father\u0027s home. I thought it would make our ward feel more comfortable to have a reminder of her past. Valena spoke the language, you see. I looked into her references, Henry. Yes, I did, but now I realize I should have been more thorough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one\u0027s blaming you, Mother,\" Colin told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t you tell me about your suspicions?\" Alesandra asked Colin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was surprised by the question. \"Because it was my problem to solve, not yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked like he believed what he\u0027d just told her. Alesandra didn\u0027t know how to respond to that arrogant belief. \"But how did you know? What made you suspicious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The latch on one of the windows was unlocked an hour after Raymond had checked,\" he explained. \"And someone had to alert the men that we would be attending the opera.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The prince regent could have mentioned it to…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin cut her off. \"Yes, he could have,\" he agreed. \"But he wouldn\u0027t have unlocked the window.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you catch all of them?\" Henry asked the director then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, we did,\" Richards answered. \"They\u0027re safely tucked away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll talk to them first thing tomorrow,\" Colin announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I go with you?\" Alesandra asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColin\u0027s voice suggested she not argue. His father supported his son\u0027s decision, too. \"It\u0027s out of the question, Alesandra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe discussion was over. Sir Richards took his leave a few minutes later. Colin accompanied the director to the door. Jade and Caine said their farewells at the same time. Both the duke and duchess walked to the door with them. Alesandra stood by the hearth, watching the way the family members talked and laughed with one another, and the sudden yearning to be a part of the loving, close-knit family fairly overwhelmed her. She shook her head against the possibility. Colin wasn\u0027t marrying her because he loved her. She mustn\u0027t forget that, she told herself. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/castles-crown-s-spies-4/page-19.html","bookId":1789,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:08:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:08:33 PM"}
