SHORTY ON A HUNT","content":"GOES AFTER KNIGHTS OF THE GOLDEN CIRCLE.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e THAT evening, as Shorty was gathering his things together, preparatory for starting to the front the next morning, Lieut. Bigelow, one of the General\u0027s young Aids, thrust his head through the doorway and said gleefully:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Here, Corporal; I want you. I\u0027ve got a great lark. Our Secret Service people report a bad lodge of the Knights of the Golden Circle out here in the country that threatens to make trouble. It is made up of local scalawags and runaway rebels from Kentucky and Tennessee. They have a regular lodge-room in a log house out in the woods, which they have fixed up into a regular fort, and they hold their meetings at nights, with pickets thrown out, and no end of secrecy and mystery. The General thinks that they are some of the old counterfeiting, horse-stealing gang that infested the country, and are up to their old tricks. But it may be that they are planning wrecking a train, burning bridges and the like. They\u0027ve got so bold that the Sheriff and civil officials are afraid of them, and don\u0027t dare go near them. I\u0027ve persuaded the General to let me take out a squad and jump them. Want to go along?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m your huckleberry,\" said Shorty.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I knew you\u0027d be,\" answered the Lieutenant; \"so I got the General to let me have you. We\u0027ll get some 10 or 12 other good boys. That will be enough. I understand that there are about 100 regular attendants at the lodge, but they\u0027ll not all be there at any time, and a dozen of us can easily handle what we find there at home.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A dozen\u0027ll be a great plenty,\" assented Shorty. \"More\u0027d be in the way.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, go out and pick up that many of the right kind of boys, bring them here, and have them all ready by 10 o\u0027clock. You can find guns and ammunition for them in that room upstairs.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Shorty\u0027s first thought was of his old friend, Bob Ramsey, Sergeant of the Provost-Guard. He found him, and said:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"See here, Bob, I\u0027ve got something on hand better\u0027n roundin\u0027 up stragglers and squelchin\u0027 whisky rows. I\u0027ve got to pick out some men for a little raid, where there\u0027ll be a chance for a red-hot shindy. Want to go along?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You bet,\" answered the Sergeant. \"How many men do you want? I\u0027ll get \u0027em and go right along.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, you don\u0027t,\" answered Shorty. \"I\u0027m to be the non-commish of this crowd. A Lieutenant\u0027ll go along for style, but I\u0027ll run the thing.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But you\u0027re only a Corporal, while I\u0027m a Sergeant,\" protested Bob. \"\u0027Taint natural that you should go ahead of me. Why can\u0027t you and I run it together, you next to me? That\u0027s the correct thing.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, then,\" said Shorty, turning away, \"you stay and run your old Provo-Guard. This is my show, and I aint goin\u0027 to let nobody in it ahead o\u0027 me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Come, now, be reasonable,\" pleaded Bob. \"Why can\u0027t you and I go along together and run the thing? We\u0027ll pull together all right. You know I\u0027ve been a Sergeant for a long time, and know all about the handling of men.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, stay here and handle \u0027em. I\u0027ll handle the men that I take, all right. You kin gamble on that. And what I say to them has to go. Won\u0027t have nobody along that outranks me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well,\" answered Bob, with a gulp, \"let me go along, then, as a Corporal—I\u0027ll change my blouse and borrow a Corporal\u0027s—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Rankin\u0027 after me?\" inquired Shorty.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes; we had a Corporal promoted day before yesterday. I\u0027ll borrow his blouse.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Promoted day before yesterday,\" communed Shorty; \"and you won\u0027t presume to boss or command no more\u0027n he would?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not a mite,\" asserted Bob.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, then, you kin come along, and I\u0027ll be mighty glad to have you, for I know you\u0027re a standup feller and a good friend o\u0027 mine, and I always want to oblige a friend by lettin\u0027 him have a share in any good fight I have on hand.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jeff Wilson, the Chief Clerk, got wind of the expedition, and he too begged to be taken along, to which Shorty consented.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When Lieut. Bigelow came in at 10 o\u0027clock he found Shorty at the head of 12 good men, all armed and equipped, and eager for the service.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"In talking with the Secret Service men,\" explained the Lieutenant, \"they suggested that it would be well to have one good man, a stranger, dressed in citizen\u0027s clothes—butternut jeans, if possible—to go ahead at times and reconnoiter. He ought to be able to play off refugee rebel, if possible.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll do it. I\u0027m just the man,\" said Shorty eagerly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, just come in here,\" said the Lieutenant. \"Now, there\u0027s a lot of butternut jeans. I guess there\u0027s a pair of pantaloons long enough for you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When Shorty emerged from the room again there was a complete transformation. Except that his hair was cut close, he was a perfect reproduction of the tall, gaunt, slouching Tennesseean.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Perfect,\" said the Lieutenant, handing him a couple of heavy Remington revolvers. \"Stow these somewhere about your clothes, and get that blacking off your shoes as soon as you can, and you\u0027ll do.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was planned that they should sleep until near morning, when the spies of the Knights of the Golden Circle were not alert, enter a freight-car, which they would keep tightly shut, to escape observation, while the train ran all day toward a point within easy reach of their quarry. It would arrive there after dark, and so they hoped to catch the Knights entirely unawares, and in the full bloom of their audacity and pride.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The car which the squad entered was locked and sealed, and labeled, \"Perishable freight. Do not delay.\" Their presence was kept secret from all the train hands but the conductor, a man of known loyalty and discretion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Shorty being in disguise, it was decided that he should saunter down apart from the rest and take his place in the caboose. He lay down on the long seat, drew his slouch-hat over his eyes, and seemed to go to sleep. The train pulled out to the edge of the yard, went onto a switch and waited for the early morning accommodation to pass out and get the right-of-way.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A heavily-built, middle-aged man, whose coarse face had evidently been closely shaved a few days before, entered, carrying a large carpet-sack, which was well-filled and seemingly quite heavy. He set this carefully down on the seat, in the corner, walked up to the stove, warmed his hands, glanced sharply at Shorty, said \"Good morning,\" to which Shorty replied with a snore, took a plug of tobacco from his pocket, from which he cut a liberal chew with a long dirk that he opened by giving a skillful flip with his wrist, put the chew in his mouth, released the spring which held the blade in place, put both knife and tobacco in his pocket, and turning around spread the tails of his seedy black frock coat, and seemed lost in meditation as he warmed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Not a farmer, storekeeper or stock-buyer,\" Shorty mentally sized him up, \"Looks more like a hickory lawyer, herb-doctor or tin-horn gambler. What\u0027s he doin\u0027 in this caboose? Up to some devilment, no doubt. He\u0027ll bear watchin\u0027.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And Shorty gave another snore. The man, having completed his warming, sat down by his carpetsack, laid his arm across it to secure possession, pulled his battered silk hat down over his eyes, and tried to go to sleep.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The train rumbled out, and presently stopped at another station. Another man got on, also carrying a large, heavy carpet-sack. He was younger than the other, looked like a farm-hand, was dressed partly in homespun, partly in \"store-clothes,\" wore a weather-stained wool hat, and his sullen face terminated in a goatee. The first-comer looked him over an instant, and then said:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Were you out late last night?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I was,\" replied the second-comer, scanning his interrogator.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did you see a star?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I did.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What star was it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It was the Star of Bethlehem.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Right, my brother,\" responded the other, putting out his hand in a peculiar way for the grip of the order.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Shorty, still feigning deep sleep, pricked up his ears and drank in every word. He had heard before of the greeting formula by which Knights of the Golden Circle recognized one another, and he tried, with only partial success, to see the grip.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He saw the two men whisper together and tap their carpet-sacks significantly. They seemed to come to a familiar understanding at once, but they talked so low that Shorty could not catch their words, except once when the first-comer raised his voice to penetrate the din as they crossed a bridge, and did not lower it quickly enough after passing, and Shorty heard;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They\u0027ll all be certain to be there tonight.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And the other asked: \"And the raid\u0027ll be made ter-morrer?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The first-comer replied with a nod. At the next bridge the same thing occurred, and Shorty caught the words:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"They\u0027ve no idee. We\u0027ll ketch \u0027em clean offen their guard.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And the others\u0027ll come out?\" asked the second-comer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Certainly,\" said the first, lowering his voice again, but the look on his face and the way he pointed indicated to Shorty that he was saying that other lodges scattered through the neighborhood were only waiting the striking of the first blow to rise in force and march on Indianapolis, release the rebel prisoners there and carry havoc generally.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I see through it all,\" Shorty communed with himself. \"They\u0027re goin\u0027 to the same place that we are, and\u0027ve got them carpet-bags filled with revolvers and cartridges. Somebody\u0027s goin\u0027 to have a little surprise party before he\u0027s a day older.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The sun had now gotten so high that Shorty could hardly pretend to sleep longer. He gave a tremendous yawn and sat up. The older man regarded him attentively, the other sullenly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You must\u0027ve bin out late last night, stranger,\" said the first.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I was,\" answered Shorty, giving him a meaning look.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Did you see a star?\" inquired the older man.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I did,\" answered Shorty.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What star was it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The Star of Bethlehem,\" answered Shorty boldly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"\u0027You\u0027re right, my brother,\" said the man, putting out his hand for the grip. Shorty did the same, trying to imitate what he had seen. The car was lurching, and the grasp was imperfect. The man seemed only half satisfied. Shorty saw this, and with his customary impudence determined to put the onus of recognition on the other side. He drew his hand back as if disappointed, and turned a severe look upon the other man.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where are you from?\" asked the first-comer. Shorty curtly indicated the other side of the Ohio by a nod.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where are you goin\u0027?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Shorty\u0027s face put on a severe look, as if his questioner was too inquisitive. \"Jest up here to \u0027tend to some bizness,\" he answered briefly, and turned away as if to close the conversation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Say, I\u0027ve got a right to know something about you,\" said the first new-comer. \"I\u0027m Captain of this District, and have general charge o\u0027 things here, and men passin\u0027 through.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"All right,\" answered Shorty. \"Have general charge. I don\u0027t know you, and I have bizness with men who roost a good deal higher\u0027n you do.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He put his hands to his breast, as if assuring himself of the presence of important papers, and pulled out a little ways the official-looking envelope which contained his transportation and passes. This had its effect. The \"Captain\" weakened. \"Are you from the Southern army?\" he asked in a tone of respect.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Before I answer any o\u0027 your questions,\" said Shorty authoritatively, \"prove to me who you are.\" \"O, I kin do that quick enough,\" said the \"Captain\" eagerly, displaying on his vest the silver star, which was the badge of his rank, and his floridly printed commission and a badly-thumb-marked copy of the ritual of the Knights of the Golden Circle.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So far, so good,\" said Shorty. \"Now give me the grip.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Shorty, by watching the motions of the other\u0027s hand, was skillful enough to catch on to the grip this time, and get it exactly. He expressed himself satisfied, and as the car lay on the siding waiting for another train to arrive and pass he favored his two companions with one of his finest fictions about his home in Tennessee, his service in the rebel army, the number of Yankee Abolitionists he had slain with his own hand, and his present mission with important communications to those \"friends of the South in Illinois\" who were organizing a movement to stop the bloody and brutal war upon his beloved Southland.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His volubility excited that of the \"Captain,\" who related how he had been doing a prosperous business running a bar on a Lower Mississippi River boat, until Abolition fanaticism brought on the war; that he had then started a \"grocery\" in Jeffersonville, which the Provost-Marshal had wickedly suppressed, and now he was joining with others of his oppressed and patriotic fellow-citizens to stop the cruel and unnatural struggle against their brethren of the South.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And we shall do it,\" he said warmly, bringing out the savage-looking dirk, throwing it open with a deft movement of his wrist, and shaving off a huge chew of tobacco. \"We have a hundred thousand drilled and armed men here in the State of Injianny, jest waitin\u0027 the word, to throw off the shackles of tyranny and destroy the tyrants.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There\u0027s another hundred thousand in Illinois and like numbers in other States. And they\u0027ll fight, too. They\u0027ll fight to the death, and every one of them is good for\u0027 at least three of the usurper Lincoln\u0027s minions. I\u0027d like nothing better than to get a good opportunity at three or four o\u0027 \u0027em, armed with nothin\u0027 more\u0027n this knife. I\u0027d like nothin\u0027 better than the chance to sock it into their black hearts. \u0027Twouldn\u0027t be the first time, nuther. The catfish around Jeffersonville could tell some stories if they could talk, about the Lincoln hounds I\u0027ve fed to \u0027em. I only want a good chance at \u0027em agin. I may go, but I\u0027ll take several of \u0027em with me. I\u0027ll die in my tracks afore I\u0027ll stand this any longer. I hate everything that wears blue worse\u0027n I do a mad-dog.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And I promise you,\" said Shorty solemnly, \"that you shall have all the chance you want sooner\u0027n you think for. I know a great deal more\u0027n I dare tell you now, but things is workin\u0027 to a head mighty fast, and you\u0027ll hear something drop before the next change o\u0027 the moon. You kin jest bet your shirt on that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The day was passing, and as the evening approached the train was running through a wilder, heavily-wooded country. Shorty\u0027s companions took their seats on the opposite side of the car and peered anxiously out of the window to recognize features of the darkening landscape. They were evidently getting near their destination.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Shorty overheard the \"Captain\" say to his partner:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The train\u0027ll stop for water in the middle of a big beech woods. We\u0027ll get off there and take a path that leads right to the lodge.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How far\u0027ll we have to tote these heavy carpetbags?\" grumbled the other.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Shorty slipped his hand into his pocket, grasped his revolvers and eased them around so that he could be certain to draw them when he wanted to. He was determined that those men should not leave the train before the stopping place arranged for his fellow-soldiers. He felt confident of being able to handle the two, but did not know how many confederates might be in waiting for them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll go it if there\u0027s a million of \u0027em,\" said he to himself. \"I\u0027ll save these two fellers anyway, if there\u0027s any good in 45-caliber bullets in their carcasses. I\u0027m jest achin\u0027 to put a half-ounce o\u0027 lead jest where that old scoundrel hatches his devilment.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The engine whistled long and shrilly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s the pumpin\u0027-station,\" said the \"Captain,\" rising and laying hold of the handles of the carpetbag.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"drop that. You can\u0027t leave this car till I give the word,\" said Shorty, rising as the train stopped, and putting himself in the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Can\u0027t, eh?\" said the \"Captain,\" with a look of rage as he comprehended the situation. His dirk came out and opened with a wicked snap. \"I\u0027ll cut your black heart out, you infernal spy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0027how Do You Like the Looks of That, Old Butternut 169\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You will, eh?\" sneered Shorty, covering him with a heavy Remington. \"How\u0027d you like the looks o\u0027 that, old butternut? Your murderin\u0027 dirk aint deuce high. Move a step, and you\u0027ll know how it feels to have daylight through you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The \"Captain\" smashed the window with a backward blow of his fist, thrust his head out and yelled the rallying-cry of the Knights:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Asa! Asa!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The sound of rushing feet was heard, and a man armed with a shot-gun came into the plane of light from the open caboose door. Shorty was on the lookout for him, and as he appeared, shouted;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Halt, there! drop that gun. If you move I\u0027ll kill this whelp here and then you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Do as he says, Stallins,\" groaned the frightened \"Captain.\" \"He\u0027s got the drop on me. drop your gun, but holler to the boys in the front car to come out.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To Shorty\u0027s amazement a score of men came rushing back from the car next ahead of the caboose. They had, by a preconcerted arrangement, been jumping on the train ever since it grew dark, and collected in that car. Some of them had guns, but the most appeared unarmed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, I have stirred up a yaller-jacket\u0027s nest for sure,\" thought Shorty, rather tickled at the odds which were arrayed against him. \"But I believe I kin handle \u0027em until either the train pulls out or the boys hear the ruction and come to my help.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then he called out sternly as he raised the revolver in his left hand:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll shoot the first man that attempts to come on this car, and I\u0027ll kill your Captain, that I\u0027ve got covered, dead. You man with that shot-gun, p\u0027int it straight up in the air or I\u0027ll drop you in your tracks. Now fire off both barrels.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It seemed to every man in the gang that Shorty\u0027s left-hand revolver was pointing straight at him. The man with the shot-gun was more than certain of this, and he at once complied with the order.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was a whistle, followed by a rush of men from a line further out, and every man of those around Shorty was either knocked down or rudely punched with a musket-barrel in the hands of Lieut. Bigelow\u0027s squad.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What in the world made you so long comin\u0027?\" asked Shorty, after all the prisoners had been secured. \"Was you asleep?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No,\" answered the Lieutenant. \"This is the place where we intended to get off. We were quietly getting out so as to attract no notice when you started your circus. I saw you were doing well, hiving those fellows together, so I let you go ahead, while I slipped the boys around to gather them all in. Pretty neat job for a starter, wasn\u0027t it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63286.html","bookId":439,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 8:15:27 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 8:15:27 AM"}
