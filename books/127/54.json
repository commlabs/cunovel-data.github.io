It\u0026nbsp; amounts to a\u0026nbsp; distortion of the anarchic\u0026nbsp; period a centuryago, when the imperial troops were driven out and an independent governmentwas\u0026nbsp; set\u0026nbsp; up.\u0026nbsp; Advanced\u0026nbsp; science and\u0026nbsp; nuclear\u0026nbsp; power\u0026nbsp; in particular\u0026nbsp; becameidentified\u0026nbsp; with\u0026nbsp; the\u0026nbsp; old\u0026nbsp; imperial\u0026nbsp; regime they\u0026nbsp; remember\u0026nbsp; with\u0026nbsp; horror.\"\"That so?

Put that baldly, itsounds silly, but it is sound, psychologically. To make strategic sales, atstrategic\u0026nbsp; points, would\u0026nbsp; be to\u0026nbsp; create a\u0026nbsp; pro-nucleics faction\u0026nbsp; at court.\"\"And they send you\u0026nbsp; for that purpose, while I\u0027m only here to ransom you andleave,\u0026nbsp; while\u0026nbsp; you\u0026nbsp; keep\u0026nbsp; on trying?\u0026nbsp; Isn\u0027t\u0026nbsp; that\u0026nbsp; sort of\u0026nbsp; tail-backward?\"\"In what way?\" said Gorov, guardedly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Listen,\"\u0026nbsp; Ponyets\u0026nbsp; was suddenly\u0026nbsp; exasperated,\u0026nbsp; \"you\u0027re a\u0026nbsp; diplomat, not\u0026nbsp; atrader, and\u0026nbsp; calling you a trader won\u0027t make you one.\u0026nbsp; This case is for onewho\u0027s made a business\u0026nbsp; of selling ?and I\u0027m here with a full cargo stinkinginto\u0026nbsp; uselessness, and\u0026nbsp; a quota\u0026nbsp; that won\u0027t\u0026nbsp; ever be\u0026nbsp; met, it\u0026nbsp; looks like.\"\"You\u0026nbsp; mean you\u0027re\u0026nbsp; going to\u0026nbsp; risk your\u0026nbsp; life on\u0026nbsp; something that\u0026nbsp; isn\u0027t yourbusiness?\" Gorov smiled thinly.\n\u003cbr\u003e Ponyets said,\u0026nbsp; \"You mean\u0026nbsp; that this is\u0026nbsp; a matter of\u0026nbsp; patriotism and tradersaren\u0027t patriotic?\"\"Notoriously not.
