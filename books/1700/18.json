You deceived innocent children into risking their lives for your purposes. Your refusal to follow the orders of myself and Tori Wu, the former leader of Dauntless, resulted in countless deaths in the Erudite attack. You betrayed your peers by failing to do as we agreed and by failing to fight against Jeanine Matthews. You betrayed your own faction by revealing what was supposed to be a guarded secret.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I did not—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am not finished,” Evelyn says. “Given your record of service to this city, we have decided on an alternate solution. You will not, unlike the other former faction representatives, be forgiven and allowed to consult on issues regarding this city. Nor will you be executed as a traitor. Instead, you will be sent outside the fence, beyond the Amity compound, and you will not be allowed to return.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus looks surprised. I don’t blame him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Congratulations,” says Evelyn. “You have the privilege of beginning again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould I feel relieved, that my father isn’t going to be executed? Angry, that I came so close to finally escaping him, but instead he’ll still be in this world, still hanging over my head?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know. I don’t feel anything. My hands go numb, so I know I’m panicking, but I don’t really feel it, not the way I normally do. I am overwhelmed with the need to be somewhere else, so I turn and leave my parents and Nita and the city where I once lived behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-ONE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTRIS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHEY ANNOUNCE THE attack drill in the morning, over the intercom, as we eat breakfast. The crisp, female voice instructs us to lock the door to whatever room we are in from the inside, cover the windows, and sit quietly until the alarms no longer sound. “It will take place at the top of the hour,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTobias looks worn and pale, with dark circles under his eyes. He picks at a muffin, pinching small pieces off and sometimes eating them, sometimes forgetting to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of us woke up late, at ten, I suspect because there was no reason not to. When we left the city, we lost our factions, our sense of purpose. Here there is nothing to do but wait for something to happen, and far from making me feel relaxed, it makes me feel jittery and tense. I am used to having something to do, something to fight, all the time. I try to remind myself to relax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They took us up in a plane yesterday,” I say to Tobias. “Where were you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just had to walk around. Process things.” He sounds terse, irritated. “How was it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amazing, actually.” I sit across from him so that our knees touch in the space between our beds. “The world is . . . a lot bigger than I thought it was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods. “I probably wouldn’t have enjoyed it. Heights, and all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know why, but his reaction disappoints me. I want him to say that he wishes he had been there with me, to experience it with me. Or at least to ask me what I mean when I say that it was amazing. But all he can say is that he wouldn’t have liked it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you all right?” I say. “You look like you barely slept.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, yesterday carried quite the revelation,” he says, putting his forehead into his hand. “You can’t really blame me for being upset about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mean, you can be upset about whatever you want,” I say, frowning. “But from my perspective, it doesn’t seem like there’s much to be upset about. I know it’s a shock, but as I said, you’re still the same person you were yesterday and the day before, no matter what these people say about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head. “I’m not talking about my genes. I’m talking about Marcus. You really have no idea, do you?” The question is accusatory, but his tone isn’t. He gets up to toss his muffin in the trash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel raw and frustrated. Of course I knew about Marcus. It was buzzing around the room when I woke up. But for some reason I didn’t think it would upset him to know his father wasn’t going to be executed. Apparently I was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt doesn’t help that the alarms sound at that exact moment, preventing me from saying anything else to him. They are loud, screeching, so painful to listen to that I can barely think, let alone move. I keep one hand clamped over my ear and slide my other hand under my pillow to pick up the screen with my mother’s journal on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTobias locks the door and draws the curtains closed, and everyone sits on their cots. Cara wraps a pillow around her head. Peter just sits with his back against the wall, his eyes closed. I don’t know where Caleb is—researching whatever made him so distant yesterday, probably—or where Christina and Uriah are—exploring the compound, maybe. Yesterday after dessert they seemed determined to discover every corner of the place. I decided to discover my mother’s thoughts about it instead—she wrote several entries about her first impressions of the compound, the strange cleanliness of the place, how everyone smiled all the time, how she fell in love with the city by watching it in the control room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn on the screen, hoping to distract myself from the noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday I volunteered to go inside the city. David said the Divergent are dying and someone has to stop it, because that’s a waste of our best genetic material. I think that’s a pretty sick way to put it, but David doesn’t mean it that way—he just means that if it wasn’t the Divergent dying, we wouldn’t intervene until a certain level of destruction, but since it’s them it has to be taken care of now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust a few years, he said. All I have here are a few friends, no family, and I’m young enough that it will be easy to insert me—just wipe and resupply a few people’s memories, and I’m in. They’ll put me in Dauntless, at first, because I already have tattoos, and that would be hard to explain to the people inside the experiment. The only problem is that at my Choosing Ceremony next year I’ll have to join Erudite, because that’s where the killer is, and I’m not sure I’m smart enough to make it through initiation. David says it doesn’t matter, he can alter my results, but that feels wrong. Even if the Bureau thinks the factions don’t mean anything, that they’re just a kind of behavioral modification that will help with the damage, those people believe they do, and it feels wrong to play with their system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve been watching them for a couple years now, so there’s not much I need to know about fitting in. I bet I know the city better than they do, at this point. It’s going to be difficult to send my updates—someone might notice that I’m connecting to a distant server instead of an intra-city server, so my entries will probably come less often, if at all. It will be hard to separate myself from everything I know, but maybe it will be good. Maybe it will be a fresh start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could really use one of those.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a lot to take in, but I find myself rereading the sentence: The only problem is that at my Choosing Ceremony next year I’ll have to join Erudite, because that’s where the killer is. I don’t know what killer she’s referring to—Jeanine Matthews’s predecessor, maybe?—but more confusing even than that is that she didn’t join Erudite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat happened to make her join Abnegation instead?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe alarms stop, and my ears feel muffled in their absence. The others trickle out slowly, but Tobias lingers for a moment, tapping his fingers against his leg. I don’t speak to him—I’m not sure I want to hear what he has to say right now, when we’re both on edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut all he says is, “Can I kiss you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” I say, relieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bends down and touches my cheek, then kisses me softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, he knows how to improve my mood, at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I didn’t think about Marcus. I should have,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugs. “It’s over now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know it’s not over. It’s never over with Marcus; the wrongs he committed are too great. But I don’t press the issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More journal entries?” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” I say. “Just some memories of the compound so far. But it’s getting interesting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good,” he says. “I’ll leave you with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles a little, but I can tell he’s still tired, still upset. I don’t try to stop him from going. In a way, it feels like we are leaving each other to our grief, his over the loss of his Divergence and whatever hopes he had for Marcus’s trial, and mine, finally, over the loss of my parents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tap the screen to read the next entry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear David,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI raise my eyebrows. Now she’s writing to David?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear David,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m sorry, but it’s not going to happen the way we planned it. I can’t do it. I know you’re just going to think I’m being a stupid teenager, but this is my life and if I’m going to be here for years, I have to do this my way. I’ll still be able to do my job from outside of Erudite. So tomorrow, at the Choosing Ceremony, Andrew and I are going to choose Abnegation together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope you’re not angry. I guess even if you are, I won’t hear about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—Natalie\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI read the entry again, and again, letting the words sink in. Andrew and I are going to choose Abnegation together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile into my hand, lean my head against the window, and let the tears fall in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy parents did love each other. Enough to forsake plans and factions. Enough to defy “faction before blood.” Blood before faction—no, love before faction, always.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn off the screen. I don’t want to read anything that will spoil this feeling: that I am adrift in calm waters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s strange how, even though I should be grieving, I feel like I am actually getting back pieces of her, word by word, line by line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-TWO\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTRIS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHERE ARE ONLY a dozen more entries in the file, and they don’t tell me everything I want to know, though they do give me more questions. And instead of just containing her thoughts and impressions, they are all written to someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear David,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought you were more my friend than my supervisor, but I guess I was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat did you think would happen when I came in here, that I would live single and alone forever? That I wouldn’t get attached to anyone? That I wouldn’t make any of my own choices?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left everything behind to come in here when no one else wanted to. You should be thanking me instead of accusing me of losing sight of my mission. Let’s get this straight: I’m not going to forget why I’m here just because I chose Abnegation and I’m going to get married. I deserve to have a life of my own. One that I choose, not one that you and the Bureau choose for me. You should know all about that—you should understand why this life would appeal to me after all I’ve seen and been through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonestly, I don’t really think you care that I didn’t choose Erudite like I was supposed to. It sounds like you’re actually just jealous. And if you want me to keep updating you, you’ll apologize for doubting me. But if you don’t, I won’t send you any more updates, and I certainly won’t leave the city to visit anymore. It’s up to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—Natalie\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder if she was right about David. The thought itches at my mind. Was he really jealous of my father? Did his jealousy fade over time? I can only see their relationship from her eyes, and I’m not sure she’s the most accurate source of information about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can tell she’s getting older in the entries, her language becoming more refined as time separates her from the fringe where she once lived, her reactions becoming more moderate. She’s growing up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI check the date on the next entry. It’s a few months later, but it’s not addressed to David the way some of the others have been. The tone is different too—not as familiar, more straightforward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tap the screen, flipping through the entries. It takes me ten taps to reach an entry that is addressed to David again. The date on the entry suggests that it came a full two years later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear David,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got your letter. I understand why you can’t be on the receiving end of these updates anymore, and I’ll respect your decision, but I’ll miss you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish you every happiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—Natalie\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI try to flip forward, but the journal entries are over. The last document in the file is a certificate of death. The cause of death says multiple gunshot wounds to the torso. I rock back and forth a little, to dispel the image of her collapsing in the street from my mind. I don’t want to think about her death. I want to know more about her and my father, and her and David. Anything to distract me from the way her life ended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a sign of how desperate I am for information—and action—that I go to the control room with Zoe later that morning. She talks to the manager of the control room about a meeting with David as I stare, determined, at my feet, not wanting to see what’s on the screens. I feel like if I allow myself to look at them, even for a moment, I will become addicted to them, lost in the old world because I don’t know how to navigate this new one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Zoe finishes her conversation, though, I can’t keep my curiosity in check. I look at the large screen hanging over the desks. Evelyn is sitting on her bed, running her hands over something on her bedside table. I move closer to see what it is, and the woman at the desk in front of me says, “This is the Evelyn cam. We track her 24-7.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can you hear her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Only if we turn the volume up,” the woman replies. “We mostly keep the sound off, though. Hard to listen to that much chatter all day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. “What is that she’s touching?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some kind of sculpture, I don’t know.” The woman shrugs. “She stares at it a lot, though.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/allegiant-divergent-3/page-18.html","bookId":1700,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:52 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:58:52 AM"}
