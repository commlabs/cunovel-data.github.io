It was then he spied Chu Cheng sauntering over towards him with a lazy, unhurried gait. In his fine suit and vest, he was having no trouble attracting looks from the young girls around campus. From time to time he’d shoot a charming smile at them as they passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eLan Jue turned his back and made to leave, like he had no interest in dealing with the guy.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eOf course Chu Cheng wouldn’t be denied, and his reaction time was nearly inhuman. Immediately his voice rose in a shout. “A-Jue, wait a minute!”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eZhou Qianlin and Tang Mi both turned to the source of the greeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eChu Cheng made his approach with big steps. By the time he arrived, he was already puffed up and beaming with pride. “What didja thing? Nice, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e“Him or you,” Lan Jue asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e“Me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e\"You said two words,” Lan Jue muttered. “What\u0027s good about it? Tell you what though, I had no idea how talented \u003ci\u003ehe\u003c/i\u003e was.”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eA ghost of agitation flashed across Chu Cheng’s pained face. “Are you even capable of being a pleasant human being?”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e“You\u0027re free to keep your distance,” Lan Jue replied. “And when you’re all steeped in your machismo bullshit don’t tell people you know me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eBut Chu Cheng had already tuned Lan Jue out, the moment his eyes found the two young women standing nearby. His eyes lasciviously traced paths up and down their bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e“Eh? Little sister, you’re here as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eThe second the words left his mouth, Lan Jue winced. The damage was done, there was nothing he could do.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e“Little sister?” Tang Mi looked at Qianlin and Chu Cheng, back and forth. “Qianlin, what’s going on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eZhou Qianlin’s own appraisal and reaction skills were impressive. “I don’t know you,”she said instantly. “Xiao Mi, let’s get out of here. This one reminds me of Richard.” She grabbed her friend’s hand and pulled her away.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eLan Jue watched the exchange in conflicted praise. She was quite the sneak, but he wasn’t sure this was a good thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eChu Cheng watched her leave. “She really does look just like her,” he muttered, mostly to himself. “Cut from the same mold. I’m telling you A-Jue, you better know what you’re doing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e“Will you shut the hell up, or am I going to have to make you a mute,” Lan Jue said in hushed tones. “Let’s go. I’ve got no classes, so let’s head back and get to practicing. I guess we’ll find out later when A-Li will show up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eChu Cheng laughed suspiciously. “Such a troublesome business, these concerts eh? If we wait around for a bit we’ll run in to him, I’m sure.”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eLan Jue raised a brow. “He spoke to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eChu Cheng rolled his eyes. “You need to ask? You really have been hidden away from the modern world for much too long. Let’s go!”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eThe Soulcaller gemstone warmed as his will flowed through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eLan Jue: \u003ci\u003eWhen are you going home? There shouldn’t be any classes this afternoon if I recall.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eQianlin: \u003ci\u003eOriginal I’d planned to head out after the concert. But I just ran in to the R\u0026amp;D Director who says I’m expected to participate in the competition again Lir University. The R\u0026amp;D section, obviously. He said he wanted to have a word with me. I’ll probably be heading home later.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eLan Jue: \u003ci\u003eLet me know when you’re finished and I’ll go find you.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eQianlin: \u003ci\u003eAlright.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eThe two young men left the campus. As they did, it was like Chu Cheng predicted; a furtive figure sneak up up to them trying desperately to remain inconspicuous. Hat, mask, glasses, and a school uniform. A-Li.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eLan Jue pushed his bicycle over to the bundle of mis-matched clothing. “Absolutely wretched. If only your fans could see you now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e“Hush!” What little bit of Hua Li’s face could be seen was scrunched in admonishment. “Keep it down. You’ll know wretched if anyone finds me here.” He practically growled the words, trying to look every direction at once.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eLan Jue only chuckled. “Your concert today was really something, truth be told. It was just my first time seeing one but I gotta say, you don’t hold back with the Discipline do you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eHua Li chortled. “Indeed. Got a pretty moving voice if I do say so myself. First Star of the Alliances, I think it’s fair to say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eLan Jue smirked. “That’s enough. Let’s head back to mine, it’s time we finally got back to training our mecha combat coop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e“Yup, let’s do it. Only you just have the one bicycle, what’s the plan?” Hua Li asked inquisitively.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eLan Jue paused. “This is a problem,” he said, glowering at the bike. “So who’s running?”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eHua Li’s indignation flared. “You\u0027d make the First Star of the Alliances \u003ci\u003erun home\u003c/i\u003e?! Do you have \u003ci\u003eany\u003c/i\u003e humanity?”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eChu Cheng’s response was equally as wrathful. “You’d make the First Heart-throb of the Alliances run home? Do you have any humanity?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eLan Jue looked from one to other for a minute before answering.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e“Do either of you have any shame?”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eFive minutes later.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eA bicycle wobbled precariously down the street in the direction of Skyfire Avenue. Lan Jue was peddling valiantly, Chu Cheng sat on the back, and Hua Li was perched on the cross girder just behind the handlebars.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eThe bike had long since started protesting with a series of painful squeals.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eLan Jue rode the bike a sight less gracefully than he’d have liked. The three of them with their long legs - none of them were shorter than a meter eighty-five - where too large even for this bike. In it’s time the antique was among the larger sized bicycles, but despite this it was a struggle to fit the three of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e“\u003ci\u003eNo shame!\u003c/i\u003e” Lan Jue breathlessly rebuked his friends as he strenuously peddled forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eHua Li spat back at him. “It’s not your ass being split by this damn bar, what are you complaining about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eChu Cheng’s rumbling voice interjected. “Quite the experience though. If elder brother was here he’d probably have to stand on the handle bars.”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eLan Jue’s voice was cold and biting. “My brother has more self-respect than the two of you. If he were here the two of you\u0027d both be desperate to hide from a beating.”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eHua Li snickered. “Well he ain’t here is he. Hm? What’s this person doing blocking the road.”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eLan Jue craned his head around the clothing mannequin perched in front of him. It was as his friend said; four people were blocking the small road, leaving no way around.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eLan Jue rolled to a stop and steadied himself on one leg. “The two of you get off!”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eChu Cheng only needed to let his legs relax and drop to the floor to be free of the bike. Hua Li had to wait for Lan Jue to release the handled before he could get down.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e“Hey, you guys are blocking the road!” Chu cheng called out to the four figures before them.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e“We\u0027re looking for Lan Jue. If you aren’t him, you’re free to pass.” A cold and threatening voice replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eThe young men where clad entirely in black, and bore a sinister air. They stared with open hostility at Lan Jue.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eHua Li and Chu Cheng looked at their friend in tandem, but it was Hua Li who spoke first. “The hell is this? Looking for trouble?”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eChu Cheng was next. “These guys don’t know who you are, huh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eLan Jue regarded them both. “Time to earn your bike ride.”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eChu Cheng was literally hopping with excitement. \"Oh! Oh let me! Me!” He was off at a trot towards the four young men before getting an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eOne minute later.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eThe bicycle groaned pathetically as it struggled along the path.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e“So who’d you piss off, A-Jue? Got these noobs hassling ya. Not a one higher than sixth rank. I didn’t even get myself going. What a let down.” Chu Cheng grumbled dejectedly from the back.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eHua Li huffed. “You didn’t leave any for me, either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eOf course Lan Jue knew where those four hoodlums had come from. He could see the moment they used their Disciplines that they had Acquired talents. Clearly they were from the Western Alliance. Hua Li and Chu Cheng knew this as well, but that didn’t answer their question.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eIf they were from the Western Alliance then their master was obvious. Richard finally grew the balls to go for him? Lan Jue figured it was time the young guy was dealt with. He was becoming a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e“Hey A-Li, let’s get a song,” Lan Jue said, changing the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eHua Li was easily swayed. “Any requests?”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e“One of the ones from the concert,” he said. “Let\u0027s hear \u0027em again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e“…”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eWhile Lan Jue and his two companions were slowly making their way home, the NEU was still awash in the afterglow of the concert. The excitement was still evident in the passing students and teachers wandering around campus. After all, this was probably a once in a lifetime event.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e“What? Run away?” Mo Xiao had to employ all her will power not to smash the tea table in front of her in to pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eOutside, members of the media had already filled up the sizable reception room for Poseidon’s scheduled address. Hua Li had said he was going to change his clothes - and then, he’d just vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e“This \u003ci\u003ebastard!\u003c/i\u003e \u003ci\u003eI’ll KILL HIM!” \u003c/i\u003eMo Xiao shot to her her feet in a rage, fists clenched and knuckles white. She paced back and forth in the dressing room. “Could he be any more unreliable?”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eThe assistant at her elbow spoke up in quiet tones. “Well he is a Pisces.”[1. Hey, me too! First Translator of the Alliances right here!]\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e“\u003ci\u003eI know!\u003c/i\u003e” She roared. “Alright… help me with some make-up. I’ll deal with the journalists. Such a goddamn waste of time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eTen minutes later.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eMo Xiao stepped out to the junket, and appologized to the media that Poseidon would be unable to participate. Tearfully she explained that the whole experience had been an emotional one. Poseidon was still composing himself, and so was currently unable to hold a fair interview.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eThe craze that had grabbed a hold of the students had also infected the journalists, and the vast majority understood and sympathized with Hua Li’s fictional plight. The vocal minority who were still upset with his absence were cajoled by Mo Xiao’s persistent apologies. She assured them that Poseidon would give interviews as soon as he was able. She followed by formally announcing the release of Poseidon’s \u003ci\u003eSounds of Nature\u003c/i\u003e special throughout the whole of the three Alliances.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp style\u003d\"text-align: center\"\u003eΞ\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eBy the time Lan Jue returned to the NEU campus, the land was covered in the encroaching darkness of night.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eZhou Qianlin was standing on her own, tiredly pinching the skin between her eyebrows. All afternoon had been talks and considerations, to the point where she was too tired to go on.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e“By the looks of you, you haven’t eaten yet.” Lan Jue was standing beside his bicycle, calling towards her.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eQianlin lifted her eyes to look at him, and she couldn’t help a small smile from flashing across her face. She shook her head. “It\u0027s fine, I’m not hungry. Just a little tired.”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eLan Jue produced a lunchbox from the bike and handed it to her. “Here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003eQianlin took it with surprise. She opened it to see, and discovered a handful of dumplings steaming within.\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e“Chives and egg,” he said with a grin. He handed her a pair of chopsticks. “We\u0027ll go when you’ve finished, otherwise you’ll get sick if we eat and move.” [2. The Chinese believe that doing anything while eating is bad. Here specifically, it is said that if you eat and move you’ll \u0027eat wind’ - wind is the basis for pain and exogenous illnesses in Chinese medicine.]\u003c/p\u003e\n   \u003cp\u003e“Mm.” Qianlin hummed her agreement.
