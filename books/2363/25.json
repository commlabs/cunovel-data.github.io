He had honeymooned there with Susan, and the memories were overpowering. Rome was Roberto, who managed the Hassler Hotel for his mother, and who was partially deaf but could lip-read in five languages. Rome was the gardens of Villa d\u0027Este in Tivoli, and the Ristorante Sibilla and Susan\u0027s delight at the one hundred fountains created by the son of Lucrezia Borgia. Rome was Otello at the bottom of the Spanish Steps, and the Vatican, and the Colosseum and the Forum and Michelangelo\u0027s Moses. Rome was sharing tartufi at Tre Scalini and the sound of Susan\u0027s laughter, and her voice saying, \"Please promise me we\u0027ll always be this happy, Robert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell am I doing here? Robert wondered. I don\u0027t have any idea who the priest is, or whether he\u0027s even in Rome. It\u0027s time to retire, to go home and forget all this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut something inside him, some stubborn streak inherited from a long-dead ancestor, would not let him. I\u0027ll give it one day, Robert decided. Just one more day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Leonardo da Vinci airport was crowded, and it seemed to Robert that every other person was a priest. He was looking for one priest in a city of - what? Fifty thousand priests? A hundred thousand? In the taxi on the way to the Hassler Hotel, he noticed crowds of robed priests on the streets. This is impossible, Robert thought. I must be out of my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was greeted in the lobby of the Hassler Hotel by the assistant manager.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Commander Bellamy! What a pleasure to see you again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Pietro. Do you have a room for me for one night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For you - of course. Always!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert was escorted to a room he had occupied before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If there\u0027s anything you need, Commander, please ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI need a bloody miracle, Robert thought. He sat down on the bed and lay back, trying to clear his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would a priest from Rome travel to Switzerland? There were several possibilities. He might have gone on vacation, or there might have been a convocation of priests. He was the only priest on the tour bus. What did that signify? Nothing. Except, perhaps, that he was not travelling with a group. So it could have been a trip to visit his friends or family. Or maybe he was with a group, and they had other plans that day. Robert\u0027s thoughts were going around in a futile circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack to the beginning. How did the priest get to Switzerland? The chances are pretty good that he doesn\u0027t own a car. Someone could have given him a lift, but more probably he travelled by plane or train or took a bus. If he were on vacation, he wouldn\u0027t have a lot of time. So let\u0027s assume he took a plane. That line of reasoning led nowhere. Airlines did not list the occupations of their passengers. The priest would be yet another name on the passenger manifest. But if he were part of a group ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Vatican, the official residence of the Pope, rises majestically on Vatican Hill, on the west bank of the Tiber, in the northwest end of Rome. The dome of St Peter\u0027s Basilica, designed by Michelangelo, towers over the huge piazza, filled day and night with avid sightseers of all faiths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe piazza is surrounded by two semicircular colonnades completed in 1667 by Bernini, with 284 columns of travertine marble placed in four rows and surmounted by a balustrade on which stand 140 statues. Robert had visited there a dozen times, but each time the sight took his breath away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe interior of the Vatican, of course, was even more spectacular. The Sistine Chapel and the museum and the Sala Rotonda were indescribably beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut on this day, Robert had not come here to sightsee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found the Office of Public Relations for the Vatican in the wing of the building devoted to secular affairs. The young man behind the desk was polite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert flashed an identification card. \"I\u0027m with Time magazine. I\u0027m doing an article on some priests who attended a convocation in Switzerland in the past week or two. I\u0027m looking for background information.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man studied him for a moment, then frowned. \"We had some priests attend a convocation in Venice last month. None of our priests was in Switzerland recently. I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s really very important,\" Robert said earnestly. \"How would I go about getting that information?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The group you are looking for ... what branch of the Church do they represent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg your pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are many Roman Catholic Orders. There are Franciscans, Marists, Benedictines, Trappists, Jesuits, Dominicans, and several others. I suggest you go to the Order they belong to and inquire there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere the hell is \"there\"? Robert wondered. \"Do you have any other suggestions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither have I, Robert thought. I found the haystack. I can\u0027t find the needle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left the Vatican and wandered through the streets of Rome, heedless of the people around him, concentrating on his problem. At the Piazza del Popolo, he sat down at an outdoor cafe and ordered a Cinzano. It sat in front of him, untouched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor all he knew, the priest could still be in Switzerland. What Order does he belong to? I don\u0027t know. And I have only the professor\u0027s word that he was Roman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a sip of his drink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a late afternoon plane to Washington. I\u0027m going to be on it, Robert decided. I give up. The thought galled him. Out, not with a bang, but with a whimper. It was time to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Il conto, per favore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Si, signore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert\u0027s eyes swept idly around the piazza. Across from the cafe, a bus was loading passengers. In the line were two priests. Robert watched as the passengers paid their fares and moved toward the back of the bus. When the priests reached the conductor, they smiled at him and took their seats without paying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your check, signore,\" the waiter said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert didn\u0027t even hear him. His mind was racing. Here, in the heart of the Catholic Church, priests had certain privileges. It was possible, just possible ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe offices of Swissair are located at 10 Via Po, five minutes from the Via Veneto. Robert was greeted by a man behind the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I see the manager, please?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am the manager. Can I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert flashed an identification card. \"Michael Hudson. Interpol.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I do for you, Mr Hudson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some international carriers are complaining about illegal price discounting in Europe - in Rome, particularly. According to international convention ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me, Mr Hudson, but Swissair does not give discounts. Everyone pays the posted fares.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With the exception of employees of the airline, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you have a discount for priests?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. On this airline, they pay full fare.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn this airline. \"Thank you for your time.\" And Robert was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis next stop - and his last hope - was Alitalia. \"Illegal discounts?\" The manager was staring at Robert, puzzled. \"We give discounts only to our employees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you give discounts to priests?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe manager\u0027s face brightened. \"Ah, that, yes. But that is not illegal. We have arrangements with the Catholic Church.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert\u0027s heart soared. \"So, if a priest wanted to fly from Rome, say - to Switzerland, he would use this airline?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it would be cheaper for him. Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert said, \"In order to bring our computers up-to-date, it would be helpful if you could tell me how many priests have flown to Switzerland in the past two weeks. You would have a record of that, wouldn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, of course. For tax purposes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would really appreciate that information.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wish to know how many priests have flown to Switzerland in the past two weeks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Zurich or Geneva.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a moment. I will talk to our computers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive minutes later, the manager returned with a computer printout. \"There was only one priest who flew Alitalia to Switzerland in the past two weeks.\" He consulted the printout. \"He left Rome on the seventh, and flew to Zurich. His return flight was booked for two days ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert took a deep breath. \"His name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Father Romero Patrini.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His address?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down at the paper again. \"He lives in Orvieto. If you need any further ...\" He looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert was gone. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-doomsday-conspiracy/page-25.html","bookId":2363,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:21 AM"}
