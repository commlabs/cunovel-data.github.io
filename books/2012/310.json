But he lied to me, and I don’t like being lied to.’ He pointed a finger at Kindly. ‘We’re not done, you and me. I’ll be waiting for you at Hood’s Gate, old man.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Pathetic,’ hissed Faradan Sort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey left Blistig where he was, and the way he held himself, it would be a while before he’d be ready to start walking again. Skanarow moved alongside Ruthan Gudd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I was hoping we’d just kill him,’ she said, low under her breath. ‘The man’s a murderer, after all. Pores wasn’t even wearing a weapon belt, and his knife was jammed hilt deep in a bale on the wagon.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If anyone will be looking for Blistig at Hood’s Gate, it will be Lieutenant Pores, don’t you think?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Skanarow shook her head. ‘I never believed in retribution beyond Death’s Gates. Nobody is squatting on the other side weighing and balancing a life’s scales.’ She stumbled slightly and Ruthan moved to catch her. Felt her momentarily sag against him. ‘Shit, I may not last the night.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You will, Skanarow. I’m not letting you die, do you understand me?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘There’s no way out, and you know it, my love. You know it – you can’t hide what I see in your eyes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said nothing, because there was nothing to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You’ll forget me, won’t you? Eventually. Like … all the rest.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Don’t say that, Skanarow – it’s the wrong thing to think. For people … like me … it’s not forgetting that is our curse. It’s remembering.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile was faint, and she disengaged herself from his half-embrace. ‘Then I beg you, love, do all that you can to forget me. Leave no memory behind to haunt you – let it all fade. It shouldn’t be hard – what we had didn’t last long, did it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d heard such words before. And this is why remembering is a curse .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlistig faced back the way they’d come. Off in the distance he could make out the glow of lanterns, the lights swinging low to the ground. Frowning, he watched as they came closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe killed us. Come the dawn, when we’re all finished, unable to take another step, I’m going to go to her. I’m going to stick a knife in her. Not a fatal wound, not right away, no. In the stomach, where the acids will all leak out and start eating her up from the inside out. And I’ll kneel over her, staring down into her pain, and that will be the sweetest sight I will ever see. A sight to carry me right into death .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even that won’t be enough, not for what she’s done to us. Kindly, at Hood’s Gate, you’re going to have to wait, because I won’t be finished with Tavore Paran of House Paran .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eT’lan Imass, carrying a makeshift stretcher on which lay a swaddled body. Beside this, a marine with blood covering his hands and forearms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlistig squinted as they drew closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe T’lan Imass walked past him and the Fist looked down at the pale face of the man on the stretcher. He grunted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe marine halted before him, saluted. ‘Fist,’ he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Pores ain’t dead yet? What was the point of that, healer?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlistig’s answer was a fist smashing into his face, hard enough to crush his nose, send him reeling back. Stumbling, falling to the ground. Blood gushing down, he lay stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe healer moved to stand over him. ‘Thing is, Fist,’ he said, massaging his hand, ‘what with all the shit Pores has gone through because of you, we decided to make him an honorary marine. Now, you go sticking a knife in a fellow marine and, well, we’re out for you now. Understand me, sir? The marines are out for you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlistig listened to the man walk off in the wake of the T’lan Imass. He made it on to his side to spit out slime and blood, and then grunted a laugh. Aye, and a man is measured by his enemies .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo your worst, marines. So long as I get to her first .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was some time before he managed to regain his feet, but when he set off after the column, his strides were stiff, jerking, filled with a strength past anything he had known before. In his head three words made a mantra. To see her. To see her. To see her .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Khundryl camp was being packed up, but the people doing the task moved with aching slowness. The claws upon their skin seemed to be dragging them down, and Badalle watched in the midst of twenty or so of Rutt’s children, as everything that was coming along for this final night was put in its proper place – everything but for the mother’s tent, and she was yet to emerge. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-310.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
