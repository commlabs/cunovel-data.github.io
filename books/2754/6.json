{"id":84175,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\u003cp\u003eChapter 7\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaiah\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIN MY REARVIEW MIRROR, I watch as the angel restarts her car and floors it. Seconds ago, I had my doubts about whether I’d win, but my instincts were right on—she didn’t have the reaction needed to pull off a start at the flag. I won a whopping twenty dollars from the straight bet on this race, but I’m hoping for at least a grand once Eric gives me my take from his winnings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lips turn up as I pass the stop sign. My piece of crap beat an ’05 GT. That feat alone deserves a trip to the tattoo parlor. That is if I had money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ease off the gas and check the angel’s status. Damn, that car’s fast. I slow to a stop and wait for her to join me. The crowd gathered at the quarter mile calls out smack. A huge part of me wants her to cruise past and head straight home. Girls like her shouldn’t hear the words being tossed into the night. A small part of me wants her to stop so I can see her cute-pissed expression when she realizes that a street punk beat her and her expensive car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe angel finally catches up and I lose the smirk as I examine her. The streetlamp above us creates a glow around the mess of hair angling her face. She shouldn’t be here. In fact, there’s nothing right about this situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy throat moves as I swallow and, suddenly, my skin feels too tight on my body. Instinct? A sixth sense? I learned early in life to never discount the sensation. The noise of the onlookers becomes a shallow buzz as I glance at my side mirrors for the oncoming danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s when I see it—a faint strobe of light. I ignore all other sounds and strain to hear the one that can ruin my world: a distant wail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cops!” I yell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlue and red lights blaze in the distance. Chaos erupts as the bystanders scurry to their cars. Doors slam shut and anxious motors rumble to life. Feet pound against pavement as voices call for others to head into the dark alleys between the warehouses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shift my car into First and stomp on the gas. My tires squeal as I peel out. A curse leaves my mouth when I throw the car into Second. Eric has my money and collecting what I fully earned will be a lot more difficult without a crowd to verify the bets made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter how fucking hard I try, I always come out on the bottom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI check my mirrors to see the direction of the invasion. There’re three ways out of this labyrinth of warehouses and the cops know one, maybe two, but the third will be a hell of a drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA solitary white barrier in the middle of the street causes me to hit the brakes. “Fuck!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s still sitting there—the angel—like a damn sacrifice nailed to the ground. I yank on the steering wheel and one-eighty it back to where I started seconds before. What the hell is wrong with her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy driver’s side mirror barely misses hers as I stop next to her open window. “Get out of here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know where to go.” Red flushes brightly on her cheeks, in stark contrast to the pale white skin surrounding her eyes. Eyes that are wide and wild with fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy grip on the steering wheel tightens. Fuck. Just fuck. Losing the cops in one car is hard enough. Having a tail will only complicate things, but I can’t leave her. “Follow me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRachel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eISAIAH CIRCLES MY CAR AND speeds off the way he originally came. I chase after him and do my best to shift with arms and legs that no longer want to accept orders. The speedometer climbs in my race to not fall behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAir catches in my lungs and throat, causing me to choke. My brothers are going to murder me. Kill me. Crucify me. And never let this screwup go. My hand slips off the gearshift to press against the nausea eating at my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father will take away my car. My baby. He never would have bought it for me if he knew I had an addiction to speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd my mother...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do I explain any of this? Why I’m out past curfew? Why I’m on the south side? Why I’m drag racing? Even worse, how do I explain why I wanted to be drag racing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaiah turns sharply to the left. His brake lights never appear. I reach for the gearshift and switch pedals in order to make the turn. My back wheels slide out from under me and both hands struggle with the wheel as I fight to keep the car from spinning into a Dumpster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaustrophobia consumes me as the buildings gradually close in, making the road narrower and almost impossible to navigate. Garbage covers the roadway, and my stomach sinks as I realize there’s no way to avoid the debris. Isaiah runs over it and so must I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaiah’s lights flash off and I follow his lead. The glow of the full moon is the only pathetic light leading us. His Mustang pulls farther away from mine, and I shift into Fourth. We’re going too fast. Too fast on a too-narrow road. I shudder as the wheels roll over trash and a clink from under my car makes me cringe. Did something hit the gas tank? The transmission?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy heart pounds out of my chest when my car becomes airborne through an intersection. From the corner of my eye, I spot police cars running parallel to us on a street much wider than ours. Sirens scream into the night and as my car hammers back into the ground, I wait for that sound to shriek from right behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarkness envelops me again and I drop gear as Isaiah takes a last-second right. He’s too fast, which is impossible because my car is better than his. I shake my head as I understand the difference: he’s a better driver. It’s not hard to imagine. I’m not good at anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaiah’s car fishtails and I slam on my brakes to keep from crashing into his rear end. My breath leaves my body in a hiss. On either side of my car, metal warehouse walls threaten to scratch my side mirrors. He slows, and thanks to the dim security light hanging over a bay door, I see the reason for the reduced speed: shredded rubber spikes out from his front driver-side wheel. Isaiah destroyed the tire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrap. I’m going to jail and my mother is going to freak. She’ll cry and then she’ll know I’m nothing like the daughter she really loves—that I’m nothing like Colleen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaiah’s arm extends from his window, waving me on as he eases his car into a space between Dumpsters. I pull alongside of him and he hops out. “Two rights. One left. Then hit the freeway. Watch the cops. They’re running on the streets to the left and right of us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy throat tightens. To the left and the right? “Come with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaiah places his hands on the top of my car and leans over so that his head is level with mine. The strong scent of dark spices tickles my nose and I inhale deeply. A brief calm washes through me and somehow I know Isaiah will get me out of this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re pressing hard to find the racers, meaning us. If they pull you over—” his eyes trail over my hair then over my clothes “—they’ll probably let you go, but not if you’re with me. Especially if you’re with me. Go. Now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod and stare at the road in front of me. Two rights. One left. And if I get caught, they’ll probably let me go. I glance at Isaiah. He’s touching my car and I don’t even care. Which tells me I’m either beyond freaked or I like him. I flex my hands, which are sweating on the steering wheel. I pick the first option. I’m definitely freaking. “What will you do?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Walk.” His silver hoops glint in the moonlight as he performs a half shrug. “Go. I can take care of myself.” Isaiah steps away from the car, taking the dark scent of calm with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put the car into First, and a fresh wave of adrenaline floods my bloodstream when a cop car speeds across an intersection two warehouses ahead. Isaiah falls into the shadows with his back against the warehouse wall. His eyes travel back and forth down the alleyway. An hour ago, I never would have thought that someone like him would be my savior, but he is. What type of person would I be if I left my savior behind? “I’m not leaving without you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dammit.” He rubs a hand over his shaved head. “Just leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Promise you won’t get caught. Promise you’ll be okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe freezes midrub and shoots me a chilling look. “I won’t rat you out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRat me out? My forehead scrunches. To who? A siren wails, the sound much closer than I’d prefer. I blink rapidly as the answer dawns along with a sinking feeling. The police. Isaiah knows he’s going to be caught. “I’m...I’m not worried about that. I’m worried about you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe mumbles a word that begins with F and stalks toward me. “I’m driving.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDriving? No way. No one drives my car. “I don’t think...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaiah opens the door and stares me down with his hard gray eyes. “Passenger side. Now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePassenger side. Right now. On it. I slide over the console and grasp the side of the seat when Isaiah simultaneously shuts his door and guns the engine. I click my seat belt in place as he takes a sharp left. The speedometer continues to climb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I thought you said two rights.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis restless eyes check the rearview mirror. “The cop we saw took that route. I’m not interested in chasing him. Are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, but I doubt he sees it. He keeps his eyes trained on the ever-constricting slender space. It’s like we’re not even on a road anymore, but a sidewalk. My stomach cramps. Holy freaking crap. This is a walkway. The deep sound of the engine pushing out revolutions increases until Isaiah shifts into Fourth. Oh, hell, I’m gonna puke. We’re doing sixty. “Slow down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Slow down?” He smiles. I’m seconds away from a full-on panic attack and the guy actually smiles. “Your car can do over double what I’m asking it. In fact, it was built to be let loose. You should try it sometime.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do let it loose. Garbage can!” I close my eyes and bite back a scream when the car swerves to the left. Breathe, Rachel, breathe. Going mental is not going to help this situation. “I mean, slow down.” I reopen my eyes only to wish I hadn’t. Dumpster. Big Dumpster. Big freaking, going-to-wreck-my-car Dumpster. “You can’t make it. You can’t, you can’t, you can’t....”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he swings the car to the right and into an actual alleyway. “Don’t hurt her. Just don’t hurt her. Okay?” Tears prick my eyes and the breathing thing isn’t working and everything feels out of control. “She’s mine. This is mine. I don’t have much that’s mine. So you can’t destroy her, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s your name?” he asks in the calmest, deepest tone I’ve ever heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your name. I want your name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rachel,” I squeak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Rachel,” he says with a long drawl. I glance over at him when he says nothing else. His eyes flicker between me and the road. “I’m Isaiah, and I swear I’ll take care of you and your car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreathing becomes a little easier. “Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smell it again, his scent. The calming aroma. The one that’s become my new favorite. I take a deeper breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsaiah drops gears and for the first time hits the brake. “As soon as I stop, get out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t have time to ask what he means. Isaiah slams the car into Park, hops out and punches buttons on a security keypad. I do what he said and rub my arms as he eases my car into the garage, turns her off and relocks the garage door. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crash-into-you-pushing-the-limits-3/page-6.html","bookId":2754,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:57:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:57:53 PM"}
