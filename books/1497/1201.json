The old man Qing Hua, who had been observing from a short distance away, transformed into a blurry figure at this moment as he rushed to the essence flame with lightning-like speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan slightly knit his eyebrows when he saw old demon Qing Hua react so quickly. His eyes flickered, but he did not act immediately. Although the essence flame had appeared, there were still three Honorable Elders from the Hall of Souls looking on with ill intent. It would not be easy to snatch this flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chi!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld demon Qing Hua’s speed was extremely swift. Within a flash, he had appeared in front of the dark-black fire dragon. A hot expression flashed across his eyes. A vast, mighty Dou Qi surged out of his palms and grabbed the fire dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hmph, you are seeking death!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dou Qi of old demon Qing Hua had just been summoned when a couple of cold cries suddenly sounded before he could even make contact with the essence flame. Immediately, a wave of rattling metal sounds was transmitted over. A dark, cold wind stuck to the back of old demon Qing Hua.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld demon Qing Hua slightly frowned upon sensing this vicious force. His body flashed, and he hurriedly dodged. After which, his eyes were ice-cold as he looked at the black-clothed person who had intervened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hee hee, other people are not allowed to encroach upon the things my Hall of Souls want.” That black-clothed person coldly laughed. Over a dozen dark-black chains lingered around his body like poisonous snakes. Sharp spiritual screeches continued to be transmitted from the chains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will watch him. All of you should act and snatch the essence flame.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black-clothed person, who had attacked old demon Qing Hua, turned his head to the other two black-clothed Dou Zuns. He spoke in a deep voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Understood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose two black-clothed Dou Zuns also nodded upon hearing his words. After which, they rushed toward the essence flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe expression of old demon Qing Hua changed slightly upon seeing the action of these two people. His foot had just stepped out when over a dozen dark-black chains cut through the air. They carried a sharp, chilling aura that wrapped around all of his vital points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bastard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld Qing Hua immediately let out a quiet curse as these dark-black chains rushed over. However, he did not dare to easily slight them. The Dou Qi within his body surged out at this moment. Using his bare hands, he began a tough fight with that black-clothed Dou Zun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile old demon Qing Hua was being pestered, those two black-clothed Dou Zuns surrounded the dark-black, small fire dragon one behind the other in front. Their eyes exchanged a glance with one another, and their fingers were flickered. Ten somewhat tiny, dark-black chains rushed out of their sleeves with a clanging sound. After which, they ruthlessly rushed over to the essence flame of the Three Thousand Burning Flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe size of the small fire dragon was still quite impressive, about ten feet in size. Although its size was far inferior to its previous self, the vaguely present, destructive aura around it caused one to be afraid of underestimating it even a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fierce glint flashed over the eyes of the Three Thousand Burning Flame in the face of the combined attack of two black-clothed Dou Zuns. Today, it had escaped the seal of the three great heads with much difficulty. It was unexpected that it had been forced to leave its actual body by the fierce individuals of the Hall of Souls just after it escaped…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Puff!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dark-black flame covered the entire body of the Three Thousand Burning Flame. It swung its dragon tail, which transformed into a black lightning. It rushed toward the black-clothed Dou Zun in front of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat black-clothed Dou Zun was slightly shocked as he watched the Three Thousand Burning Flame retaliate. The fate of Old Mu Gu earlier had caused him to be afraid of underestimating the flame. Immediately, he swung his sleeves. Black fog surged and a countless number of dark-black chains gathered together. They were just like a giant python as it violently collided with the Three Thousand Burning Flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Clang clang clang!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe violent collision between both parties caused sparks to shoot out. Immediately, wave after wave of clear metallic sounds appeared. The fierce chain python completely split apart after facing the Three Thousand Burning Flame’s attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This beast is very strong!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the heart of this black-clothed Dou Zun was filled with caution, collapsing upon contact had somewhat exceeded his expectation. Immediately, his footsteps moved and his body hurriedly withdrew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, he had just showed signs of withdrawing when the space wiggled. The dark-black Three Thousand Burning Flame rushed out of the space. After which, it was accompanied by a destructive aura that shot toward the heart position of the black-clothed Dou Zun, like an arrow released from a bow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis extremely fierce attack of the Three Thousand Burning Flame had aroused a fierce aura within the heart of this black-clothed Dou Zun. Since when had he been forced into such a state during all these years?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis fierce aura had just surged in his heart when the black-clothed Dou Zun suddenly clenched his right fist. A vast, mighty, dark-black, chilly fog gushed of his body. After which, he threw out a merciless punch!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bang!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe punch heavily collided with the fire dragon. A thunderous explosion resounded over the Star Region. A hot fire wave swept out in a lightning-like fashion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grug!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe expression of the black-clothed Dou Zun changed almost instantly following the collision between the two. A mouthful of bright-red fresh blood was spat out. After this collision, he finally understood just how terrifying this Three Thousand Burning Flame was. Although the Three Thousand Burning Flame had been weakened after having experienced various battles, its annihilation strength still managed to destroy his defensea in an easy manner within a mere instant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe feet of the black-clothed Dou Zun continuously stepped back. A moment later, he finally stabilized his body in a somewhat miserable manner. His face was covered in shock. No wonder Old Mu Gu could not even receive a blow earlier. This destructive force was really too difficult to block.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the black-clothed Dou Zun was seriously injured, the dark-black flame of the Three Thousand Burning Flame had also become much darker. Clearly, that attack from earlier had exhausted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Attack, it will not be able to endure for long!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat black-clothed Dou Zun wiped off the blood dripping from the corner of his mouth. He saw the flame on the body of the Three Thousand Burning Flame suddenly become dimmer. A joy surged into his shocked eyes as he cried out to his companion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other Dou Zun from the Hall of Souls also nodded upon hearing this. However, after prior experience, they were much more careful. He waved his sleeves and countless numbers of spirits, covered by black fog, appeared. After which, they surged toward the Three Thousand Burning Flame from all directions. From the looks of it, he intended to use the soul explosion to completely exhaust the remaining strength of the Three Thousand Burning Flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough this tactic was a vicious one, it must be said that it was quite effective. Under the suicidal charge of the countless number of spirits, the Three Thousand Burning Flame could only continue to dodge. However, the deep-black flame on its body was gradually becoming paler. It appeared to show signs of returning to the kind of purple-black flame of the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Three Thousand Burning Flame continued to dodge the soul explosions as a furious roar reverberated through the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeeing this scene, Old Mu Gu and the black-clothed Dou Zun, who had suffered a great loss to the hands of the Three Thousand Burning Flame, also sighed in relief. If the four Dou Zuns were unable to deal with the Three Thousand Burning Flame despite acting together, they would definitely be punished when they returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan in the distance observed the Three Thousand Burning Flame being forced to dodge by the tactics of the Dou Zuns from the Hall of Soul. His eyes slowly narrowed. Currently, he could sense the Three Thousand Burning Flame growing weaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Things are bad. It is unexpected that these people from the Hall of Souls would be this vicious. They use such a tactic to exhaust the strength of the Three Thousand Burning Flame… if this continues, the Three Thousand Burning Flame will likely land in their hands.” Qiu Ling by the side spoke in a deep voice with an unusually grave expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Has teacher and the rest not freed themselves?” Cao Ying knit her brows and asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This Star Region cannot accommodate so many elite Dou Zuns. Originally, the Star Region should have collapsed soon after these people entered. However, from the looks of it, the three association heads are stabilizing it. I think that they should be able to split their attention and enter soon…” Qiu Ling replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What should we do? The Three Thousand Burning Flame looks like it will not be able to endure for long.” Chen Dan softly asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Leave it to me…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis sudden laugh caused Qiu Ling and the others to be startled. Their eyes immediately turned to Xiao Yan, only to see that he had a face full of smiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“First Elder Qiu Ling. Can I invite you to intervene and block Old Mu Gu and the other injured Dou Zun from the Hall of Souls?” Xiao Yan glanced around as he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Old Mu Gu and that black-clothed Dou Zun are seriously injured. It is not difficult to block them.” Qiu Ling hesitated before replying in a deep voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ke ke, in that case, I will have to trouble First Elder Qiu Ling with regards to the two of them. Leave the final Dou Zun from the Hall of Souls and the Three Thousand Burning Flames to me…” Xiao Yan slightly laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You… can you handle it?” Qiu Ling was startled when he heard Xiao Yan’s words. He immediately asked somewhat doubtfully. Although he did not have any comments about Xiao Yan’s pill refinement ability, this was currently not pill refinement. Instead, it was a real battle. From the looks of the aura of the Dou Zun from the Hall of Souls, who was fighting the Three Thousand Burning Flame, he should be an expert whose strength had reached that of a three star Dou Zun. With Xiao Yan’s strength, fighting him and dealing with the Three Thousand Burning Flame would not be a relaxing task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan smiled in the face of Qiu Ling’s doubt. He flicked his finger and a golden light suddenly rushed out of his Storage Ring. After which, it transformed into a golden human figure. It was surprisingly the Sky Demon Puppet that had evolved after having experienced numerous Pill Lightning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQiu Ling was startled upon seeing this Sky Demon Puppet with its golden luster. He slowly nodded. It was possible for him to sense a faint dangerous from it…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Since you are confident, I will leave the Three Thousand Burning Flame and the Dou Zun from the Hall of Souls to you. It will naturally be best if you have the confidence to subdue the Three Thousand Burning Flame…” Qiu Ling deeply looked at Xiao Yan. He was naturally aware that Xiao Yan was extremely interested in the Three Thousand Burning Flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan smiled as he nodded. He did not utter any additional unnecessary words. His feet stepped through empty space, and his body rushed in the direction of the Dou Zun from the Hall of Souls with lightning-like speed. The Sky Demon Puppet by his side transformed into a golden glow that followed close behind…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Three Thousand Burning Flame, you belong to me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fiery heat that was difficult to hide flashed across Xiao Yan’s eyes as he watched the small, black fire dragon!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1200\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1202\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1201","bookId":1497,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:54 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:54 AM"}
