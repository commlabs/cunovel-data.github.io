She looked at Su in a completely unrestrained manner, not hiding what she was thinking inside. Su hadn’t touched her for over ten days already, and for Li, this was completely unacceptable. Even though they separated themselves from Dragon City, this girl who was sometimes extremely simple, still considered herself Su’s subordinate. Since this was the case, how could he not pay her a salary? During the base’s cleanup, there was mutant stink and excrement everywhere, so not being in the mood was normal. Now that everything was heading in the right track, Su called her over to give her a reward, right?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eHowever, when Li looked around, she suddenly discovered that this place was open with refugees busily working nonstop. Even though she was daring, she still didn’t have a habit of letting these men who were all robust like bulls and pent up with desires see everything.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLi scratched her head, and then said in a somewhat embarrassed manner, “Leader, this place doesn’t seem suitable, there are too many people! Why don’t we go inside a tent?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Tent?” Only after thinking for a moment did Su realize Li’s intention, and as such, he laughed and said, “There’s no rush for these things. Right now, there is another matter…”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLi immediately felt extremely dejected, but when she saw Su take out a map, she knew that this was an important matter, so she still moved over with a pout.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Li, Steel Gate sent over an army to try and take over our base. They plan to set out today, the army possibly including around ten mobile armors, 500 ordinary soldiers, as well as 50 elites with at least three levels of ability. What do you think we should do?” Su asked. He knew that on military affairs, regardless of whether it was reasoning or tactics, he couldn’t beat Li.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eLi looked carefully at the map. In reality, ever since the day Su decided to establish their themselves in N69, she already gave the surrounding terrain a look through. She silently measured and calculated the distance for a bit, and then she asked, “Is there any information on the enemy’s high level ability users? How many are there? How many levels of ability do they have? Do we know what ability domains they are focused on?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“It is rumored that Steel Gate’s general Schneider is leading the army. He has seven levels in the Combat Domain. There are still three sixth level ability users.” Su said. Only now did he realize that the intelligence Victor gave him just now could be said to be quite detailed.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter understanding all of the other party’s military strength, Li was quite shocked, but she was definitely not terrified by the other party’s strength, instead, on the contrary, saying, “Just this bit of strength, yet they want to wipe us out? Even if they hid behind a fort, they still might not be able to handle our invasion, right?”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu released a rare laugh. He stroked Li’s hair and said, “This region west of the great lakes is not like the Black Dragonriders. The people here don’t seem to understand the concept of high level abilities that clearly.”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“That’s true I guess! All eight level ability users are freaks!” Li deeply understood the power of high level ability users and even personally experienced it through various methods. However, what left her with the deepest impression was not what she encountered from enemies, but rather Persephone. Back then, she just saw Persephone’s face, and then the next thing she knew, the world began to spin and her vision became blurred. An instant later, darkness covered everything. Li had thought that she had died, but only after a long time had passed did she realize that she had just been captured and tossed into a wardrobe. Even now, Li had no idea how Persephone was able to accomplish all of that in one or two seconds of time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eThat was why in Li’s heart, high level ability users, especially women, were all a hundred percent freaks.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eAfter hatefully coming to this conclusion, Li suddenly recalled some exceptions who didn’t have that powerful of abilities. She then angrily added, “Of course, there are freaks among people under eight levels as well!”\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003eSu was a bit surprised by Li’s sudden words, and as such, he patted her head and said, “Let’s not get off topic.

He looked at his own hand that was long, pure white, soft, and even a bit prettier than before. At the very least, it was comparable to Persephone and Madeline’s. Li was often fighting on the battlefield, so if they were to compare hands, hers was much inferior to Su’s.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Put your hand where it belongs!” Li was extremely blunt.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp dir\u003d\"ltr\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\"\u003e“Where I should put it?
