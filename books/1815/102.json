I hadn’t realized how badly I’d needed to hear him say that. “Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shifts, turning to face me. “And you’re married. Congratulations.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should come to the penthouse with me and meet my wife.” I’m anxious. I don’t want him to say no. There are so many things I want to say to him and we never have time. Only a few minutes here and there, snatches of conversation that can only scratch the surface. And with Eva there, I would have the courage to say what I needed to. “You’ll love her. She’s amazing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dad grins. “Beautiful, too. I’d like a grandson. And a granddaughter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whoa.” I laugh. “Let’s not move too fast.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Life moves fast, son. Before you know it, it’s over. Don’t waste it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallow past a hard lump in my throat. “You could’ve had more time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s not what I want to say. I want to ask him why he gave up, why he checked out. But I’m afraid of the answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All the time in the world wouldn’t have seen me build something like this.” He looks back up at the Crossfire. From the ground, it seems to reach to infinity, an optical illusion created by the pyramid at the top. “It’ll be a lot of work, keeping this standing. Same with a marriage. Eventually, you’ll have to put one before the other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think about that. Is it true? I shake my head. “We’ll keep it standing together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slaps a hand on my shoulder and the ground reverberates beneath my feet. It starts out faintly, then builds, until glass begins to rain down around us. Horrified, I watch as the distant spire at the top explodes outward, then radiates down, windows bursting under the pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI woke with a gasp, breathing hard, pushing at the weight on my chest and feeling warm fur. Blinking, I found Lucky climbing over me, low whimpers rumbling in his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus.” I sat up and shoved my hair back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEva slept beside me, curled in a ball with her hands tucked beneath her chin. Through the windows beyond her, I saw the sun was fading fast. A quick glance at the clock told me it was just past five in the evening. My alarm had been set for quarter past the hour, so I reached for my smartphone to turn it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky shoved his head beneath my forearm. Picking him up, I held him at eye level. “You did it again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d woken me from a nightmare. Who the fuck knew if he was doing it consciously or not? I was grateful either way. I gave him a brisk rubdown and slid out of bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you getting up?” Eva asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have to go to Dr. Petersen’s.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, yeah. Forgot about that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d debated skipping the appointment, but Eva and I would be leaving for our honeymoon soon and I wouldn’t see the good doctor for a month. I figured I could tough it out until then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set Lucky down on the floor and started for the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” she called after me. “I invited Chris over for dinner tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy stride faltered, then halted. Turning, I faced her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t look at me like that.” She sat up, rubbing her eyes with her fists. “He’s lonely, Gideon. He’s on his own, without his family. It’s a rough time for him. I figured I’d make something simple for dinner and we could watch a movie. Take his mind off the divorce for a while, maybe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. That was my wife. Always circling the wagons around the lost and wounded. How could I fault her for being the woman I’d fallen in love with? “Fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. It was worth going along with anything, just to see that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just finished watching your interview,” Dr. Petersen said, as he settled into his armchair. “My wife told me about it earlier and I was able to catch it on the Internet. Very well done. I enjoyed it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTugging up my slacks, I sank onto the sofa. “A necessary evil, but I agree, it went well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How’s Eva?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you asking me how she reacted to seeing that photo?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Petersen smiled. “I can imagine the reaction. How is she doing now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s okay.” I was still shaken by the memory of hearing her being so violently ill. “We’re good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich didn’t change the fact that I seethed with fury every time I thought of it. That photo had existed for months. Why hold on to it, then release it now? It would have made news in May.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only answer I could come up with was that they’d wanted to hurt Eva. Maybe put a wedge between us. They wanted to humiliate her and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone was going to pay for that. When I was done, they’d know what hell felt like. They would suffer, the way Eva and I had suffered. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-with-you-crossfire-5/page-102.html","bookId":1815,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:48 PM"}
