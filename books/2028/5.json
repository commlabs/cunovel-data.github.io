Why it doesn\u0027t seem to matter to Riley if it\u0027s someone like you or if it\u0027s someone like that idiot Kevin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sounded like he didn\u0027t know Riley any better than I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean, someone like me?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re the kind that Riley should be looking for - the smart ones - not just these stupid gang-bangers that Raoul keeps bringing in. I bet you weren\u0027t some junkie ho when you were human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shifted uneasily at the last word. Diego kept waiting for my answer, like he hadn\u0027t said anything weird. I took a deep breath and thought back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was close enough,\" I admitted after a few seconds of his patient watching. \"Not there yet, but in a few more weeks...\" I shrugged. \"You know, I don\u0027t remember much, but I do remember thinking there was nothing more powerful on this planet than just plain old hunger. Turns out, thirst is worst.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"Sing it, sister.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about you? You weren\u0027t a troubled teen runaway like the rest of us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I was troubled, al right.\" He stopped talking. But I could sit around and wait for the answers to inappropriate questions, too. I just stared at him. He sighed. The scent of his breath was nice. Everybody smel ed sweet, but Diego had a little something extra - some spice like cinnamon or cloves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tried to stay away from al that junk. Studied hard. I was gonna get out of the ghetto, you know. Go to col ege. Make something of myself. But there was a guy - not much different than Raoul. Join or die, that was his motto. I wasn\u0027t having any, so I stayed away from his group. I was careful. Stayed alive.\" He stopped, closing his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t done being pushy. \"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My kid brother wasn\u0027t as careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was about to ask if his brother had joined or died, but the expression on his face made asking unnecessary. I looked away, not sure how to respond. I couldn\u0027t real y understand his loss, the pain it stil clearly caused him to feel. I hadn\u0027t left anything behind that I stil missed. Was that the difference? Was that why he dwel ed on memories that the rest of us shunned?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stil didn\u0027t see how Riley came into this. Riley and the cheeseburger of pain. I wanted that part of the story, but now I felt bad for pushing him to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucky for my curiosity, Diego kept going after a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I kind of lost it. Stole a gun from a friend and went hunting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled darkly. \"Wasn\u0027t as good at it then. But I got the guy that got my brother before they got me. The rest of his crew had me cornered in an al ey. Then, suddenly, Riley was there, between me and them. I remember thinking he was the whitest guy I\u0027d ever seen. He didn\u0027t even look at the others when they shot him. Like the bul ets were flies. You know what he said to me? He said, ��Want a new life, kid?\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hah!\" I laughed. \"That\u0027s way better than mine. Al I got was,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e��Want a burger, kid?\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stil remembered how Riley\u0027d looked that night, though the image was al blurry because my eyes\u0027d sucked back then. He was the hottest boy I\u0027d ever seen, tal and blond and perfect, every feature. I knew his eyes must be just as beautiful behind the dark sunglasses he never took off. And his voice was so gentle, so kind. I figured I knew what he would want in exchange for the meal, and I would have given it to him, too. Not because he was so pretty to look at, but because I hadn\u0027t eaten anything but trash for two weeks. It turned out he wanted something else, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiego laughed at the burger line. \"You must have been pretty hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn straight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So why were you so hungry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I was stupid and ran away before I had a driver\u0027s license. I couldn\u0027t get a real job, and I was a bad thief.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were you running from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated. The memories were a little more clear as I focused on them, and I wasn\u0027t sure I wanted that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, c\u0027mon,\" he coaxed. \"I told you mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, you did. Okay. I was running from my dad. He used to knock me around a lot. Probably did the same to my mom before she took off. I was pretty little then - I didn\u0027t know much. It got worse. I figured if I waited too long I\u0027d end up dead. He told me if I ever ran away I\u0027d starve. He was right about that - only thing he was ever right about as far as I\u0027m concerned. I don\u0027t think about it much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiego nodded in agreement. \"Hard to remember that stuff, isn\u0027t it? Everything\u0027s so fuzzy and dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like trying to see with mud in your eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good way to put it,\" he complimented me. He squinted at me like he was trying to see, and rubbed his eyes. We laughed together again. Weird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve laughed with anybody since I met Riley,\" he said, echoing my thoughts. \"This is nice. You\u0027re nice. Not like the others. You ever try to have a conversation with one of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope, I haven\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not missing anything. Which is my point. Wouldn\u0027t Riley\u0027s standard of living be a little higher if he surrounded himself with decent vampires? If we\u0027re supposed to protect her, shouldn\u0027t he be looking for the smart ones?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So Riley doesn\u0027t need brains,\" I reasoned. \"He needs numbers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiego pursed his lips, considering. \"Like chess. He\u0027s not making knights and bishops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re just pawns,\" I realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stared at each other again for a long minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to think that,\" Diego said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what do we do?\" I asked, using the plural automatical y. Like we were already a team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought about my question for a second, seeming uneasy, and I regretted the \"we.\" But then he said, \"What can we do when we don\u0027t know what\u0027s happening?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he didn\u0027t mind the team thing, which made me feel real y good in a way I didn\u0027t remember ever feeling before. \"I guess we keep our eyes open, pay attention, try to figure it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"We need to think about everything Riley\u0027s told us, everything he\u0027s done.\" He paused thoughtful y. \"You know, I tried to hash some of this out with Riley once, but he couldn\u0027t have cared less. Told me to keep my mind on more important things - like thirst. Which was al I could think about then, of course. He sent me out hunting, and I stopped worrying....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched him thinking about Riley, his eyes unfocused as he relived the memory, and I wondered. Diego was my first friend in this life, but I wasn\u0027t his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly his focus snapped back to me. \"So what have we learned from Riley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI concentrated, running through the last three months in my head. \"He real y doesn\u0027t tel us much, you know. Just the vampire basics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027l have to listen more careful y.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sat in silence, pondering this. I mostly thought about how much I didn\u0027t know. And why hadn\u0027t I worried about everything I didn\u0027t know before now? It was like talking to Diego had cleared my head. For the first time in three months, blood was not the main thing in there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence lasted for a while. The black hole I\u0027d felt funneling fresh air into the cave wasn\u0027t black anymore. It was dark gray now and getting infinitesimal y lighter with each second. Diego noticed me eyeing it nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" he said. \"Some dim light gets in here on sunny days. It doesn\u0027t hurt.\" He shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scooted closer to the hole in the floor, where the water was disappearing as the tide went out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seriously, Bree. I\u0027ve been down here before during the day. I told Riley about this cave - and how it was mostly fil ed with water, and he said it was cool when I needed to get out of the madhouse. Anyway, do I look like I got singed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated, thinking about how different his relationship with Riley was than mine. His eyebrows rose, waiting for an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I final y said. \"But...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look,\" he said impatiently. He crawled swiftly to the tunnel and stuck his arm in up to the shoulder. \"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relax! Do you want me to see how high I can go?\" As he spoke, he stuck his head into the hole and started climbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t, Diego.\" He was already out of sight. \"I\u0027m relaxed, I swear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was laughing - it sounded like he was already several yards up the tunnel. I wanted to go after him, to grab his foot and yank him back, but I was frozen with stress. It would be stupid to risk my life to save some total stranger. But I hadn\u0027t had anything close to a friend in forever. Already it would be hard to go back to having no one to talk to, after only one night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No estoy quemando,\" he cal ed down, his tone teasing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait... is that...? Ow! \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Diego?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaped across the cave and stuck my head into the tunnel. His face was right there, inches from mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boo!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flinched back from his proximity - just a reflex, old habit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Funny,\" I said dryly, moving away as he slid back into the cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to unwind, girl. I\u0027ve looked into this, okay? Indirect sunlight doesn\u0027t hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re saying that I could just stand under a nice shady tree and be fine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated for a minute, as if debating whether or not to tel me something, and then said quietly, \"I did once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him, waiting for the grin. Because this was a joke. It didn\u0027t come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Riley said...,\" I started, and then my voice trailed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I know what Riley said,\" he agreed. \"Maybe Riley doesn\u0027t know as much as he says he does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Shel y and Steve. Doug and Adam. That kid with the bright red hair. Al of them. They\u0027re gone because they didn\u0027t get back in time. Riley saw the ashes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiego\u0027s brows pul ed together unhappily. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-short-second-life-of-bree-tanner-twilight-4/page-5.html","bookId":2028,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:18:47 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:18:47 PM"}
