Ears, I mean.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She had one ear on each side of her head, just like most people. But she also had a third ear, which lay flat on top of her head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e You couldn\u0027t see it. It was completely covered by her thick, frizzy brown hair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She was an intelligent and lovely young woman. She was gentle and kind.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At least, she used to be. Then she met Xavier and became evil and wicked, but I\u0027ll get to that later.\n\u003cbr\u003e 124\n\u003cbr\u003e She lived in a small apartment in the big city. She always kept fresh flowers in the vase on her kitchen table.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She didn\u0027t have any friends. She was afraid someone might find out about her ear. She was very embarrassed by it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The one on top of her head, I mean. The other two ears were pretty, as ears go.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Actually, the third ear wasn\u0027t ugly. In fact, it looked just like her other two.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was quantity, not quality, that bothered her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then she met Xavier.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was at a museum. They happened to be standing next to each other looking at the same painting. The Mona Lisa.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A guard stood by to make sure they didn\u0027t touch it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Xavier was very handsome. But he was frightfully shy. He was afraid of women.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s a beautiful painting, isn\u0027t it?\" said Wendy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Xavier blushed. He wanted to speak, but his mouth locked shut with fear. It took all his courage just to nod his head.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But Wendy knew he liked her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Because there was something else about her ear I haven\u0027t told you yet. The one on top of her head, I mean.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It didn\u0027t hear normal sounds. It heard people\u0027s brains,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wendy was able to listen to Xavier\u0027s secret thoughts. And this is what she heard.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Yes, the painting is very beautiful. But you are more beautiful than the Mona Lisa. I wish somebody would paint your picture. I would buy it and look at it all day. Alas, if only I had the courage to talk to you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wendy didn\u0027t usually listen to other people\u0027s thoughts. She thought it was rude, even though the other people didn\u0027t know she was listening.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Besides, most people\u0027s thoughts were usually boring.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Xavier was getting too nervous standing next to her. He moved on to another painting.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wendy followed him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She listened to the lonely man\u0027s thoughts. They weren\u0027t boring at all. Most of his thoughts were about her, but she also learned a few other things. He liked to read. His favorite author was Charles Dickens. He loved animals, especially dogs.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That painting reminds me of a book,\" said Wendy. \"A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens. Have you read it?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes!\" Xavier blurted, a little too loudly. \"It\u0027s my favorite book! I\u0027ve read everything Dickens has\n\u003cbr\u003e 126\n\u003cbr\u003e written. Twice. My favorite part is when-\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He suddenly stopped, very embarrassed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Please go on,\" said Wendy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, I don\u0027t want to bother you,\" said Xavier.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re not bothering me,\" said Wendy. \"Charles Dickens is my favorite author. I sometimes read aloud to my dog.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You have a dog?\" asked Xavier.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wendy nodded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Xavier stared into her dark eyes. \"I love dogs,\" he said, as his brain said, I love you.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wendy and Xavier spent the afternoon together. He could hardly stop talking.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was like a genie had escaped from a bottle. All the love and emotion that had been buried for so long inside him came pouring out on Wendy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t even know your name,\" he suddenly blurted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wendy Nogard,\" said Wendy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m Xavier Dalton,\" said Xavier.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They shook hands and made plans to meet again at the museum the following week.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On her way home, Wendy stopped by the library and checked out A Tale of Two Cities. Then she went to the pet store and bought a dog.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A month later Xavier asked her to marry him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wendy didn\u0027t know what to say. She loved Xavier. And she knew he loved her. But she still hadn\u0027t told him about her ear.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The one on top of her head, I mean.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He knew about the other two. He had nibbled on each of them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Marriage is a big step,\" she said. \"I\u0027m afraid we haven\u0027t known each other long enough.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ve known you long enough to know I could never be happy without you,\" said Xavier. \"Before I met you, Wendy, I was sad and lonely. But I was used to it. Now I can\u0027t imagine living like that again. I don\u0027t know what I\u0027d do without you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He stroked her hair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, there\u0027s one little thing you don\u0027t know about me,\" said Wendy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e His hand bumped into it. \"What\u0027s this thing?\" he asked.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s what I was going to tell you about, dear,\" said Wendy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Xavier parted Wendy\u0027s hair and looked at it. \"It\u0027s an ear!\" he exclaimed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, it is,\" said Wendy. \"Some people have two ears. I have three. Now that you know, if you still want to marry me, my answer is yes! Yes, sweetheart yes!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I love you,\" said Xavier. \"That\u0027s all that matters to me.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That was what he said. But this is what he was thinking.\n\u003cbr\u003e 128\n\u003cbr\u003e Oh, gross! You\u0027re disgusting! I never want to touch you again! I can\u0027t even stand to look at you! You tricked me, you freak! You monster!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And of course Wendy heard every word.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He stood up. \"I\u0027ll be right back, sweetheart. I bought you diamond earrings as an engagement present. I just need to run back to the jewelry store and buy one more.\" He hurried out the door.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She never saw him again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m sorry to say this story has a sad ending.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Xavier, thanks to Wendy, got over his shyness. He went out with lots of women but broke each one\u0027s heart. He could never love any of them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was a hole in his heart. He was in love with Wendy Nogard, but he didn\u0027t know it. And so he could never be happy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wendy became a bitter and evil person. She was unhappy, and she wanted everyone else to be unhappy too.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Whenever she heard someone thinking happy thoughts, she would listen closely and then do and say just the right thing to make the person feel rotten.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She hated children the most. Every time she passed a playground, she heard them laughing and having fun.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So she became a substitute teacher.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1990/56939.html","bookId":676,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 2:24:18 PM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 1:28:54 PM"}
