It had been a long flight, and Tucker should have been exhausted, but instead he was exhilarated. Ellen Scott was not a woman given to whims. There\u0027s something strange going on behind all this, Alan Tucker thought, and if I play my cards right, I have a hunch it could be very profitable for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe checked into the Cuatro Postes hotel and said to the clerk behind the desk, \"Is there a newspaper office around here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Down the street, senor. To your left, two blocks. You can\u0027t miss it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"De nada.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking down the main street, watching the town come alive after its afternoon siesta, Tucker thought about the mysterious girl he had been sent to bring back. This had to be something important. But important why? He could hear Ellen Scott\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf she\u0027s alive, bring her back to me. You are not to discuss this with anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, ma\u0027am. What shall I tell her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimply tell her that a friend of her father\u0027s wishes to meet her. She\u0027ll come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker found the newspaper office. Inside, he approached one of the half dozen people working behind desks. \"Perdone, I would like to see the managing editor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man pointed to an office. \"In there, senor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gracias.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker walked over to the open door and looked inside. A man in his mid-thirties was seated behind a desk, busily editing copy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me,\" Tucker said. \"Could I speak to you for a moment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man looked up. \"What can I do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m looking for a senorita.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe editor smiled. \"Aren\u0027t we all, senor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was left at a farmhouse around here when she was an infant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smile faded. \"Oh. She was abandoned?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you are trying to find her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many years ago would that be, senor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-eight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young man shrugged. \"It was before my time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps it\u0027s not going to be so easy. \"Could you suggest someone who might be able to help me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe editor leaned back in his chair, thinking. \"As a matter of fact, I can. I would suggest you speak with Father Berrendo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Berrendo sat in his study, a lap robe over his thin legs, listening to the stranger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Alan Tucker was finished explaining why he was there, Father Berrendo said, \"Why do you wish to know about this matter, senor? It happened so long ago. What is your interest in it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker hesitated, choosing his words carefully. \"I am not at liberty to say. I can only assure you that I mean the woman no harm. If you could just tell me where the farmhouse is where she was left - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe farmhouse. Memories came flooding back of the day the Morases had come to him after they had taken the little girl to the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think she\u0027s dying, Father. What shall we do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Berrendo telephoned his friend Don Morago, the chief of police.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think the baby was abandoned by tourists visiting avila. Could you check the hotels and inns and see if anyone arrived with a baby and left without one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe police went through the registration cards that all hotels were required to fill out, but they were of no help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is as if the baby just dropped out of the sky,\" Don Morago had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he had had no idea of how close he had come to solving the mystery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Father Berrendo took the infant to the orphanage, Mercedes Angeles had asked, \"Does the baby have a name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wasn\u0027t there a blanket or something with the name on it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMercedes Angeles looked at the infant in the priest\u0027s arms. \"Well, we\u0027ll just have to give her a name, won\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had recently finished reading a romantic novel, and she liked the name of the heroine in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Megan,\" she said. \"We\u0027ll call her Megan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd fourteen years later, Father Berrendo had taken Megan to the Cistercian convent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo many years after that, this stranger was looking for her. Life always comes full circle, Father Berrendo thought. In some mysterious way, it has come full circle for Megan. No, not Megan. That was the name given her by the orphanage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down, senor,\" Father Berrendo said. \"There is much to tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the priest was finished, Alan Tucker sat there quietly, his mind racing. There had to be a very good reason for Ellen Scott\u0027s interest in a baby abandoned at a farmhouse in Spain twenty-eight years earlier. A woman now called Megan, according to the priest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell her that a friend of her father\u0027s wishes to meet her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he remembered correctly, Byron Scott and his wife and daughter had died in an airplane crash many years ago somewhere in Spain. Could there be a connection? Alan Tucker felt a growing sense of excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Father - I\u0027d like to get into the convent to see her. It\u0027s very important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe priest shook his head. \"I\u0027m afraid you are too late. The convent was attacked two days ago by agents of the government.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan Tucker stared at him. \"Attacked? What happened to the nuns?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were arrested and taken to Madrid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan Tucker got to his feet. \"Thank you, Father.\" He would catch the first plane to Madrid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFather Berrendo went on. \"Four of the nuns escaped. Sister Megan was one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings were becoming complicated. \"Where is she now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one knows. The police and the army are searching for her and the other sisters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\" Under ordinary circumstances, Alan Tucker would have telephoned Ellen Scott and informed her that he had reached a dead end. But all his instincts as a detective told him there was something here that warranted further investigation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe placed a call to Ellen Scott.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a complication, Mrs. Scott.\" He repeated his conversation with the priest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long silence. \"No one knows where she is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She and the others are on the run, but they can\u0027t hide out much longer. The police and half the Spanish army are looking for them. When they surface, I\u0027ll be there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother silence. \"This is very important to me, Tucker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Mrs. Scott.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlan Tucker returned to the newspaper office. He was in luck. It was still open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said to the editor, \"I would like to look through your files, if I may.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you looking for something in particular?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. There was an airplane crash here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How long ago, senor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty-eight years ago. Nineteen forty-eight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took Alan Tucker fifteen minutes to find the item he was looking for. The headline leaped out at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePLANE CRASH KILLS EXECUTIVE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFAMILY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOctober 1, 1948. Byron Scott, President of Scott Industries, his wife, Susan, and their one-year old daughter, Patricia, were burned to death in an airplane crash...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve hit the jackpot! He could feel his pulse begin to race. If this is what I think it is, I\u0027m going to be a rich man...a very rich man. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sands-of-time/page-19.html","bookId":2361,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:56 AM"}
