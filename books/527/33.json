{"id":23141,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIII. A MIDNIGHT ATTACK.","content":"O LIVER and his guardian retired about ten o\u0027clock. Mr. Bundy was not long in going to sleep. Unlike Oliver, he had no care or anxiety on his mind. As we have said, he was not a man to harbor suspicion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With our hero it was different. He knew the real character of Denton, and could not help fancying that he must have some personal object in bringing them to this house, and installing them in a room adjoining his own.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Oliver carefully locked the door, leaving the key in the lock. There was but one door, and this led into the hall.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now,\" thought our hero, \"Denton can\u0027t get in except through the keyhole.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This ought to have quieted him for the night, but it did not. An indefinable suspicion, which he could not explain, made him uneasy. It was this, probably, that prompted him to go to the closet in which he knew that Nicholas Bundy kept a pistol. At times he placed the pistol under his pillow, but he had not done so to-night, considering it quite unnecessary in a quiet boarding-house.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t suppose there\u0027s any need of it,\" thought Oliver; \"but I\u0027ll take it and put it under my own pillow.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nicholas Bundy was already asleep. He was a sound sleeper and did not observe what Oliver was doing, otherwise he would have asked an explanation.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This might have been hard to give, except the chance knowledge he had gained of Denton\u0027s character.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e An hour passed and still Oliver remained awake. At about this time he heard a noise in the adjoining room as of someone moving about.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is Denton come home,\" he said to himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Presently the noise ceased, and Oliver concluded that his disreputable neighbor had gone to bed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He began to be rather ashamed of his suspicions.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course he can\u0027t get in here, since there is but one door, and that locked,\" he reflected. \"It is foolish for me to lie awake all night. I may as well imitate Mr. Bundy\u0027s example and go to sleep.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Oliver was himself fatigued, having been about the streets all day, and now that his anxiety was relieved he, too, soon fell into a slumber. But his sleep was neither deep nor refreshing; it was troubled by dreams, or rather by one dream, in which Denton figured.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was this, perhaps, that broke the bonds of sleep. At any rate, he found himself almost in an instant broad awake, with his eyes resting on a figure, clearly seen in the moonlight, standing beside Nicholas Bundy\u0027s bed examining the pockets of his coat and pantaloons, which rested on a chair close beside.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Immediately all his senses were on the alert. In one swift glance he saw all. The figure was that of Denton, and an opening in the panel between the two rooms showed how he had got in. It was clear that this was a decoy house, especially intended to admit of such nefarious deeds.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Denton\u0027s back was turned to Oliver, and he was quite unaware, therefore, that the boy had awakened. Bundy lay before him in profound sleep, and from a careless glance he had concluded that the boy also was asleep.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now,\" thought Oliver, \"what shall I do? Shall I shoot at once?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This course was repugnant to him. He had a horror of shedding blood unless it were absolutely necessary, but at the same time he was bold and resolute, and by no means willing to lie quietly and see his guardian robbed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was certainly a critical moment, and required some courage to face and defy a midnight robber, who might himself be armed. But Oliver was plucky, and didn\u0027t shrink.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e In a clear, distinct voice he asked:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What are you doing there?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Denton wheeled round and saw Oliver sitting up in bed. He had a black mask over his eyes, and thought he was not recognized.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Confusion!\" Oliver heard him mutter, under his breath. \"Cover up your head, boy, and don\u0027t interfere with me, or I\u0027ll murder you!\" he said in a low, stern voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I want to know what you are doing?\" demanded our hero, undaunted.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"None of your business. Do as I tell you!\" answered Denton, in a menacing tone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It is my business,\" said Oliver firmly. \"You have no business here, Mr. Denton. Go back into your own room.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Denton started, and was visibly annoyed to find that he was recognized after all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Denton is not my name,\" he said. \"You mistake me for somebody else.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Denton is the name by which we know you,\" said Oliver. \"Whether it is your real name or not I don\u0027t know or care. I know you have no business here, and you must leave instantly.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Denton laughed, a low, mocking laugh.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You crow well, my young bantam,\" he said; \"but you\u0027re a fool, or you would know that I am not a man to be trifled with. Cover up your head, and in five minutes you may uncover it again, and I will do you no harm.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, but you\u0027ll rob Mr. Bundy, and I don\u0027t intend you shall do it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You don\u0027t!\" exclaimed the ruffian, in a tone of suppressed passion. \"Come, I must teach you a lesson!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He sprang toward Oliver\u0027s bed, with the evident intention of doing him an injury, but our hero was prompt and prepared for the attack which he anticipated. He seized the pistol and presented it full at the approaching burglar, and said coolly:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Don\u0027t be in a hurry, Mr. Denton. This pistol is loaded, and if you touch me I will shoot.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Denton stopped short, with a feeling bordering on dismay. It was a resistance he had not anticipated. Indeed, he was so far from expecting any interference with his designs that he had come unprovided with any weapon himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The boy\u0027s fooling me!\" it occurred to him. \"I don\u0027t believe the pistol is loaded. I\u0027ll find out. You must be a fool to think I am afraid of an empty pistol,\" he said, looking searchingly at the boy\u0027s face.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You will find out whether it is loaded or not,\" said Oliver coolly; \"but I wouldn\u0027t advise you to try. Just go through the same door you came in at, and I won\u0027t shoot.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e If it had been a man, Denton would have seen that there was no further chance for him to carry out his design; but it angered him to give in to a boy. He felt that it was disgraceful to a man, whose strength could outmatch Oliver twice over. Besides, he had felt Bundy\u0027s pocket-book, and he hated to leave the room without it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll bribe the boy,\" he thought. \"Look here, boy,\" said he; \"put down that weapon of yours. I want to speak to you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Go ahead!\" said Oliver.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You haven\u0027t laid down your pistol.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And I don\u0027t intend to,\" said Oliver firmly. \"I am not in the habit of entertaining company in my chamber at midnight, and I prefer to be on my guard.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Denton was enraged at the boy\u0027s coolness, but he dissembled the feeling.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, well,\" he said carelessly, \"do as you please. Now, I\u0027ve got a proposal to make to you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Go ahead.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m very hard up, and I want money.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So I supposed.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The man you\u0027re with has plenty of it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"How do you know?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Confound you, why do you interrupt me? You know it as well as I. Now, I want some of that money.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That is what you came in for.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, that is what I came in for. Now, I\u0027ll tell you what I will do. I will take the money out of the pocketbook, and give you half, if you won\u0027t interfere. You can tell the old man that a burglar took the whole, and he\u0027ll believe you fast enough. So you see you will profit by it as well as I.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You don\u0027t know me, Mr. Denton,\" said Oliver. \"I am not a thief, and if I were I wouldn\u0027t rob the man that has been kind to me. I\u0027ve heard all I want to, and you have stayed in this room long enough. If you don\u0027t disappear through that panel before I count three, I\u0027ll shoot you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e With a muttered execration, Denton obeyed, and once more Oliver found himself alone. He got up and looked at his watch. It indicated a quarter to one. What should he do? The night was less than half-spent, and Denton might attempt another entrance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"There is no help for it,\" thought Oliver. \"I must remain awake the rest of the night.\"\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2088/59240.html","bookId":527,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 3:23:36 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 3:23:36 PM"}
