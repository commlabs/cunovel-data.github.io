I was so very scared, Jenny, and he\u0027s so huge, and so fierce, and I couldn\u0027t s-stop crying, which only p-pro-provoked him more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t cry,\" Jenny soothed. \"It\u0027s all over now,\" she lied. Lying, she thought sadly, was beginning to come very easily to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan threw back the flap of Royce\u0027s tent and walked inside. \"My God, she\u0027s a beauty,\" he said, referring to Brenna, who had just departed. \"Too bad she\u0027s a nun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s not,\" Royce snapped irritably. \"She managed, between bouts of weeping, to explain she\u0027s a \u0027novice.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce Westmoreland was a battle-hardened warrior whose firsthand knowledge of religious rights was virtually nonexistent. His entire world, since he was a boy, had been military, and so he translated Brenna\u0027s tearful explanation into military terms he understood: \"Apparently, a novice is a volunteer who hasn\u0027t completed his training or sworn fealty to his liege lord yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you believe she tells the truth about that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce grimaced and swallowed more of his ale. \"She\u0027s too frightened to lie. For that matter, she\u0027s too frightened to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStefan\u0027s eyes narrowed in what might have been jealousy over the girl or merely annoyance at his brother\u0027s failure to learn more of value. \"And too beautiful to question too harshly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce sent him a sardonic look, but his mind was on the matter at hand. \"I want to know how well fortified Merrick castle is, as well as the lay of its land—anything we can learn that will be of help. Otherwise, you\u0027ll have to make that trip to Merrick you started on yesterday.\" He set the tankard down with a resolute thud upon the trestle table. \"Have the sister brought to me,\" he said with deathly finality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrenna scooted backward in terror when the giant, Arik, entered their tent, the earth seeming to tremble with each of his footsteps. \"Nay, please,\" she whispered desperately. \"Don\u0027t take me back before him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring Brenna completely, he stalked over to Jenny, clenched her arm in his enormous fist and hauled her to her feet. Legend, Jenny realized a little hysterically, had not exaggerated the size of Arik\u0027s war axe: its handle was as thick as a stout tree limb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Wolf was pacing restlessly within the confines of his large tent, but he stopped abruptly when Jenny was thrust inside, his silver eyes raking over her as she stood proudly erect, her hands bound behind her. Although her face was carefully expressionless, Royce was amazed to see veiled contempt in the blue eyes staring defiantly into his. Contempt—and not a trace of tears. Suddenly he recalled what he\u0027d heard of Merrick\u0027s eldest girl. The younger was called the \"Jewel of Scotland,\" but legend had it that this one was a cold, proud heiress with a dowry so rich, and bloodlines so noble, that no man was above her touch. Not only that, she was purported to be a plain girl who\u0027d scorned the only offer of marriage she was likely to receive and had then been sent to a nunnery by her father. With her face streaked all over with dirt, it was impossible to tell how \"plain\" she was, but she certainly didn\u0027t possess her sister\u0027s angelic beauty and temperament. The other girl had wept piteously—this one was glaring at him. \"God\u0027s teeth, are you truly sisters?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer chin lifted higher. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amazing,\" he said in a derisive voice. \"Are you full sisters?\" he asked suddenly as if puzzled. \"Answer me!\" he snapped when she remained stubbornly silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny, who was far more terrified than she showed, suddenly doubted he meant to torture her or put her to death at the end of an interview which began with innocuous questions about her genealogy. \"She is my stepsister,\" she admitted, and then a spurt of defiant courage overcame her terror. \"I find it difficult to concentrate on anything when my wrists are bound behind me. It\u0027s painful and unnecessary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right,\" he remarked with deliberate crudity, recalling she\u0027d kicked him in the groin. \"It\u0027s your feet that should be bound.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounded so disgruntled that amused satisfaction made her lips twitch. Royce saw it and could not believe his eyes. Grown men, warriors, quailed in his presence, but this young girl with the haughty stance and stubborn chin was actually enjoying defying him. His curiosity and his patience abruptly evaporated. \"Enough polite trivialities,\" he said sharply, advancing slowly on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny\u0027s amusement vanished and she retreated a step, then she stopped and made herself hold her ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want answers to some questions. How many men-at-arms does your father keep at Merrick castle?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Jenny said flatly, then she spoiled the effect of her bravado by taking another cautious step backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does your father think I mean to march on him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re trying my patience,\" he warned in a silky, ominous voice. \"Would you prefer I ask these questions of your tender little sister instead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat threat had the desired effect; her defiant expression turned desperate. \"Why wouldn\u0027t he think you\u0027re going to attack him? For years, there have been rumors that you\u0027re going to do it. Now, you have an excuse! Not that you need one.\" Jennifer cried, frightened past all reason when he began advancing on her again. \"You\u0027re an animal! You enjoy killing innocent people!\" When he didn\u0027t deny that he enjoyed it, Jenny felt her insides cringe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now that you know that much,\" he said in a dangerously soft voice, \"suppose you tell me how many men-at-arms your father has?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny hastily calculated that there must be at least 500 left. \"Two hundred,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You stupid, reckless little fool!\" Royce hissed, grabbing her arms and giving her a hard shake. \"I could break you in half with my bare hands, yet you still lie to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you expect me to do?\" Jenny cried, quaking all over, but still stubborn. \"Betray my own father to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before you leave this tent,\" he promised, \"you\u0027ll tell me what you know of his plans—willingly or with some help from me you won\u0027t enjoy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know how many men he\u0027s gathered,\" Jenny cried helplessly. \"It\u0027s true,\" she flung out. \"Until yesterday, my father hadn\u0027t seen me in two years, and before that he rarely spoke to me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat answer so took Royce by surprise that he stared at her. \"Why not?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-kingdom-of-dreams-westmoreland-saga-1/page-9.html","bookId":1848,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:10 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:03:10 PM"}
