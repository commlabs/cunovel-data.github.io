Everybody hated everybody-except Miss Nogard. They all liked her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But then a miracle happened.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A new kid came to school.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The new kid couldn\u0027t talk. She had no teeth. She was almost bald.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She was beautiful.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her name was Mavis Jewls.

Mrs. Jewls gently laid her baby down in it on soft yellow blankets.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Everyone crowded around the little stranger.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Look at her totally tiny toes!\" Bebe squealed. \"Aren\u0027t those the cutest things you\u0027ve ever seen in your whole life?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Check out her nose!\" said Myron.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, she\u0027s so beautiful, Mrs. Jewls,\" said Joy. \"Can I touch her?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sure,\" said Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They took turns touching the baby.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Goo-goo, goo-goo,\" said Mac as he gently shook Mavis\u0027s little hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Iggle wiggle poo poo,\" said Allison, tapping her on the nose.\n\u003cbr\u003e 164\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Iggle wiggle poo poo poo,\" said Rondi, tickling her foot\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yibble bibble,\" said Todd.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ooh goo boo boo,\" cooed Joe.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She\u0027s never going to learn to talk around you kids,\" said Mrs. Jewls with a laugh.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dana was so happy she cried.

That\u0027s kind of dangerous, Miss Nogard realized. Somebody might accidentally drop something out the window.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She slowly moved toward it as she swayed with the baby. \"I\u0027ve heard so much about you, Mrs. Jewls,\" she said. \"The children have missed you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ve missed them too,\" said Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was a rubber-band ball on the floor next to Shane\u0027s desk.

Then she fainted in Louis\u0027s arms.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It is impossible to describe, in words, exactly what Miss Nogard heard when she listened to Mavis\u0027s brain.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Babies don\u0027t think in words.\n\u003cbr\u003e 166\n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Nogard heard pure love. And trust. And faith. With no words to get in the way.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a love so strong that it dissolved away all the bitterness that had been caked around her heart.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She opened her eyes.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Are you all right, Miss Nogard?\" asked Stephen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All the children were very worried about her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Nogard smiled at Louis, who was still holding her. \"I\u0027m fine,\" she said, then took a couple of steps to steady herself. \"In fact, I think I\u0027m better than I\u0027ve been in a long time.\" She laughed, then hugged Stephen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You should feel very proud of your class,\" she told Mrs. Jewls. \"They are bright well behaved, and just a pleasure to teach.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We are?\" asked Maurecia.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Nogard fluffed Maurecia\u0027s hair. \"Yes, you are,\" she said.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Maurecia smiled up at her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I know,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"As I told my obstetrician-\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Your what?\" asked Joy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Obstetrician,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"That\u0027s the doctor who helped me have my baby. Then, once a baby is born, she gets a new doctor. That doctor is called a pediatrician. That\u0027s different from a podiatrist who is a doctor who takes care of people\u0027s feet.
