That had been my own choice, a choice I was beginning to regret….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 10\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJACQUELINE DONOVAN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI n an attempt to hide her nervousness, Jacqueline poured herself a second glass of chardonnay. After the first sip she stepped into the kitchen and brought out the hors d’oeuvre platter for their guests. Martha had put together crackers artfully swirled with herb-mixed cream cheese and decorated with tiny shrimp. Paul had phoned earlier in the week to ask if he and Tammie Lee could stop by the house on Wednesday evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’d spent the Mother’s Day weekend in Louisiana with Tammie Lee’s mother, who apparently wasn’t feeling well. Jacqueline had made a conscious decision not to take offense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the first time Paul had ever asked permission to visit the family home, and Jacqueline’s nerves had been badly frayed ever since his phone call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Relax,” Reese said, following her into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t have a good feeling about this,” Jacqueline murmured. She glanced at the clock on the microwave and realized it was a full ten minutes before her son and daughter-in-law were due to arrive. She cringed at the prospect of making small talk with Tammie Lee, and feared that Paul was about to announce he’d accepted a transfer to the New Orleans branch so Tammie Lee could be close to her family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Setting up an appointment to come over here isn’t like Paul.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was just being thoughtful.” Reese walked around the counter and sat on a stool. “Isn’t knitting supposed to soothe your nerves?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s another thing,” Jacqueline snapped. “I’m dropping out of that ridiculous class.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis head flew back at the vehemence of her declaration. “What’s gotten into you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have my reasons.” She didn’t like the look on Reese’s face—as if he was disappointed in her. But he wasn’t the one confronting that ill-mannered punk rocker or whatever those people called themselves these days. Alix, spelled A-L-I-X, resembled a gang member; the girl frightened her. “Why should you care what I do?” Jacqueline leaned against the counter across from her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You seemed excited about it last week,” he said blandly. It was obviously of no consequence to him. “I thought it was a conciliatory gesture on your part. I assumed you signed up for the classes to show Paul you’re planning to be a good grandmother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am determined to be a wonderful grandmother. For heaven’s sake, what chance does a child of Tammie Lee’s have? She’ll grow up learning how to pickle pigs’ feet.” She shivered at the very idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, Jacqueline…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, I blame you for this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Me?” Reese straightened and for a moment he seemed about to laugh outright. “You blame me for what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For the fact that I’m in this…this awful knitting class.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. “You’d better tell me what’s going on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s a young woman in the class. I can’t imagine why she’d ever want to learn to knit, but it’s not important. She’s vile, Reese. That’s the only word I can think of to describe her. Her hair is the most ludicrous shade of purple and she took an instant dislike to me when she learned that you’re responsible for what’s happening in the Blossom Street neighborhood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReese reached for his wine. “Most people there welcome the renovation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Alix lives in the apartment building at the end of the street.” As far as Jacqueline could see, it was a rat-infested dump. If it was slated for demolition, all the better. Alix and her kind would need to look elsewhere for low-rent housing. Girls like that weren’t wanted in an upscale neighborhood, which Blossom Street would soon become.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah,” Reese murmured and sipped his wine. “Now I understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s planned for the building?” Jacqueline asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That hasn’t been decided.” Reese gently swirled his wine against the sides of the goblet. “The city is talking to the owner. My idea was to completely remodel the place into condos, but it seems some advocates for low-income housing now have the mayor’s ear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s unfortunate. Those low-rent people will ruin the neighborhood. You might as well kiss all your hard work goodbye.” She hated to sound like a pessimist, but if Alix was any indication of the quality of person living in that building, then the entire street was at risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe you should give the knitting class another try,” Reese suggested, ignoring her outburst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe truth of it was that Jacqueline wanted to continue. She hadn’t found the class “awful” at all; that was an exaggeration for Reese’s benefit. Other than the confrontation with Alix, she’d enjoyed the lesson. At one point, Lydia had told them to walk around the shop and choose three balls of yarn in their favorite colors. At the time it’d seemed like a useless exercise. Jacqueline had chosen a silver gloss, a deep purple and a vibrant red. Lydia’s next instruction had been to choose wool in the color she disliked most. Jacqueline had gone immediately to a skein of bright yellow, which was the color that appealed to her least. Lydia had talked about contrasting colors and showed how they often complement each other. In fact, the yellow had looked completely different against the purple, and just as Lydia had said, the contrast was surprisingly effective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’d discovered that so much of knitting was about choosing the textures and colors, which was something she hadn’t considered before. Jacqueline had walked out of the class with the realization that she’d learn far more than the basic knitting stitches. That, however, did little to quell her uneasiness concerning Alix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I might decide to attend the second beginners’ session later in the summer,” Jacqueline muttered, still unsure of what to do. She’d paid for the entire six-week course and detested the thought of some hoodlum driving her away with intimidation and ill-manners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorbell rang and Jacqueline felt the tension crawl up her spine. While Reese answered the door, she forced a smile and moved into the formal living room, hands clasped in front of her. She waited for Reese to greet Paul and Tammie Lee in the foyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How wonderful to see you both,” Jacqueline purred, extending her arms to Tammie Lee and her son as they entered the room. She briefly hugged her daughter-in-law and grazed Paul’s cheek with her lips. Now that she knew Tammie Lee was pregnant, she wondered how she hadn’t guessed earlier. Her daughter-in-law was definitely showing—enough to be wearing a maternity top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul and Tammie Lee sat on the sofa, so close their shoulders touched. They held hands, as if to proclaim that nothing would tear them apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Reese poured a glass of wine for Paul, Jacqueline carried in the platter of hors d’oeuvres. Tammie Lee smiled up at Jacqueline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I just love shrimp and ever since I’ve been pregnant I’ve had the worst craving for them,” she said in a soft twang. “Just ask Paul. I think he must be thoroughly sick of shrimp, but he never complains.” She gazed lovingly toward her husband as she accepted a small napkin and two crackers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul cast his wife a look of love and pride, and it was all Jacqueline could do to maintain her composure. For the life of her, she couldn’t understand what her son saw in this girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What can I get you to drink?” Reese asked Tammie Lee when he brought Paul his wineglass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s so nice of you to ask, but I’m just fine, thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf there was anything for which to be grateful, Jacqueline mused, it was the fact that Tammie Lee seemed to be taking care of herself during the pregnancy. At least she had that much common sense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReese and Jacqueline sat across from them in leather chairs, with a polished mahogany end table between them. They so rarely used the formal living room that five years after she’d purchased the chairs they still smelled of new leather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think we should tell them,” Tammie Lee whispered to Paul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul nodded and squeezed her hand. “Tammie Lee had an ultrasound this afternoon and it seems we’re having a baby girl.” He smiled. “Sometimes they can’t be sure, but our technician was quite positive it’s a girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A girl,” Reese repeated and the happiness in his voice was unmistakable. He stood and clapped Paul on the back. “Did you hear that, Jacquie? We’re finally getting our baby girl!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacqueline felt her hands go numb. “A granddaughter,” she repeated as the odd tingling sensation spread up her arms. Oh, how she’d once longed for a daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We haven’t chosen any names yet,” Tammie Lee rushed to add in that soft drawl of hers. It always made her sound as if she was talking underwater. “We only decided this afternoon that we wanted to know the sex of the baby. You’re the first people we’ve told.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your mother and I had always hoped for a little girl,” Reese said, echoing Jacqueline’s thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s…wonderful,” Jacqueline finally managed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We decided we should let you know, Mom,” Paul said, directing his attention to her for the first time, “so you’d know what color yarn to get for the baby blanket.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mrs. Donovan, I declare, when Paul told me you were knitting a blanket for the baby, it just warmed my heart. Y’all have been so kind to me.” She planted both hands over her stomach and sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat twang of Tammie Lee’s put Jacqueline’s teeth on edge. Some might find it pleasing, but to Jacqueline it sounded uneducated. Unrefined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s more news,” Paul said, moving toward the edge of the sofa cushion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More?” Reese said. “Don’t tell me you’re having twins.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing like that.” Paul laughed shortly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTammie Lee grinned at her husband. “Twins! I’m so nervous about one baby, I can’t even imagine what would happen if we had two.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul turned to share such a gentle look with his wife that Jacqueline glanced away. Any hope she had of her son regretting his marriage died a quick death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So what’s your other news?” Reese asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul’s face brightened. “I got word last week that Tammie Lee and I have been accepted into the Seattle Country Club.” The club, to which Jacqueline and Reese belonged, was the most prestigious in the area. New memberships were limited to only a few each year. It went without saying that only the right kind of people were accepted. One of Jacqueline’s first thoughts when she was introduced to Tammie Lee was that Paul had ruined his chances of ever joining the country club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m so pleased,” Jacqueline said, doing her best to smile. Apparently Tammie Lee’s lengthy and inappropriate discussions of southern cuisine hadn’t been as much of a detriment as she’d assumed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been asked to work on the cookbook committee,” Tammie Lee gushed as if this was the greatest compliment of her life. “I can’t tell you the number of times someone’s asked me to share my mama’s, Aunt Thelma’s and Aunt Frieda’s favorite recipes.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-shop-on-blossom-street-blossom-street-1/page-11.html","bookId":1933,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:56:23 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:56:23 AM"}
