He did not speak, but there was no need for words. Nick knew exactly what he was thinking. I didn\u0027t do everything right along the way but by God, one thing you can count on, I\u0027d go to hell and back for you two, no questions asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick met Sullivan\u0027s eyes. I\u0027d do the same for you, he thought. No questions asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSullivan smiled slightly and Nick knew that he understood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe limo driver put two suitcases down on the porch and looked at Sullivan. \"Anything else, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thanks, Ben. We\u0027re all set for a few days. I\u0027ll give you a call when I need you. Take it easy on the way back to Portland.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen nodded. \"Will do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bye, Ben,\" Carson said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So long, pal. I\u0027ll look forward to meeting your dog when you finally get him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Carson said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen nodded to all of them and went back down the steps. He got behind the wheel of the big car, put it in gear, and drove off toward the main road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick ruffled Carson\u0027s hair. \"How was the trip?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We stopped along the way and I got ice cream and Great-Granddad and Ben got coffee and then we looked at some caves. Really big caves. Bigger than the ones we have in Dead Hand Cove,\" Carson reported with excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We stopped to stretch our legs,\" Sullivan said, coming up the steps, \"but we made good time.\" He raised his brows. \"Didn\u0027t want to risk being late for the art show.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarson looked at Nick. \"Has Miss Brightwell hung my picture yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I stopped by the gallery a couple of hours ago it was closed to the public, so I didn\u0027t go inside,\" Nick said. \"Octavia and Gail were very busy getting things ready for this evening. They\u0027re probably hanging your drawing of Winston as we speak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, boy.\" Carson whirled around and raced into the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSullivan stopped beside Nick. They watched the screen door swing shut behind Carson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Had a long talk with Mitch today when we set out from Portland,\" Sullivan said. \"We came up with a name for you. But we think we ought to go with you when you confront the person. If we\u0027re right, this goes all the way back to the days of Harte-Madison. Mitch and I feel some responsibility for the situation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That collateral damage you mentioned?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Afraid so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the name of your suspect?\" Nick asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSullivan told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That pretty well cinches it,\" Nick said. He picked up one of the suitcases. \"I came up with the same name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSullivan hoisted the other suitcase. \"No reason this can\u0027t wait until tomorrow, is there? When word gets out no one\u0027s going to be able to talk about anything else. Gonna be rough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If Octavia agrees, it can wait until tomorrow,\" Nick said. \"But no longer. I\u0027m sorry about what\u0027s going to come down when this becomes public knowledge, but I\u0027ve got Octavia to think about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSullivan nodded. \"And she comes first now, is that it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt six o\u0027clock that evening every parking lot was full. A large crowd of locals, Heralds, tourists, and summer people thronged the street and sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColorful balloons bobbed from the open doors of the shops and gallery. The temperature had been above average during the day, a balmy eighty-two, and the late summer sun was fending off the evening chill. The Annual Eclipse Bay Summer Celebration was in full swing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOctavia breathed a sigh of relief when several kids, dragging their parents, surged into Bright Visions the minute the door was opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looks like the show isn\u0027t going to be a disaster after all,\" she said in a low voice to Gail, who was supervising the punch-and-cookies table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGail chuckled. \"Told you not to worry. Did you really think anyone would stay away? Every kid with a picture in the show will be here tonight, and everyone else in town will come just to get a look at you and Nick together. After all, you\u0027re the lady who shattered the curse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then, of course, there is the fact that I am a noted local art thief,\" Octavia said dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, a little notoriety never hurts when it comes to publicity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just goes to prove the old publicity axiom, I guess. \u0027I don\u0027t care what you call me so long as you spell my name right\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGail\u0027s amusement faded. \"It\u0027s true that people are very curious about your relationship with Nick. And I won\u0027t say that the rumors about the missing Upsall haven\u0027t piqued everyone\u0027s interest. But the bottom line is that a lot of people really like you, Octavia. You\u0027re a nice person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOctavia made a face. \"You mean, for an art thief?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gail is right.\" Hannah appeared out of the crowd and helped herself to a chocolate chip cookie. \"You and the Bright Visions gallery are part of this town. Folks wouldn\u0027t be talking about you if you weren\u0027t considered a legitimate member of the community. Local folks never talk about outsiders. They\u0027re not interested in the summer people or the casual visitors.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like it or not, you belong here,\" Gail said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah glanced toward the door. \"And here come a couple of your biggest admirers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOctavia followed the direction of her gaze and saw Eugene and Dwayne enter the gallery. They looked different. It took her a few seconds to realize that both men had shaved and put on clean shirts and pants for the occasion. Eugene\u0027s hair was slicked down with some sort of shiny pomade, and Dwayne had tied his in a ponytail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pair came to a halt just inside the entrance, blocking traffic. Although they had walked into the gallery with a certain air of bravado, they now appeared uncomfortable. She got the feeling neither of them knew what to do next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you look at that,\" Gail murmured. \"They\u0027ve actually buttoned their shirts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sort of ruins the image when you can\u0027t see Eugene\u0027s hairy belly through the holes in his undershirt, doesn\u0027t it?\" Hannah mused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGail frowned. \"I hope they\u0027re not here to start trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" Hannah said. \"Sean Valentine is just outside talking to Nick and A.Z. and Virgil. Eugene and Dwayne won\u0027t create any problems with the chief nearby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I agree, there\u0027s no cause for alarm.\" Octavia picked up two paper cups filled with punch. \"They wouldn\u0027t have gone to all the effort to get cleaned up if they\u0027d planned to start another brawl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made her way through the crowd to where Eugene and Dwayne hovered uncertainly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello,\" she said brightly, handing a cup to each man. \"I\u0027m glad you could make it tonight. Please come in and have a look around.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-70.html","bookId":1793,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM"}
