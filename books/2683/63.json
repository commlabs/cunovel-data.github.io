The usual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is Elsa?\" she asks, still glaring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Elsa and I are both Capricorns so we get along very nicely,\" I say. \"Is it cold in here or is it just me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And otherwise?\" she asks, waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was, er, very, very-oh yeah-important\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Important?\" Lauren asks semi-dubiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clothes are important, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They eventually clean furniture, Victor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I exclaim. \"Lighten up, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victor, you\u0027ve got to get out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were you doing?\" I ask, moving around the room, taking the whole apartment in. \"Why weren\u0027t you at the show?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had a photo shoot promoting a terrible movie I\u0027m in with Ben Chaplin and Rufus Sewell,\" she hisses, barely able to contain herself. \"Then I took a bubble bath and read an article on the impossibility of real emotion on the Upper East Side in New York magazine.\" She stubs out the cigarette. \"This was a draining conversation, yet one I\u0027m glad we had. The door\u0027s over there in case you\u0027ve forgotten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walks past me, down a hallway covered with a Berber-style woven carpet and Moroccan embroidered pillows stacked against the walls and then I\u0027m in her bedroom, where I flop on the bed, leaning back on my elbows, my feet barely touching the floor, watching as Lauren stalks into the bathroom and begins toweling her hair dry. Behind her a poster for some indie film starring Steve Buscemi hangs above the toilet. She\u0027s so annoyed-but maybe in a fake way-that I have to say, \"Oh come off it, I\u0027m not so bad. I bet you hang out with guys who say things like \u0027But what if I want a new Maserati\u0027 all the time. I bet your life is filled with that.\" I stop, then add, \"Too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe picks up a half-empty glass of champagne by the sink, downs it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I say, pointing at the framed poster. \"You were in that movie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unfortunately,\" she mutters. \"Notice where it\u0027s hanging?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closes her eyes, touches her forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You just finished a new movie?\" I ask softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" Suddenly she searches through an array of Estee Lauder jars, Lancome products, picks up a L\u0027Occitane butter massage balm that Chloe also uses, reads the ingredients, puts it down, finally gives up and just looks at herself in the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s it about?\" I ask as if it matters. \"It\u0027s kind of like Footloose,\" she says, then pauses and delicately whispers, \"But set on Mars.\" She waits for my reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just stare at her from the bed. A longish silence. \"That\u0027s so cool, baby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wept on the set every day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you just break up with someone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You-are-a-dunce.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m waiting to see if I\u0027m getting a role in Flatliners II,\" I mention casually, stretching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we\u0027re in the same boat?\" she asks. \"Is that it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alison Poole told me you were doing pretty well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swigs from a nearby bottle of Evian. \"Let\u0027s just say it\u0027s been lucratively tedious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, I\u0027m sensing that you\u0027re a star.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you seen any of my movies?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePause. \"Alison Poole told me you were doing-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t mention that cunt\u0027s name in this apartment,\" she screams, throwing a brush at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey baby,\" I say, ducking. \"Come here, baby, chill out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" she asks, irritably. \"Come where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come here,\" I murmur, staring straight at her. \"Come here,\" I say, patting the comforter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe just stares at me lying on the bed, my shirt pulled up a little, showing off my lower abs, my legs slightly spread.
