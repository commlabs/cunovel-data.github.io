He glanced toward the far end of the room, where the Willis brothers were busy with a tape measure and a clipboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe brothers were fixtures in town. For as long as Nick could remember, they had worked as general contractors, doing everything from plumbing to roof repairs. They were identical twins, but no one in town had any trouble telling them apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom his cleanly shaved skull to his crisply laundered overalls, Walter Willis was as precise and polished as one of the gleaming tools he wore on his belt. Torrance, on the other hand, wore his thin, straggling hair in a greasy ponytail. His work clothes were stained with everything from paint splatters to pizza sauce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What color are you going to paint the place?\" Jeremy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred pursed his lips. \"I\u0027m thinking taupe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Taupe?\" Jeremy stared at him. \"You\u0027re kidding, right? Taupe isn\u0027t the color you use for a bar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What color is taupe, anyway?\" Nick asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who knows?\" Fred said. \"Walt over there suggested it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget taupe,\" Jeremy advised. \"I\u0027d go with dark green and maybe a warm brown on the baseboards and trim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to him,\" Nick said. \"The man\u0027s an artist.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Green and brown, huh?\" Fred pondered that for a while. \"Walt said he\u0027d give me a special on the taupe. Said he had some left over from a job he and Torrance did for one of the summer people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t suppose it much matters what color you use,\" Nick said. \"No one will be able to see it in here, anyway, what with the low lighting and all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred scowled. \"Gotta keep the lights low.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Jeremy asked. \"So folks won\u0027t notice the size of the roaches?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gives the place ambience,\" Fred said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened. For a few seconds the glare of daylight silhouetted the distinctive figures of Eugene and Dwayne. Then the door closed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t think you need a lot of ambience to attract those two,\" Nick said. \"Just spray a little stale beer around the place and sprinkle some aged French fries under the tables.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEugene came to a halt halfway across the room and staggered a bit, feigning astonishment. \"Well, as I live and breathe, Dwayne, if it ain\u0027t our good buddies, Harte and Seaton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwayne, who had been tailgating his companion, collided with Eugene\u0027s backside and ricocheted off a couple of feet. He regained his balance and peered at Nick and Jeremy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah,\" Dwayne said. \"It\u0027s them, all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dwayne and me was just over at the station talkin\u0027 to Sandy,\" Eugene explained. He lumbered into gear again, making his way through the maze of empty tables. \"Saw you guys come in here. We want to buy you a drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy straightened warily. \"Much as we\u0027d love to stay and chat, Nick and I have appointments today. Isn\u0027t that right, Nick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick did not take his eyes off Eugene. \"You want to buy us a drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. After all that fun we had together, it only seems fair.\" Eugene reached the end of the bar and gestured expansively. \"Beers all around, Fred.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred shrugged and set out four glasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gee, Eugene,\" Jeremy muttered. \"We don\u0027t know what to say, do we, Nick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Speechless,\" Nick agreed dryly. \"What\u0027s this all about, Eugene?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, me and Dwayne figure we owe you two something for covering the damages Fred, here, claims he\u0027s owed for the other night. Ain\u0027t that right, Dwayne?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\" Dwayne perched on the stool next to Eugene. \"Mighty generous of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred put a full glass down in front of everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEugene hoisted his glass. \"Here\u0027s to good times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good times.\" Nick picked up his glass and drank some beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremy hesitated and then followed suit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEugene beamed. \"Never thought I\u0027d see you in a bar fight, Harte. Or you, either, for that matter, Seaton. Who\u0027d have believed that you two would turn out to be just a couple of regular guys, after all? You ever believe that, Fred?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonders never cease.\" Fred walked out from behind the bar. \"I\u0027m gonna go talk to Walt and Torrance. I kinda like the idea of green and brown on the walls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEugene waited until he had moved off into the pool room where the Willis brothers were now working. Then he looked down the bar at Nick and Jeremy. He stopped smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, Dwayne and me, we never thanked you two for getting us out of the car that night we went into the water,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget it,\" Nick said. \"That was a long time ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" Eugene took a long pull on his beer. \"A long time ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one said anything for a while. Eugene and Dwayne worked steadily on their beers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After it happened,\" Eugene said eventually, \"we figured you\u0027d go straight to Chief Yates, you know? Maybe tell him about that little game of chicken we were all playing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean, tell him how you tried to run us off the road?\" Jeremy asked neutrally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe things got a little outta hand,\" Eugene said. \"Me and Dwayne were really pissed after you showed us up at the races that night. If you\u0027d gone to Yates and told him your version of events, he\u0027d have believed you on accounta you and Harte, here, come from such fine, upstanding families and all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to belabor the issue,\" Jeremy said, \"but our version of events would have been the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were just foolin\u0027 around,\" Eugene insisted. \"Like I said, things got outta hand. But that ain\u0027t the point. Point is, Yates and everybody else would have believed you guys. Nobody would have even listened to our side of the story on accounta everyone around here figures me and Dwayne for trash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick glanced at Jeremy. Eugene was right and they both knew it. Nobody in Eclipse Bay would have taken Eugene\u0027s or Dwayne\u0027s word over the word of a Harte or a Seaton, regardless of the circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEugene looked at Nick. \"The other night, I\u0027d had a few beers. I maybe said some things about your girlfriend that I shouldn\u0027t have said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick inclined his head. \"True.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, that Miss Brightwell always says something nice when she sees us on the street,\" Eugene continued. \"Ain\u0027t that right, Dwayne?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/summer-in-eclipse-bay-eclipse-bay-3/page-67.html","bookId":1793,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:46 PM"}
