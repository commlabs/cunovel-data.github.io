Mr. Daugherty gave it to me at school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul pulled the book out of his pocket and pried at it till he had its plastic jacket off. He unreeled the tape a bit, ran it through the vocalizer, which he turned down to a whisper, then placed it within the Bard\u0027s vitals. He made further attachments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027ll that do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The book will talk and the Bard will put it all on its memory tape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What good will that do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boy, you\u0027re a dope! This book is all about computers and automation and the Bard will get all that information. Then he can stop talking about kings making lightning when they frown.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNiccolo said, \"And the good guy always wins anyway. There\u0027s no excitement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, well,\" said Paul, watching to see if his setup was working properly, \"that\u0027s the way they make Bards. They got to have the good guy win and make the bad guys lose and things like that. I heard my father talking about it once. He says that without censorship there\u0027d be no telling what the younger generation would come to. He says it\u0027s bad enough as it is... There, it\u0027s working fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul brushed his hands against one another and turned away from the Bard. He said, \"But listen, I didn\u0027t tell you my idea yet. It\u0027s the best thing you ever heard, I bet. I came right to you, because I figured you\u0027d come in with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, Paul, sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. You know Mr. Daugherty at school? You know what a funny kind of guy he is. Well, he likes me, kind of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was over at his house after school today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. He says I\u0027m going to be entering computer school and he wants to encourage me and things like that. He says the world needs more people who can design advanced computer circuits and do proper programing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul might have caught some of the emptiness behind that monosyllable. He said impatiently, \"Programing! I told you a hundred times. That\u0027s when you set up problems for the giant computers like Multivac to work on. Mr. Daugherty says it gets harder all the time to find people who can really run computers. He says anyone can keep an eye on the controls and check off answers and put through routine problems. He says the trick is to expand research and figure out ways to ask the right questions, and that\u0027s hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway, Nickie, he took me to his place and showed me his collection of old computers. It\u0027s kind of a hobby of his to collect old computers. He had tiny computers you had to push with your hand, with little knobs all over it. And he had a hunk of wood he called a slide rule with a little piece of it that went in and out. And some wires with balls on them. He even had a hunk of paper with a kind of thing he called a multiplication table.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNiccolo, who found himself only moderately interested, said, \"A paper table?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t really a table like you eat on. It was different. It was to help people compute. Mr. Daugherty tried to explain but he didn\u0027t have much time and it was kind of complicated, anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t people just use a computer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was before they had computers,\" cried Paul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. Do you think people always had computers? Didn\u0027t you ever hear of cavemen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNiccolo said, \"How\u0027d they get along without computers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Mr. Daugherty says they just had children any old time and did anything that came into their heads whether it would be good for everybody or not. They didn\u0027t even know if it was good or not. And farmers grew things with their hands and people had to do all the work in the factories and run all the machines.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what Mr. Daugherty said. He said it was just plain messy and everyone was miserable... Anyway, let me get to my idea, will you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, go ahead. Who\u0027s stopping you?\" said Niccolo, offended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. Well, the hand computers, the ones with the knobs, had little squiggles on each knob. And the slide rule had squiggles on it. And the multiplication table was all squiggles. I asked what they were. Mr. Daugherty said they were numbers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Each different squiggle stood for a different number. For \u0027one\u0027 you made a kind of mark, for \u0027two\u0027 you make another kind of mark, for \u0027three\u0027 another one and so on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you could compute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What for? You just tell the computer-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jiminy,\" cried Paul, his face twisting with anger, \"can\u0027t you get it through your head? These slide rules and things didn\u0027t talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then how-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The answers showed up in squiggles and you had to know what the squiggles meant. Mr. Daugherty says that, in olden days, everybody learned how to make squiggles when they were kids and how to decode them, too. Making squiggles was called \u0027writing\u0027 and decoding them was \u0027reading.\u0027 He says there was a different kind of squiggle for every word and they used to write whole books in squiggles. He said they had some at the museum and I could look at them if I wanted to. He said if I was going to be a real computer and programer I would have to know about the history of computing and that\u0027s why he was showing me all these things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNiccolo frowned. He said, \"You mean everybody had to figure out squiggles for every word and remember them?... Is this all real or are you making it up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all real. Honest. Look, this is the way you make a \u0027one.\u0027 \" He drew his finger through the air in a rapid downstroke. \"This way you make \u0027two,\u0027 and this way \u0027three.\u0027 I learned all the numbers up to \u0027nine.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNiccolo watched the curving finger uncomprehendingly. \"What\u0027s the good of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can learn how to make words. I asked Mr. Daugherty how you made the squiggle for \u0027Paul Loeb\u0027 but he didn\u0027t know. He said there were people at the museum who would know. He said there were people who had learned how to decode whole books. He said computers could be designed to decode books and used to be used that way but not any more because we have real books now, with magnetic tapes that go through the vocalizer and come out talking, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So if we go down to the museum, we can get to learn how to make words in squiggles. They\u0027ll let us because I\u0027m going to computer school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNiccolo was riddled with disappointment. \"Is that your idea? Holy Smokes, Paul, who wants to do that? Make stupid squiggles!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you get it? Don\u0027t you get it? You dope. It\u0027ll be secret message stuff!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. What good is talking when everyone can understand you? With squiggles you can send secret messages. You can make them on paper and nobody in the world would know what you were saying unless they knew the squiggles, too. And they wouldn\u0027t, you bet, unless we taught them. We can have a real club, with initiations and rules and a clubhouse. Boy-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA certain excitement began stirring in Niccolo\u0027s bosom. \"What kind of secret messages?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any kind. Say I want to tell you to come over my place and watch my new Visual Bard and I don\u0027t want any of the other fellows to come. I make the right squiggles on paper and I give it to you and you look at it and you know what to do. Nobody else does. You can even show it to them and they wouldn\u0027t know a thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, that\u0027s something,\" yelled Niccolo, completely won over. \"When do we learn how?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tomorrow,\" said Paul. \"I\u0027ll get Mr. Daugherty to explain to the museum that it\u0027s all right and you get your mother and father to say okay. We can go down right after school and start learning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure!\" cried Niccolo. \"We can be club officers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be president of the club,\" said Paul matter-of-factly. \"You can be vice-president.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. Hey, this is going to be tots more fun than the Bard.\" He was suddenly reminded of the Bard and said in sudden apprehension, \"Hey, what about my old Bard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul turned to look at it. It was quietly taking in the slowly unreeling book, and the sound of the book\u0027s vocalizations was a dimly heard murmur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"I\u0027ll disconnect it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe worked away while Niccolo watched anxiously. After a few moments, Paul put his reassembled book into his pocket, replaced the Bard\u0027s panel and activated it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bard said, \"Once upon a time, in a large city, there lived a poor young boy named Fair Johnnie whose only friend in the world was a small computer. The computer, each morning, would tell the boy whether it would rain that day and answer any problems he might have. It was never wrong. But it so happened that one day, the king of that land, having heard of the little computer, decided that he would have it as his own. With this purpose in mind, he called in his Grand Vizier and said-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNiccolo turned off the Bard with a quick motion of his hand. \"Same old junk,\" he said passionately, \"just with a computer thrown in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" said Paul, \"they got so much stuff on the tape already that the computer business doesn\u0027t show up much when random combinations are made. What\u0027s the difference, anyway? You just need a new model.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll never be able to afford one. Just this dirty old miserable thing.\" He kicked at it again, hitting it more squarely this time. The Bard moved backward with a squeal of castors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can always watch mine, when I get it,\" said Paul. \"Besides, don\u0027t forget our squiggle club.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNiccolo nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tell you what,\" said Paul. \"Let\u0027s go over to my place. My father has some books about old times. We can listen to them and maybe get some ideas. You leave a note for your folks and maybe you can stay over for supper. Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" said Niccolo, and the two boys ran out together. Niccolo, in his eagerness, ran almost squarely into the Bard, but he only rubbed at the spot on his hip where he had made contact and ran on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe activation signal of the Bard glowed. Niccolo\u0027s collision closed a circuit and, although it was alone in the room and there was none to hear, it began a story, nevertheless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not in its usual voice, somehow; in a lower tone that had a hint of throatiness in it. An adult, listening, might almost have thought that the voice carried a hint of passion in it, a trace of near feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bard said: \"Once upon a time, there was a little computer named the Bard who lived all alone with cruel step-people. The cruel step-people continually made fun of the little computer and sneered at him, telling him he was good-for-nothing and that he was a useless object. They struck him and kept him in lonely rooms for months at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yet through it all the little computer remained brave. He always did the best he could, obeying all orders cheerfully. Nevertheless, the step-people with whom he lived remained cruel and heartless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One day, the little computer learned that in the world there existed a great many computers of all sorts, great numbers of them. Some were Bards like himself, but some ran factories, and some ran farms. Some organized population and some analyzed all kinds of data. Many were very powerful and very wise, much more powerful and wise than the step-people who were so cruel to the little computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the little computer knew then that computers would always grow wiser and more powerful until someday-someday-someday-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut a valve must finally have stuck in the Bard\u0027s aging and corroding vitals, for as it waited alone in the darkening room through the evening, it could only whisper over and over again, \"Someday-someday-someday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Author\u0027s Ordeal\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(with apologies to W.
