So, every time you use it— Aack! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalam had his hands round the wizard’s throat. He dragged his friend close. ‘Hedge was right about you,’ he whispered, as Quick Ben’s eyes bulged and his face darkened. ‘You’re insane, and worse, you think it’s funny!’ Feeble hands clawed at Kalam’s wrists. Snarling, the assassin flung Quick Ben away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaggering, the wizard fell to his knees, coughing, gasping to draw breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree soldiers came running up, but Kalam held out a hand to halt them. ‘Return to your ranks. He’ll live, and if I kick him while he’s down, it’ll only be once or twice.’ Seeing the look in their eyes, the assassin snorted. ‘Aye, he’s the High Mage. My point exactly. Now,’ his expression hardened, ‘ get lost .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldiers retreated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalam turned to glare at Quick Ben. ‘Hedge always kept a sharper back, you know. Had your face painted on it. He used to tell us, if you went and killed him with one of your schemes, with his last act he was going to wing it at the back of your head. You know, I used to think that was a bit extreme.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving the gagging man on his hands and knees, Kalam resumed his walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy brother could not have planned for this. To see so much of his work … unravelled. He understood the necessity of balance, but he also understood the wonder that is life itself. No, he could not have meant this to happen . Silchas Ruin glanced over to where Tulas Shorn stood on the bluff’s edge. Escape from death is never the escape you think it is . ‘Would we have done it?’ he called over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe undead warrior’s head turned, tilted slightly. ‘We were young. Anything was possible.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then … one of us would have knelt before the body of the other, weeping.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘That is likely.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But now … Tulas, it seems we shall fight side by side, and there will be none to kneel by our bodies, none to weep for us.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘My Hounds are wandering – I can feel them. Hunting interlopers, dreaming of the chase. They wander the broken fragments of Kurald Emurlahn.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas Ruin was silent, wondering where his friend’s thoughts were taking him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTulas Shorn sighed, the breath a long, dry rattle. ‘Do you know what I envy most about my Hounds? Their freedom. Nothing complicated in their lives. No … difficult choices.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNodding, Silchas looked away. ‘We face one now, don’t we?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The Eleint will be driven to frenzy. Their entire being will be consumed with the need to kill Korabas – can you not feel it in your own blood, Silchas?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTulas continued, ‘We are left to a matter of faith. I doubt even Anomander could have anticipated that the Elder Gods would be so desperate, so vengeful.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And this is what is troubling me,’ Silchas Ruin admitted. ‘We cannot assume that all the Elder Gods acceded to the unchaining of the Otataral Dragon.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Does it matter?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I’m not sure.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTulas Shorn walked back from the edge. ‘Will any of them regret the annihilation of the gods? I doubt it. Once their children are gone, their resurrection is assured.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘To inherit what, Tulas?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ah, yes, but they do expect the Eleint to kill Korabas. They require it, in fact.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Must we satisfy them?’ Silchas asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTulas Shorn was silent for a while, and his face taken into death could give no expression, and the eyes were closed doors. ‘My friend, what choice have we? If Korabas survives, this realm will die, and it will be the first of many.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Leaving in its wake a land without magic. But even in such places life will return.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We cannot be certain of that. For all that we have explored the secrets of sorcery, we still know so little. We have flown over lifeless flesh – we have seen what happens when everything is truly stripped away.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas Ruin studied his friend for a moment, then lowered himself into a squat and stared out over the valley to the south. ‘Am I fooling myself?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘About what?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas started, unaware that he had spoken out loud. ‘My brother knew well the Elder Gods. He’d clashed with them often enough.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It may be that his answer to the threat posed by the Elder Gods was to free Draconus.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDraconus . ‘Then what will Draconus do?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I do not know, but even thinking about it fills me with fear. We know well what comes when Draconus is awakened to true anger – his solution may prove worse than the problem. Abyss knows, friend, we have seen that for ourselves. Still, since you have asked, I will give the matter some thought. Draconus … freed. Who can oppose him, now that your brother is dead? I don’t know – this world has moved on. What would he do first? He would hunt down and kill the ones who freed Korabas. He always took retribution seriously.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-343.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
