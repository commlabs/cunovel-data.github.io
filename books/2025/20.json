I must have fallen asleep on the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I woke up, I was in my bed and the dull light coming through my windows slanted in from a strange angle. Almost like it was afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI yawned and stretched, my fingers searching for him and coming up empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward?\" I mumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy seeking fingers encountered something cool and smooth. His hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you really awake this time?\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mmm,\" I sighed in assent. \"Have there been a lot of false alarms?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been very restless - talking all day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allday?\" I blinked and looked at the windows again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had a long night,\" he said reassuringly. \"You\u0027d earned a day in bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat up, and my head spun. The light was coming in my window from the west. \"Wow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hungry?\" he guessed. \"Do you want breakfast in bed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get it,\" I groaned, stretching again. \"I need to get up and move around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held my hand on the way to the kitchen, eyeing me carefully, like I might fall over. Or maybe he thought I was sleepwalking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept it simple, throwing a couple of Pop-Tarts in the toaster. I caught a glimpse of myself in the reflective chrome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ugh, I\u0027m a mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a long night,\" he said again. \"You should have stayed here and slept.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right! And missed everything. You know, you need to start accepting the fact that I\u0027m part of the family now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. \"I could probably get used to that idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat down with my breakfast, and he sat next to me. When I lifted the Pop-Tart to take the first bite, I noticed him staring at my hand. I looked down, and saw that I was still wearing the gift that Jacob had given me at the party.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I?\" he asked, reaching for the tiny wooden wolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed noisily. \"Um, sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved his hand under the charm bracelet and balanced the little figurine in his snowy palm. For a fleeting moment, I was afraid. Just the slightest twist of his fingers could crush it into splinters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut of course Edward wouldn\u0027t do that. I was embarrassed I\u0027d even had the thought. He only weighed the wolf in his palm for a moment, and then let it fall. It swung lightly from my wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to read the expression in his eyes. All I could see was thoughtfulness; he kept everything else hidden, if there was anything else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jacob Black can give you presents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t a question, or an accusation. Just a statement of fact. But I knew he was referring to my last birthday and the fit I\u0027d thrown over gifts; I hadn\u0027t wanted any. Especially not from Edward. It wasn\u0027t entirely logical, and, of course, everyone had ignored me anyway. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve given me presents,\" I reminded him. \"You know I like the homemade kind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pursed his lips for a second. \"How about hand-me-downs? Are those acceptable?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This bracelet.\" His finger traced a circle around my wrist. \"You\u0027ll be wearing this a lot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you wouldn\u0027t want to hurt his feelings,\" he suggested shrewdly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, I guess so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you think it\u0027s fair, then,\" he asked, looking down at my hand as he spoke. He turned it palm up, and ran his finger along the veins in my wrist. \"If I have a little representation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Representation?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A charm - something to keep me on your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re in every thought I have. I don\u0027t need reminders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I gave you something, would you wear it?\" he pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A hand-me-down?\" I checked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, something I\u0027ve had for a while.\" He smiled his angel\u0027s smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this was the only reaction to Jacob\u0027s gift, I would take it gladly. \"Whatever makes you happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you noticed the inequality?\" he asked, and his voice turned accusing. \"Because I certainly have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What inequality?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrowed. \"Everyone else is able to get away with giving you things. Everyone but me. I would have loved to get you a graduation present, but I didn\u0027t. I knew it would have upset you more than if anyone else did. That\u0027s utterly unfair. How do you explain yourself?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Easy.\" I shrugged. \"You\u0027re more important than everyone else. And you\u0027ve given me you. That\u0027s already more than I deserve, and anything else you give me just throws us more out of balance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe processed that for a moment, and then rolled his eyes. \"The way you regard me is ludicrous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI chewed my breakfast calmly. I knew he wouldn\u0027t listen if I told him that he had that backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward\u0027s phone buzzed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at the number before he opened it. \"What is it, Alice?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe listened, and I waited for his reaction, suddenly nervous. But whatever she said didn\u0027t surprise him. He sighed a few times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sort of guessed as much,\" he told her, staring into my eyes, a disapproving arch to his brow. \"She was talking in her sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flushed. What had I said now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take care of it,\" he promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glared at me as he shut his phone. \"Is there something you\u0027d like to talk to me about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI deliberated for a moment. Given Alice\u0027s warning last night, I could guess why she\u0027d called. And then remembering the troubled dreams I\u0027d had as I\u0027d slept through the day - dreams where I chased after Jasper, trying to followhim and find the clearing in the maze-like woods, knowing I would find Edward there . . . Edward, and the monsters who wanted to kill me, but not caring about them because I\u0027d already made my decision - I could also guess what Edward had overheard while I\u0027d slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pursed my lips for a moment, not quite able to meet his gaze. He waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like Jasper\u0027s idea,\" I finally said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe groaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to help. I have to do something,\" I insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wouldn\u0027t help to have you in danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jasper thinks it would. This is his area of expertise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward glowered at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t keep me away,\" I threatened. \"I\u0027m not going to hide out in the forest while you all take risks for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, he was fighting a smile. \"Alice doesn\u0027t see you in the clearing, Bella. She sees you stumbling around lost in the woods. You won\u0027t be able to find us; you\u0027ll just make it more time consuming for me to find you afterward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to keep as cool as he was. \"That\u0027s because Alice didn\u0027t factor in Seth Clearwater,\" I said politely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If she had, of course, she wouldn\u0027t have been able to see anything at all. But it sounds like Seth wants to be there as much as I do. It shouldn\u0027t be too hard to persuade him to show me the way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger flickered across his face, and then he took a deep breath and composed himself. \"That might have worked . . . if you hadn\u0027t told me. Now I\u0027ll just ask Sam to give Seth certain orders. Much as he might want to, Seth won\u0027t be able to ignore that kind of injunction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI kept my smile pleasant. \"But why would Sam give those orders? If I tell him how it would help for me to be there? I\u0027ll bet Sam would rather do me a favor than you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to compose himself again. \"Maybe you\u0027re right. But I\u0027m sure Jacob would be only too eager to give those same orders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. \"Jacob?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jacob is second in command. Did he never tell you that? His orders have to be followed, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had me, and by his smile, he knew it. My forehead crumpled. Jacob would be on his side - in this one instance - I was sure. And Jacob never had told me that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward took advantage of the fact that I was momentarily stumped, continuing in a suspiciously smooth and soothing voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got a fascinating look into the pack\u0027s mind last night. It was better than a soap opera. I had no idea how complex the dynamic is with such a large pack. The pull of the individual against the plural psyche . . . Absolutely fascinating.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was obviously trying to distract me. I glared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jacob\u0027s been keeping a lot of secrets,\" he said with a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t answer, I just kept glaring, holding on to my argument and waiting for an opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For instance, did you note the smaller gray wolf there last night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded one stiff nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe chuckled. \"They take all of their legends so seriously. It turns out there are things that none of their stories prepared them for.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"Okay, I\u0027ll bite. What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They always accepted without question that it was only the direct grandsons of the original wolf who had the power to transform.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So someone changed who wasn\u0027t a direct descendant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. She\u0027s a direct descendant, all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked, and my eyes widened. \"She?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"She knows you. Her name is Leah Clearwater.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leah\u0027s a werewolf!\" I shrieked. \"What? For how long? Why didn\u0027t Jacob tell me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are things he wasn\u0027t allowed to share - their numbers, for instance. Like I said before, when Sam gives an order, the pack simply isn\u0027t able to ignore it. Jacob was very careful to think of other things when he was near me. Of course, after last night that\u0027s all out the window.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe it. Leah Clearwater!\" Suddenly, I remembered Jacob speaking of Leah and Sam, and the way he acted as if he\u0027d said too much - after he\u0027d said something about Sam having to look in Leah\u0027s eyes every day and know that he\u0027d broken all his promises. . . . Leah on the cliff, a tear glistening on her cheek when Old Quil had spoken of the burden and sacrifice the Quileute sons shared. . . . And Billy, spending time with Sue because she was having trouble with her kids . . . and here the trouble actually was that both of them were werewolves now!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hadn\u0027t given much thought to Leah Clearwater, just to grieve for her loss when Harry had passed away, and then to pity her again when Jacob had told her story, about how the strange imprinting between Sam and her cousin Emily had broken Leah\u0027s heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now she was part of Sam\u0027s pack, hearing his thoughts . . . and unable to hide her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really hate that part, Jacob had said. Everything you\u0027re ashamed of, laid out for everyone to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poor Leah,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward snorted. \"She\u0027s making life exceedingly unpleasant for the rest of them. I\u0027m not sure she deserves your sympathy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s hard enough for them, having to share all their thoughts. Most of them try to cooperate, make it easier. When even one member is deliberately malicious, it\u0027s painful for everyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She has reason enough,\" I mumbled, still on her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I know,\" he said. \"The imprinting compulsion is one of the strangest things I\u0027ve ever witnessed in my life, and I\u0027ve seen some strange things.\" He shook his head wonderingly. \"The way Sam is tied to his Emily is impossible to describe - or I should say her Sam. Sam really had no choice. It reminds me of A Midsummer Night\u0027s Dream with all the chaos caused by the fairies\u0027 love spells . . . like magic.\" He smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s very nearly as strong as the way I feel about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Poor Leah,\" I said again. \"But what do you mean, malicious?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s constantly bringing up things they\u0027d rather not think of,\" he explained. \"For example, Embry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s with Embry?\" I asked, surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His mother moved down from the Makah reservation seventeen years ago, when she was pregnant with him. She\u0027s not Quileute. Everyone assumed she\u0027d left his father behind with the Makahs. But then he joined the pack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So the prime candidates for his father are Quil Ateara Sr., Joshua Uley, or Billy Black, all of them married at that point, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" I gasped. Edward was right - this was exactly like a soap opera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now Sam, Jacob, and Quil all wonder which of them has a half-brother. They\u0027d all like to think it\u0027s Sam, since his father was never much of a father. But the doubt is always there. Jacob\u0027s never been able to ask Billy about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow. How did you get so much in one night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The pack mind is mesmerizing. All thinking together and then separately at the same time. There\u0027s so much to read!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sounded faintly regretful, like someone who\u0027d had to put down a good book just before the climax. I laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The pack is fascinating,\" I agreed. \"Almost as fascinating as you are when you\u0027re trying to distract me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis expression became polite again - a perfect poker face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to be in that clearing, Edward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" he said in a very final tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA certain path occurred to me at that moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t so much that I had to be in the clearing. I just had to be where Edward was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCruel, I accused myself. Selfish, selfish, selfish! Don\u0027t do it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignored my better instincts. I couldn\u0027t look at him while I spoke, though. The guilt had my eyes glued to the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, look, Edward,\" I whispered. \"Here\u0027s the thing . . . I\u0027ve already gone crazy once. I know what my limits are. And I can\u0027t stand it if you leave me again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t look up to see his reaction, afraid to know how much pain I was inflicting. I did hear his sudden intake of breath and the silence that followed. I stared at the dark wooden tabletop, wishing I could take the words back. But knowing I probably wouldn\u0027t. Not if it worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, his arms were around me, his hands stroking my face, my arms. He was comforting me. The guilt went into spiral mode. But the survival instinct was stronger. There was no question that he was fundamental to my survival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know it\u0027s not like that, Bella,\" he murmured. \"I won\u0027t be far, and it will be over quickly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t stand it,\" I insisted, still staring down. \"Not knowing whether or not you\u0027ll come back. How do I live through that, no matter how quickly it\u0027s over?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. \"It\u0027s going to be easy, Bella. There\u0027s no reason for your fears.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None at all?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And everybody will be fine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone,\" he promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So there\u0027s no way at all that I need to be in the clearing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not. Alice just told me that they\u0027re down to nineteen. We\u0027ll be able to handle it easily.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right - you said it was so easy that someone could sit out,\" I repeated his words from last night. \"Did you really mean that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt too simple - he had to see it coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So easy that you could sit out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a long moment of silence, I finally looked up at his expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe poker face was back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath. \"So it\u0027s one way or the other. Either there is more danger than you want me to know about, in which case it would be right for me to be there, to do what I can to help. Or . . . it\u0027s going to be so easy that they\u0027ll get by without you. Which way is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew what he was thinking of - the same thing I was thinking of. Carlisle. Esme. Emmett. Rosalie. Jasper. And . . . I forced myself to think the last name. And Alice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered if I was a monster. Not the kind that he thought he was, but the real kind. The kind that hurt people. The kind that had no limits when it came to what they wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I wanted was to keep him safe, safe with me. Did I have a limit to what I would do, what I would sacrifice for that? I wasn\u0027t sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You ask me to let them fight without my help?\" he said in a quiet voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" I was surprised I could keep my voice even, I felt so wretched inside. \"Or to let me be there. Either way, so long as we\u0027re together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath, and then exhaled slowly. He moved his hands to place them on either side of my face, forcing me to meet his gaze. He looked into my eyes for a long time. I wondered what he was looking for, and what it was that he found. Was the guilt as thick on my face as it was in my stomach - sickening me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes tightened against some emotion I couldn\u0027t read, and he dropped one hand to pull out his phone again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alice,\" he sighed. \"Could you come babysit Bella for a bit?\" He raised one eyebrow, daring me to object to the word. \"I need to speak with Jasper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe evidently agreed. He put the phone away and went back to staring at my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you going to say to Jasper?\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to discuss . . . me sitting out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was easy to read in his face how difficult the words were for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was sorry. I hated to make him do this. Not enough that I could fake a smile and tell him to go on ahead without me. Definitely not that much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t apologize,\" he said, smiling just a little. \"Never be afraid to tell me how you feel, Bella. If this is what you need . . .\" He shrugged. \"You are my first priority.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t mean it that way - like you have to choose me over your family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that. Besides, that\u0027s not what you asked. You gave me two alternatives that you could live with, and I chose the one that I could live with. That\u0027s how compromise is supposed to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leaned forward and rested my forehead against his chest. \"Thank you,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anytime,\" he answered, kissing my hair. \"Anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn\u0027t move for a long moment. I kept my face hidden, pressed against his shirt. Two voices struggled inside me. One that wanted to be good and brave, and one that told the good one to keep her mouth shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s the third wife?\" he asked me suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\" I said, stalling. I didn\u0027t remember having had that dream again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were mumbling something about \u0027the third wife\u0027 last night. The rest made a little sense, but you lost me there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Um, yeah. That was just one of the stories that I heard at the bonfire the other night.\" I shrugged. \"I guess it stuck with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward leaned away from me and cocked his head to the side, probably confused by the uncomfortable edge to my voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he could ask, Alice appeared in the kitchen doorway with a sour expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re going to miss all the fun,\" she grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Alice,\" he greeted her. He put one finger under my chin and tilted my face up to kiss me goodbye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll be back later tonight,\" he promised me. \"I\u0027ll go work this out with the others, rearrange things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s not much to arrange,\" Alice said. \"I already told them. Emmett is pleased.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward sighed. \"Of course he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked out the door, leaving me to face Alice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glared at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry,\" I apologized again. \"Do you think this will make it more dangerous for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snorted. \"You worry too much, Bella. You\u0027re going to go prematurely gray.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you upset, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward is such a grouch when he doesn\u0027t get his way. I\u0027m just anticipating living with him for the next few months.\" She made a face. \"I suppose, if it keeps you sane, it\u0027s worth it. But I wish you could control the pessimism, Bella. It\u0027s so unnecessary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you let Jasper go without you?\" I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice grimaced. \"That\u0027s different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go clean yourself up,\" she ordered me. \"Charlie will be home in fifteen minutes, and if you look this ragged he\u0027s not going to want to let you out again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow, I\u0027d really lost the whole day. It felt like such a waste. I was glad I wouldn\u0027t always have to squander my time with sleeping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was entirely presentable when Charlie got home - fully dressed, hair decent, and in the kitchen putting his dinner on the table. Alice sat in Edward\u0027s usual place, and this seemed to make Charlie\u0027s day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Howdy, Alice! How are you, hon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine, Charlie, thanks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see you finally made it out of bed, sleepyhead,\" he said to me as I sat beside him, before turning back to Alice. \"Everyone\u0027s talking about that party your parents threw last night. I\u0027ll bet you\u0027ve got one heck of a clean-up job ahead of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice shrugged. Knowing her, it was already done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was worth it,\" she said. \"It was a great party.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Edward?\" Charlie asked, a little grudgingly. \"Is he helping clean up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice sighed and her face turned tragic. It was probably an act, but it was too perfect for me to be positive. \"No. He\u0027s off planning the weekend with Emmett and Carlisle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hikingagain?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice nodded, her face suddenly forlorn. \"Yes. They\u0027re all going, except me. We always go backpacking at the end of the school year, sort of a celebration, but this year I decided I\u0027d rather shop than hike, and not one of them will stay behind with me. I\u0027m abandoned.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face puckered, the expression so devastated that Charlie leaned toward her automatically, one hand reaching out, looking for some way to help. I glared at her suspiciously. What was she doing?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alice, honey, why don\u0027t you come stay with us,\" Charlie offered. \"I hate to think of you all alone in that big house.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed. Something squashed my foot under the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ow!\" I protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie turned to me. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice shot me a frustrated look. I could tell she thought that I was very slow tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stubbed my toe,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh.\" He looked back at Alice. \"So, how \u0027bout it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped on my foot again, not quite so hard this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er, Dad, you know, we don\u0027t really have the best accommodations here. I bet Alice doesn\u0027t want to sleep on my floor. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie pursed his lips. Alice pulled out the devastated expression again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe Bella should stay up there with you,\" he suggested. \"Just until your folks get back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, would you, Bella?\" Alice smiled at me radiantly. \"You don\u0027t mind shopping with me, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" I agreed. \"Shopping. Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When are they leaving?\" Charlie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice made another face. \"Tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When do you want me?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After dinner, I guess,\" she said, and then put one finger to her chin, thoughtful. \"You don\u0027t have anything going on Saturday, do you? I want to get out of town to shop, and it will be an all-day thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not Seattle,\" Charlie interjected, his eyebrows pulling together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not,\" Alice agreed at once, though we both knew Seattle would be plenty safe on Saturday. \"I was thinking Olympia, maybe. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll like that, Bella.\" Charlie was cheerful with relief. \"Go get your fill of the city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, Dad. It\u0027ll be great.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith one easy conversation, Alice had cleared my schedule for the battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward returned not much later. He accepted Charlie\u0027s wishes for a nice trip without surprise. He claimed they were leaving early in the morning, and said goodnight before the usual time. Alice left with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI excused myself soon after they left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t be tired,\" Charlie protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little,\" I lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No wonder you like to skip the parties,\" he muttered. \"It takes you so long to recover.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpstairs, Edward was lying across my bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What time are we meeting with the wolves?\" I murmured as I went to join him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In an hour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s good. Jake and his friends need to get some sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They don\u0027t need as much as you do,\" he pointed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI moved to another topic, assuming he was about to try to talk me into staying home. \"Did Alice tell you that she\u0027s kidnapping me again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"Actually, she\u0027s not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at him, confused, and he laughed quietly at my expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m the only one who has permission to hold you hostage, remember?\" he said. \"Alice is going hunting with the rest of them.\" He sighed. \"I guess I don\u0027t need to do that now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re kidnapping me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about that briefly. No Charlie listening downstairs, checking on me every so often. And no houseful of wide-awake vampires with their intrusively sensitive hearing. . . . Just him and me - really alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that all right?\" he asked, concerned by my silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well . . . sure, except for one thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What thing?\" His eyes were anxious. It was mind-boggling, but, somehow, he still seemed unsure of his hold on me. Maybe I needed to make myself more clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why didn\u0027t Alice tell Charlie you were leaving tonight?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, relieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI enjoyed the trip to the clearing more than I had last night. I still felt guilty, still afraid, but I wasn\u0027t terrified anymore. I could function. I could see past what was coming, and almost believe that maybe it would be okay. Edward was apparently fine with the idea of missing the fight . . . and that made it very hard not to believe him when he said this would be easy. He wouldn\u0027t leave his family if he didn\u0027t believe it himself. Maybe Alice was right, and I did worry too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe got to the clearing last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper and Emmett were already wrestling - just warming up from the sounds of their laughter. Alice and Rosalie lounged on the hard ground, watching. Esme and Carlisle were talking a few yards away, heads close together, fingers linked, not paying attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was much brighter tonight, the moon shining through the thin clouds, and I could easily see the three wolves that sat around the edge of the practice ring, spaced far apart to watch from different angles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was also easy to recognize Jacob; I would have known him at once, even if he hadn\u0027t looked up and stared at the sound of our approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are the rest of the wolves?\" I wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They don\u0027t all need to be here. One would do the job, but Sam didn\u0027t trust us enough to just send Jacob, though Jacob was willing. Quil and Embry are his usual . . . I guess you could call them his wingmen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jacob trusts you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward nodded. \"He trusts us not to try to kill him. That\u0027s about it, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you participating tonight?\" I asked, hesitant. I knew this was going to be almost as hard for him as being left behind would have been for me. Maybe harder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll help Jasper when he needs it. He wants to try some unequal groupings, teach them how to deal with multiple attackers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a fresh wave of panic shattered my brief sense of confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were still outnumbered. I was making that worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at the field, trying to hide my reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the wrong place to look, struggling as I was to lie to myself, to convince myself that everything would work out as I needed it to. Because when I forced my eyes away from the Cullens - away from the image of their playfighting that would be real and deadly in just a few days - Jacob caught my eyes and smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the same wolfy grin as before, his eyes scrunching the way they did when he was human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard to believe that, not so long ago, I\u0027d found the werewolves frightening - lost sleep to nightmares about them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew, without asking, which of the others was Embry and which was Quil. Because Embry was clearly the thinner gray wolf with the dark spots on his back, who sat so patiently watching, while Quil - deep chocolate brown, lighter over his face - twitched constantly, looking like he was dying to join in the mock fight. They weren\u0027t monsters, even like this. They were friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriends who didn\u0027t look nearly as indestructible as Emmett and Jasper did, moving faster than cobra strikes while the moonlight glinted off their granite-hard skin. Friends who didn\u0027t seem to understand the danger involved here. Friends who were still somewhat mortal, friends who could bleed, friends who could die. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward\u0027s confidence was reassuring, because it was plain that he wasn\u0027t truly worried about his family. But would it hurt him if something happened to the wolves? Was there any reason for him to be anxious, if that possibility didn\u0027t bother him? Edward\u0027s confidence only applied to one set of my fears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to smile back at Jacob, swallowing against the lump in my throat. I didn\u0027t seem to get it right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob sprang lightly to his feet, his agility at odds with his sheer mass, and trotted over to where Edward and I stood on the fringe of things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jacob,\" Edward greeted him politely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob ignored him, his dark eyes on me. He put his head down to my level, as he had yesterday, cocking it to one side. A low whimper escaped his muzzle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine,\" I answered, not needing the translation that Edward was about to give. \"Just worried, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob continued to stare at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wants to know why,\" Edward murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob growled - not a threatening sound, an annoyed sound - and Edward\u0027s lips twitched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He thinks my translations leave something to be desired. What he actually thought was, \u0027That\u0027s really stupid. What is there to be worried about?\u0027 I edited, because I thought it was rude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI halfway smiled, too anxious to really feel amused. \"There\u0027s plenty to be worried about,\" I told Jacob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like a bunch of really stupid wolves getting themselves hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob laughed his coughing bark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward sighed. \"Jasper wants help. You\u0027ll be okay without a translator?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll manage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward looked at me wistfully for one minute, his expression hard to understand, then turned his back and strode over to where Jasper waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat down where I was. The ground was cold and uncomfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob took a step forward, then looked back at me, and a low whine rose in his throat. He took another half-step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on without me,\" I told him. \"I don\u0027t want to watch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob leaned his head to the side again for a moment, and then folded himself on to the ground beside me with a rumbling sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really, you can go ahead,\" I assured him. He didn\u0027t respond, he just put his head down on his paws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared up at the bright silver clouds, not wanting to see the fight. My imagination had more than enough fuel. A breeze blew through the clearing, and I shivered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob scooted himself closer to me, pressing his warm fur against my left side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er, thanks,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few minutes, I leaned against his wide shoulder. It was much more comfortable that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clouds moved slowly across the sky, dimming and brightening as thick patches crossed the moon and passed on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbsently, I began pulling my fingers through the fur on his neck. That same strange humming sound that he\u0027d made yesterday rumbled in his throat. It was a homey kind of sound. Rougher, wilder than a cat\u0027s purr, but conveying the same sense of contentment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, I never had a dog,\" I mused. \"I always wanted one, but Ren��e\u0027s allergic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob laughed; his body shook under me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you worried about Saturday at all?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned his enormous head toward me, so that I could see one of his eyes roll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I could feel that positive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned his head against my leg and started humming again. And it did make me feel just a little bit better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So we\u0027ve got some hiking to do tomorrow, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rumbled; the sound was enthusiastic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It might be a long hike,\" I warned him. \"Edward doesn\u0027t judge distances the way a normal person does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob barked another laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI settled deeper into his warm fur, resting my head against his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was strange. Even though he was in this bizarre form, this felt more like the way Jake and I used to be - the easy, effortless friendship that was as natural as breathing in and out - than the last few times I\u0027d been with Jacob while he was human. Odd that I should find that again here, when I\u0027d thought this wolf thing was the cause of its loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe killing games continued in the clearing, and I stared at the hazy moon. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-3-eclipse-twilight-3/page-20.html","bookId":2025,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:14:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:14:22 PM"}
