On the surface he\u0027s impermeable, except a scar above his left brow tells the truth . . . he\u0027s human. His shirt outlines muscles you can get only from manual labor or working out regularly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen my eyes meet his gaze as we\u0027re sitting here staring at each other, time stops. Those eyes are piercing mine, and I can swear at this moment he senses the real me. The one without the attitude, without the facade. Just Brittany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would it take for you to go out with me?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I look like I\u0027m jokin\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Peterson wanders by us, saving me from answering. \"I\u0027m keeping my eyes on you two. Alex, we missed you last week. What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I kinda fell onto a knife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shakes her head in disbelief, then moves away to harass other partners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at Alex, wide-eyed. \"A knife? You\u0027re kidding, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope. I was cuttin\u0027 a tomato, and wouldn\u0027t ya know the thing flung up and sliced my shoulder open. The doc stapled me back together. Wanna see?\" he asks as he starts pulling up his sleeve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slap a hand over my eyes. \"Alex, don\u0027t gross me out. And I don\u0027t believe for one second a knife flung out of your hand. You were in a knife fight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never answered my question,\" he says, not admitting or denying my theory about his wound. \"What would it take for you to go out with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. I wouldn\u0027t go out with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet if we make out you\u0027ll change your mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As if that\u0027ll ever happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your loss.\" Alex stretches his long legs in front of him, his chem book resting in his lap. He looks at me with chocolate brown eyes that are so intense I swear they could hypnotize someone. \"You ready?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a nanosecond, as I\u0027m staring into those dark eyes, I wonder what it would be like to kiss Alex. My gaze drops to his lips. For less than a nanosecond, I can almost feel them coming closer. Would his lips be hard on mine, or soft? Is he a slow kisser, or hungry and fast like his personality?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\" I whisper as I lean closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The project,\" he says. \"Hand warmers. Peterson\u0027s class. Chemistry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, clearing all ridiculous thoughts from my overactive teenage mind. I must be sleep-deprived. \"Yeah, hand warmers.\" I open my chem book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brittany?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" I say, staring blindly at the words on the page. I have no clue what I\u0027m reading because I\u0027m too embarrassed to concentrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were lookin\u0027 at me like you wanted to kiss me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI force a laugh. \"Yeah, right,\" I say sarcastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody\u0027s watchin\u0027 if you want to, you know, try it. Not to brag, but I\u0027m somewhat of an expert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gives me a lazy smile, one that was probably created to melt girls\u0027 hearts all over the globe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex, you\u0027re not my type.\" I need to tell him something to stop him from looking at me like he\u0027s planning to do things to me I\u0027ve only heard about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You only like white guys?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop that,\" I say through gritted teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" he says, getting all serious. \"It\u0027s the truth, ain\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Peterson appears in front of us. \"How\u0027s that outline coming along?\" she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put on a fake smile. \"Peachy.\" I pull out the research I did at home and get down to business while Mrs. Peterson watches. \"I did some research on the hand warmers last night. We need to dissolve sixty grams of sodium acetate and one hundred millimeters of water at seventy degrees.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wrong,\" Alex says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look up and realize Mrs. Peterson is gone. \"Excuse me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex folds his arms across his chest. \"You\u0027re wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think you\u0027ve never been wrong before?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe says it as if I\u0027m a ditzy blond bimbo, which sets my blood to way past boiling. \"Sure I have,\" I say. I make my voice sound high and breathless, like a Southern debutante. \"Why, just last week I bought Bobbi Brown Sandwash Petal lip gloss when the Pink Blossom color would have looked so much better with my complexion. Needless to say the purchase was a total disaster,\" I say. He expected to hear something like that come out of my mouth. I wonder if he believes it, or from my tone realizes I\u0027m being sarcastic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bet,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Haven\u0027t you ever been wrong before?\" I ask him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely,\" he says. \"Last week, when I robbed that bank over by the Walgreens, I told the teller to hand over all the fifties he had in the till. What I really should have asked for was the twenties \u0027cause there were way more twenties than fifties.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, so he did get that I was putting on an act. And gave it right back to me with his own ridiculous scenario, which is actually unsettling because it makes us similar in some twisted way. I put a hand on my chest and gasp, playing along. \"What a disaster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I guess we can both be wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stick my chin in the air and declare stubbornly, \"Well, I\u0027m not wrong about chemistry. Unlike you, I take this class seriously.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s have a bet, then. If I\u0027m right, you kiss me,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if I\u0027m right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Name it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s like taking candy from a baby. Mr. Macho Guy\u0027s ego is about to be taken down a notch, and I\u0027m all too happy to be the one to do it. \"If I win you take me and the class project seriously,\" I tell him. \"No teasing me, no making ridiculous comments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Deal. I\u0027d feel terrible if I didn\u0027t tell you I have a photographic memory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex, I\u0027d feel terrible if I didn\u0027t tell you I copied the info straight from the book.\" I look at the research I\u0027d done, then flip open to the corresponding page in my chem book. \"Without looking, what does it need to be cooled at?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex is a guy who thrives on challenges. But this time the tough guy is going to lose. He closes his own book and stares at me, his jaw set. \"Twenty degrees. And it needs to be dissolved at one hundred degrees, not seventy,\" he answers confidently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scan the page, then my notes. Then back at the page again. I can\u0027t be wrong. Which page did I-- \"Oh, yeah. One hundred degrees.\" I look up at him in complete shock. \"You\u0027re right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You gonna kiss me now, or later?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right now,\" I say, which I can tell shocks him because his hands go still. At home, my life is dictated by my mom and dad. At school, it\u0027s different. I need to keep it that way, because if I have no control in every aspect of my life I might as well be a mannequin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" I take one of his hands in mine. I\u0027d never be this bold if we had an audience, and am thankful for the privacy of the nonfiction titles surrounding us. His breathing slows as I sit up on my knees and lean into him. I\u0027m ignoring the fact that his fingers are long and rough and that I\u0027ve never actually touched him before. I\u0027m nervous. I shouldn\u0027t be, though. I\u0027m the one in control this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can feel him restraining himself. He\u0027s letting me make the move, which is a good thing. I\u0027m afraid of what this boy would do if he let loose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI place his hand against my cheek so it cups my face and I hear him groan. I want to smile because his reaction proves I have the power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s unmoving as our eyes meet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime stops again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I turn my head into his hand and kiss the inside of his palm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There, I kissed you,\" I say, giving him back his hand and ending the game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Latino with the big ego got bested by a ditzy, blond bimbo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 14 Alex\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You call that a kiss?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, so I\u0027m in shock the girl put my hand on her creamy cheek. Damn, you\u0027d think I was on drugs by the way my body reacted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had me totally under her spell a minute ago. Then the pretty witch turned my game around so she was the one with the upper hand. She surprised me, that\u0027s for sure. I laugh, deliberately calling attention to us because I know it\u0027s exactly what she doesn\u0027t want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shh,\" Brittany says, hitting me on the shoulder to shut me up. When I laugh louder, she whacks my arm with the heavy chem book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy bad arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wince. \"Ow!\" The cut on my biceps feels like a million little bees are stinging it. Cabron me dolio!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bites her Bobbi Brown Sandwash Petal\u0027d frosted bottom lip, which in my opinion looks fine on her. Though I wouldn\u0027t mind seeing her in the Pink Blossom color, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I hurt you?\" she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I say through gritted teeth as I concentrate on her lip gloss instead of the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lift my sleeve to examine my wound, which now (thanks to my chem partner) has blood trickling from one of the staples the doc at the free clinic put in it after the fight at the park with the Satin Hoods. Brittany\u0027s got a pretty good whack for someone who probably weighs a buck ten soaking wet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sucks in her breath and scoots away. \"Oh my God! I didn\u0027t mean to hurt you, Alex. Really, I didn\u0027t. When you threatened to show me the scar, you lifted your left sleeve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t really gonna show you,\" I say. \"I was fuckin\u0027 with you. It\u0027s okay,\" I tell her. Geez, you\u0027d think the girl never saw red blood before. Then again, her blood probably runs blue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s not okay,\" she insists while shaking her head. \"Your stitches are bleeding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re staples,\" I correct her, trying to lighten the mood. The girl is even whiter than she usually is. And she\u0027s breathing heavy, almost panting. If she passes out, I swear I\u0027m losing the bet with Lucky. If she can\u0027t handle a little streak of my blood, how\u0027s she gonna handle having sex with me? Unless we\u0027re not naked, so she doesn\u0027t have to see my various scars. Or if it\u0027s dark, then she can pretend I\u0027m someone white and rich. Fuck that, I want the lights on ... I want to feel all of her against me and want her to know it\u0027s me she\u0027s with and not some other culero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex, are you okay?\" Brittany asks, looking totally concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShould I tell her I was spacing out while thinking about us having sex?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. P. walks up the aisle with a stern look on her face. \"This is a library, you two. Keep it down.\" But then she notices the small line of blood snaking down my arm and staining my sleeve. \"Brittany, help him to the nurse. Alex, next time come to school with that thing bandaged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t I get sympathy, Mrs. P.? I\u0027m bleedin\u0027 to death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do something to help mankind or the planet, Alex. Then you\u0027ll, get my sympathy. People who get into knife fights don\u0027t earn anything from me except disgust. Now go get cleaned up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrittany lifts my books off my lap and says in a shaky voice, \"Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can hold the books,\" I tell her as I follow her out of the library. I\u0027m pressing my sleeve against the wound, hoping to stop more blood from leaking out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s walking ahead of me. If I tell her I need help walking because I feel faint, will she believe me and come to my rescue? Maybe I should stumble . . . although knowing her she wouldn\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight before we reach the nurse\u0027s office, she turns around. Her hands are shaking. \"I\u0027m so sorry, Alex. I di--didn\u0027t m--mean--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s freaking out. If she cries, I won\u0027t know what to do. I\u0027m not used to crying chicks. I don\u0027t think Carmen cried once during our entire relationship. In fact, I\u0027m not sure Carmen has tear ducts. That turned me on, because emotional chicks scare me. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-11.html","bookId":2767,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM"}
