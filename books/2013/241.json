I view my own brilliance with irony’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘To what end?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why, to make me humble.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Are we going to follow Icarium and his pet Gral all afternoon?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I am the only living native of Cabal, Samar Dev, to have seen with my own eyes our god. Is it any wonder I follow him?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod? He’s not a god. He’s a damned Jhag from the Odhan west of Seven Cities. Suffering a tragic curse, but then, aren’t they all? A figure well ahead of Icarium and Taralack Veed caught her attention. A figure tall, hulking, with a shattered face and a huge stone sword strapped to its back. ‘Oh no,’ she murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What is it?’ Senior Assessor asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He’s seen him.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Samar Dev?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was behind her now, and she was hurrying forward, roughly pushing past people. Expectations? Most certainly. Compromise? Not a chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the sconces had a faulty valve and had begun producing thick black tendrils of smoke that coiled like serpents in the air, and Uruth’s coughing echoed like barks in the antechamber. His back to the door leading to the throne room, Sirryn Kanar stood with crossed arms, watching the two Tiste Edur. Tomad Sengar was pacing, walking a path that deftly avoided the other waiting guards even as he made a point of pretending they weren’t there. His wife had drawn her dark grey robe about herself, so tight she reminded Sirryn of a vulture with its wings folded close. Age had made her shoulders slightly hunched, adding to the avian impression, sufficient to draw a half-smile to the guard’s mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No doubt this waiting amuses you,’ Tomad said in a growl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘So you were watching me after all.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I was watching the door, which you happen to be standing against.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContemplating kicking through it, no doubt. Sirryn’s smile broadened. Alas, you’d have to go through me, and that you won’t do, will you? ‘The Emperor is very busy.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘With what?’ Tomad demanded. ‘Triban Gnol decides everything, after all. Rhulad just sits with a glazed look and nods every now and then.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You think little of your son.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat struck a nerve, he saw, as husband and wife both fixed hard eyes on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We think less of Triban Gnol,’ Uruth said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no need to comment on that observation, for Sirryn well knew their opinions of the Chancellor; indeed, their views on all Letherii. Blind bigotry, of course, all the more hypocritical for the zeal with which the Edur had embraced the Letherii way of living, even as they sneered and proclaimed their disgust and contempt. If you are so dis-gusted, why do you still suckle at the tit, Edur? You had your chance at destroying all this. Vs. And our own whole terrible civilization. No, there was little that was worth saying to these two savages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt more than heard the scratch at the door behind him, and slowly straightened. ‘The Emperor will see you now.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTomad wheeled round to face the door, and Sirryn saw in the bastard’s face a sudden strain beneath the haughty facade. Beyond him, Uruth swept her cloak back, freeing her arms. Was that fear in her eyes? He watched her move up to stand beside her husband, yet it seemed all they drew from that proximity was yet another tension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStepping to one side, Sirryn Kanar swung open the door. ‘Halt in the tiled circle,’ he said. ‘Step past it and a dozen arrows will find your body. No warning will be voiced. By the Emperor’s own command. Now, proceed. Slowly.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, a Tiste Edur and four Letherii soldiers approached the city’s west gate on lathered horses. A shout from the Edur sent pedestrians scattering from the raised • road. The five riders were covered in mud and two bore wounds. The swords of the two whose scabbards were not empty were blood-crusted. The Edur was one of those with-out weapons, and from his back jutted the stub of an arrow, its iron head buried in his right scapula. Blood soaked his cloak where the quarrel had pinned it to his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis warrior was dying. He had been dying for four days. Another hoarse shout from the Tiste Edur, as he led his ragged troop beneath the gate’s arch, and into the city of Letheras.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Errant studied Rhulad Sengar, who had sat motionless since the Chancellor had returned to announce the imminent arrival of Tomad and Uruth. Was it some faltering of courage that had kept the Emperor from demanding their immediate presence? There was no way to tell. Even the Chancellor’s cautious queries had elicited nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLanterns burned on. The traditional torches breathed out smoke, their flickering light licking the walls. Triban Gnol stood, hands folded, waiting. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-241.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
