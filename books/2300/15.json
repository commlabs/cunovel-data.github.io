{"id":93978,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"\u003cp\u003eCara woke late Monday morning after a long and restless night. She had dreamed of vampires-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evampires chasing her, catching her, ripping out her throat, and drinking her blood. Vampires with hideous red eyes and skin as pale as death, their skeletal hands like claws as they reached for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBanishing all thoughts of vampires from her mind, she went into the bathroom, brushed her teeth and her hair, pulled on a pair of jeans, boots, and a sweater, and left the hotel. The library was closed on Sundays and Mondays, and the day stretched before her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped at a nearby cafe for pancakes and lots of strong coffee, then drove to the garage where Vince worked. She had expected to find the place closed up tight, but the big doors were open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter parking her car in front, she walked around the corner to the entrance of the garage. The doors were open, but there were no lights on inside. She found Vince in his office in the back of the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeated behind a battered oak desk with his feet propped up on one corner, he was talking on the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA large gray and white cat slept on top of a battered metal filing cabinet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelief flooded through Cara, leaving her feeling momentarily weak. The sun was high in the sky and Vince was up and awake. He couldn\u0027t be a vampire. Her father had been mistaken. She wondered what had made him think Vince was a vampire in the first place, then put the thought from her mind. She didn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknow a lot about the Undead, but everybody knew they slept in their coffins during the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince smiled at her, then held up one finger, indicating he\u0027d be done in a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCara glanced around the garage. There were three cars inside, all with their hoods up. A couple of big red metal tool chests stood against the wall to her left. Metal shelves lined the opposite wall. A wooden table was littered with tools and rags and greasy auto parts. It occurred to her that she had never seen her father putter around the house or work on his car or do any of the other mundane things most fathers did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" Vince called as he hung up the receiver, \"what brings you here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled as he rounded the desk toward her, then shrugged. \"It\u0027s my day off and I didn\u0027t have anything else to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m glad you came by.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess you\u0027re busy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"But never too busy for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled, warmed by his words and the welcome in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does your cat have a name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. I just call him Cat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not very imaginative of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"He\u0027s not really my cat. He just lives here. Can I get you something to drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you have?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Root beer, 7-Up, orange soda, Coke.\" He kept a Coke machine stocked for his clients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"7-Up sounds good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got her a can from the machine, popped the top, and handed it to her. \"So, how was your date with the stiff?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a face at him. \"It was all right. We went to dinner and then dancing at The Nocturne.\" She waited, hoping he would tell her what he had done last night When he didn\u0027t, she said, \"My parents showed up at the club.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grunted softly. \"Checking up on you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so. They have Di Giorgio for that.\" She frowned, wondering if Di Giorgio would still be trailing her now that she had moved out of the house. She didn\u0027t remember seeing him this morning, but then, she hadn\u0027t been looking. She\u0027d had thoughts only for Vince.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned against a corner of his desk, waiting for her to go on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStalling, Cara sipped her drink, wondering if she should say anything. She wanted to talk to someone about her parents but she didn\u0027t think anyone would believe her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it, Cara?\" Vince asked. \"Is something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I moved out of my house last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did?\" he asked, frowning. \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found out something about my parents that bothered me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on,\" he said, his expression suddenly guarded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anton told me that my parents are... I didn\u0027t want to believe him, but I guess he was right.\" She looked up at him, her eyes shining with tears. \"It\u0027s just so... so, I don\u0027t know. So unbelievable. I...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on, darlin\u0027. What did he tell you about your parents?\" Vince asked, though he had a pretty good idea about what she was going to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said they\u0027re vampires.\" She waited for him to laugh at her gullibility, to tell her she was crazy and that Anton had been making a bad joke. He did none of those things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did your parents say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My father told me it was true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that\u0027s why you moved out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course! Didn\u0027t you hear what I said? They\u0027re vampires!\" She shuddered. \"How can I stay there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve lived with them your whole life, Cara. Have they ever hurt you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, no, but...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They obviously love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared up at him. \"Why are you defending them? Don\u0027t you understand? They\u0027re not human!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince blew out a sigh; then, knowing he was making a huge mistake, he took her into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSetting the soda can on the desk, Cara sagged against him, her cheek resting against his chest, her arms sliding around his waist. \"My father said you were a vampire, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went suddenly still. \"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know why he said that. I mean, it can\u0027t be true,\" she said with a forced laugh, \"or you\u0027d be sleeping in your coffin, so why would he say such a thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" Vince swore under his breath. Blast! What should he do now? Tell her the truth? Wait?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHope she never found out? \"Cara...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at him, her eyes wide. Innocent. Vulnerable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should tell her the truth, he thought, before it was too late, before things got out of hand. She\u0027d hate him, sure, but better now than later. \"Listen, Cara...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, Cordova, my car ready yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVince put Cara away from him as the owner of the Dodge he had been working on earlier sauntered into the garage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not quite, Murph,\" Vince said. \"I need another thirty minutes or so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurph glanced at Cara, then looked at Vince and grinned. \"Yeah, I can see that. Mind if I grab a Coke while I wait?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, help yourself.\" Vince took Cara\u0027s hand in his. \"Why don\u0027t I pick you up tonight, say around eight?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can talk about it more then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. I\u0027m staying at the hotel on Fourth Street. Room 302.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, I\u0027ll see you later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched her walk away, wishing he knew what the hell he was going to tell her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-touch-children-of-the-night-2/page-15.html","bookId":2300,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:51 PM"}
