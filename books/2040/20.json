Over the next few days, I just kept thinking about what Rurik had said, that no other monarch save my father had ruled more than one kingdom in recent history. It had taken great power and magic for me to exert my dominance over the lands.... Were they feeding it back to me in return? I certainly felt stronger with them, but I\u0027d never expected any sort of unconscious physical manifestation. What else was I capable of? What could I make the land do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t mention the matter to anyone, not even Kiyo. He\u0027d seen the red flowers but brushed them off. If I told him about the Thorn Land, I feared he\u0027d grow upset about the thought of my magic increasing. He grudgingly accepted what I already possessed but still feared it would turn me into my father, no heir needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd although I\u0027d felt physically better in the Otherworld, I grew weak again after a day or so back in Tucson. I didn\u0027t mention this to Kiyo either, but Jasmine was around enough to pick up on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are they calling to you again?\" she asked over breakfast one day. She was devouring Pop-Tarts, another love we apparently shared. I was too worried to have an appetite and simply watched. \"You look like crap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I said, drumming my fingers against a glass of water. \"There\u0027s no precedent for this - at least not anymore. No one knows what to expect from me having two kingdoms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet Dorian would know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bet he would too, but I shook my head. \"He\u0027s not all-knowing no matter how much he wants to be,\" I countered. \"And I\u0027m done with him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\" She didn\u0027t fight it. For a while, she\u0027d kept telling me I\u0027d made a mistake in breaking up with Dorian, but Kiyo had been growing on her. I still wasn\u0027t sure if she approved, but at least I didn\u0027t have to listen to teen advice about my love life anymore. \"But you might just have to go back soon. I mean, think about it. You\u0027re bound to two lands in the Otherworld. Aren\u0027t the lands and the monarch one? Part of you\u0027s there. It makes sense you\u0027d have to be there twice as much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI winced at the idea, though it had been on my mind too. \"If I were there any more, I\u0027d be living there permanently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallowed the last of some crust. \"You may not have a choice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer flippant tone irritated me. \"There\u0027s always a choice. I rule them. They don\u0027t rule me.\" I stood up abruptly and briefly became dizzy. It felt like the lands were mocking me. Damn it, I thought. You will not call me back so quickly. I\u0027m staying in this world for a while. I\u0027ll come and go when I please. \"I just need to stop thinking about it. I\u0027m going to see if Lara\u0027s got a job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" said Jasmine dryly. \"That\u0027ll fix everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLara did have a job for me, several actually. Even though she was all but living with Tim - in my house - she still kept meticulous records and took all my calls. She looked disappointed that I only accepted one from her growing list of jobs, a small one at that: a simple haunting that would probably take about five minutes. She said nothing, but I knew that she worried if I didn\u0027t make any money, she wouldn\u0027t either. So, remembering Enrique\u0027s comment about needing help but not being able to trust anyone, I gave her his card with the suggestion she call about part-time work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you firing me?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled as I gathered up all my weapons. \"No, but I want you to have a backup plan in case you get laid off.\" Her eyes widened in alarm at the joke. Or, I suddenly wondered, was it a joke?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI brought Jasmine with me to the job because I still felt uneasy about leaving her alone. Besides, she was finally getting her fill of the human world, and I had a feeling her insistence on me returning to the Otherworld was partly selfish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, after I\u0027d finished the job, I kind of regretted bringing a witness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow,\" she said, as we drove home. \"You got your ass kicked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo. This was what it was like having a sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I banished it, didn\u0027t I? You saw it go to the Underworld.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" she admitted, \"but it sure did take a long time. I felt like I could have done it, and I\u0027ve never banished anything before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gritted my teeth, refraining from commenting that I still had her chains. The troubling thing was, I had kind of sucked. I\u0027d been in no real danger - not with a ghost that minor - but it had beaten me up more than it should have. I was off my game, a little slower, a little weaker. I\u0027d walked away with some bruises and now noticed as we drove that my shoulder itched. For a moment, I thought the ghost must have hit me there, but there was no pain. The stitches. I\u0027d nearly forgotten about them, now that they\u0027d finally been able to heal. My skin had probably started to grow over the threads. I needed them out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one was at my house, much to my disappointment. I\u0027d hoped Kiyo had stopped by and could remove the stitches. Trying to be optimistic, I decided he must be pulling a shift at the veterinary hospital and wasn\u0027t with Maiwenn. Thus far, I\u0027d heard no official word from her about my new double-queen status. Other monarchs had weighed in, though. Some had responded by showering me with congratulatory gifts and groveling. Others had let me know - in an amiable way - about other monarchs they were pals with, monarchs with big armies. It turned out everyone did fear the Iron Crown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI called my regular doctor, hoping to get an appointment this week as backup, in case Kiyo stayed absent. To my pleasant surprise, they\u0027d had a cancellation that afternoon and could remove the stitches right away. It was good news for me but an annoyance for Jasmine, who\u0027d just gotten comfortable on the couch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, come on,\" she said, stretching out. \"We just got home. Can\u0027t you please leave me here? I promise not to conquer the world or get pregnant while you\u0027re gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know,\" I said, \"Lara and Tim had sex right where you\u0027re lying.\" She jumped up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA half hour later, we arrived at my doctor\u0027s office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left Jasmine in the waiting room, deeming her safe enough with her iPod and magazines for the five minutes it would take to remove my stitches. Maybe she\u0027d read some contraception pamphlets to pass the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They did this in the ER?\" the doctor asked when I was admitted to an examination room and had taken off my shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d been seeing Dr. Moore for a couple years now. She was a pleasant, mid-fortyish woman who had eventually learned not to ask too many questions about my injuries. She thought I was a \"contractor\" who practiced martial arts on the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not exactly,\" I said. \"I tore the ones the ER did, so my boyfriend had to redo them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took hold of tweezers and a tiny pair of scissors and leaned over. \"Well, his work\u0027s neat, and it didn\u0027t get infected. If I\u0027d seen you when this happened, I would have confined you to your bed. I would have known better than to assume you wouldn\u0027t promptly rip these out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I really pulled one over on the other doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snorted a small laugh and proceeded to pull the stitches out. They stung where they tugged the skin, but honestly, it was nothing compared to my normal wear and tear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you go,\" she said, stepping back. \"You\u0027ll have a scar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my shirt back on and faced her. \"Battle trophy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled her eyes, leaning against the wall with crossed arms. \"You shouldn\u0027t joke about that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry.\" I picked up my purse, but her expression said we weren\u0027t done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eugenie ... I don\u0027t ask many questions, not any more than I need to treat you, but I\u0027m worried about how often you come in with these kinds of injuries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only she knew how many I didn\u0027t come in for. \"I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no,\" she interrupted. \"I don\u0027t need to know all the details of your life. I try not to judge - but you might need to. There are jobs out there that are physical in nature. That\u0027s life. But whatever you\u0027re doing ... maybe you should reevaluate it. To be blunt, you look terrible today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that.\" Crap. I could hardly explain that it was the residual aftereffects of a magical battle in the Otherworld, during which I\u0027d fought for dominion of a fairy kingdom and become its new master, thus doubling my reign. \"I\u0027m just, uh, coming down with something. Just kind of tired, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe arched her eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDouble crap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let\u0027s do some quick blood and urine tests,\" she said, straightening up. \"Check your electrolytes, thyroid ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fumbled for an excuse. I\u0027d never been comfortable with those kinds of tests since discovering I had gentry blood. I was pretty sure human medicine couldn\u0027t detect that sort of thing, but I didn\u0027t want to take any chances. \"I don\u0027t have time. My sister\u0027s waiting for me in the lobby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure she\u0027ll be okay,\" said Dr. Moore. \"This\u0027ll take five minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\" I sat back on the table, defeated. \"But can you send someone to make sure she\u0027s still out there? She\u0027s the sullen one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Moore\u0027s nurse returned to send me to the bathroom and then drew blood when I came back. She was in the middle of telling me they would send the tests out to a lab, when Dr. Moore herself stuck her head back in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can we talk for a moment?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nurse discreetly left, and once we were alone, I braced for another lecture about my lifestyle. \"I really need to get back to my sister,\" I told her. \"You don\u0027t know what she\u0027s capable of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eugenie.\" Dr. Moore\u0027s voice was kind but firm. \"Most of those tests we have to wait on, but there are a few we do right here with urine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And, you\u0027re pregnant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about this for a moment and then enlightened her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose eyebrows rose again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your test came back positive. Now, we can\u0027t tell how far just from a urine test, but based on - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your test is wrong!\" I sprang up from the table. My world was starting to reel again. \"I can\u0027t be pregnant!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo her credit, she took my outburst calmly, but that was probably part of her training. \"The test is very accurate, and it would explain why you aren\u0027t feeling well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t be pregnant,\" I repeated adamantly. There was a mistake here. A terrible, terrible mistake, and she needed to understand that. Until she did, I refused even to process what she was claiming. \"I take my birth control pills. Every day. Same time. Just like I\u0027m supposed to. I\u0027m not going to lie: I do other stupid shit all the time. But not with pills. I take them perfectly. I did with the antibiotics too. I\u0027m careless with stitches but not prescriptions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat calm expression shifted to surprise. \"Antibiotics? When were you taking antibiotics?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pointed to my shoulder. \"When I got this. The ER doctor gave me a prescription.\" I frowned. \"What? Why are you looking at me like that? I told you: I took them correctly, all of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Antibiotics can negate birth control pills,\" she said. \"Didn\u0027t you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I ... What? No. That\u0027s not ... No.\" A mistake. A terrible, terrible mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Women taking both need to use some other form of contraception until the antibiotics have run their course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA horrible, cold feeling began spreading over me. \"How was I supposed to know that?\" I asked in a small voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your pharmacist should have told you when you got the antibiotics. The interaction would have shown up in your records.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought back to that night, how my mom and I had stopped at the place closest to the hospital. \"I didn\u0027t go to my usual pharmacy....\" And I had gotten out of there as fast as I could, not bothering to talk to the pharmacist because I\u0027d taken antibiotics lots of times in my life. I certainly hadn\u0027t bothered with the enclosed pamphlets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Moore seemed to think she\u0027d gotten through to me. \"Now, we can figure out how far along you are if you know when your last period - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I exclaimed. \"No, no, no. I can\u0027t be pregnant! Don\u0027t you understand? I can\u0027t be. I can\u0027t have a baby. I can\u0027t!\" I was shouting again and wondered if this place had security.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Calm down,\" Dr. Moore said. \"Everything will be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, no, it wouldn\u0027t. Everything wouldn\u0027t be all right. Nausea welled in me, nausea I\u0027d felt for a few weeks or so - and that had nothing to do with inheriting the Rowan Land. After all this time, after all the planning and lofty talk, after all my fears about Jasmine ... it was me. Human medicine had screwed me over. No, I had screwed me over. I\u0027d fucked up. My own carelessness had brought this about. Everything anyone had ever said about the Storm King prophecy began to run through my mind. Sformi, King\u0027s first grandson. An invasion of the human world. Led by his mother. Domination and blood. And I, I was bringing it about.... I was the instrument....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eugenie!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Moore was supporting me, and I had a feeling she\u0027d said my name a few times. She glanced at the door and opened her mouth, about to call her nurse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" I clutched at her white coat. \"Don\u0027t. Listen to me.\" My voice was raspy and desperate. \"I can\u0027t. I can\u0027t have a baby. Don\u0027t you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe peered at me through her glasses, regarding me knowingly. \"Then you don\u0027t have to. There are options - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can\u0027t have a boy, some voice inside me said. What if it\u0027s a girl?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" I interrupted her. \"When can you tell the gender?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat got a shocked look. \"You\u0027d base an abortion on gender?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - no, wait.\" Fuck. I couldn\u0027t think. I was panicked and scared and confused. I needed to get my head together. What did I do? I had to get rid of this baby, pure and simple. People did it all the time. It was easy in this day and age, right? \"I meant, how long until you can tell gender and if ... if there\u0027s anything wrong.\" I groped for something reasonable, something that wouldn\u0027t make me seem like a heartless woman who\u0027d kill her son. \"You can do those tests, right? Like, genetic tests? I ... I\u0027m so afraid of having a baby and having there be something wrong. My family has a bad history. My cousins have had babies with birth defects, and I can\u0027t ... I can\u0027t handle that. I have to know. I have to know ... right away ... as early as possible because otherwise I\u0027ll ...\" The lies rolled easily off my lips. Anything. Anything to know the gender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Moore studied me again. I still sounded crazy and scattered, I knew, but a little less than before. \"When was your last period?\" she asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned to her wall calendar. The numbers swam before me. I couldn\u0027t focus. How the hell could I remember that when the fate of the world was on the line? I thought about my last period and tried to link it to some event, something that would trigger a date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There.\" I pointed. \"It started on the fifth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, doing mental calculations. \"Which lines up with the antibiotics. You\u0027re almost nine weeks along, as the reckoning goes, though technically only seven since conception.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeven. Seven weeks ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re almost in the range for chorionic villus sampling,\" she said. Chorionic what? \"They don\u0027t like to do it unless it\u0027s necessary, though. There are risks for the fetus. They almost never do it for someone your age, who\u0027s in good health....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it can tell me?\" I said urgently. \"It can tell me what I need to know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It can tell you a lot. No test can tell you everything, but it can give you peace of mind ... especially if you really do have a bad family history ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid I ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do,\" I said. \"Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held my breath, knowing she was wavering here. Finally, she turned to her filing cabinet, rifling through it until she found a carbon form. She scrawled something in doctor\u0027s handwriting on it and handed it over. \"Here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a referral to an OB-GYN\u0027s office nearby. The form had my name, some boxes checked, and a few illegible words. I did make out CVS and emergency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emergency?\" I asked. I mean, it was, but I was surprised she\u0027d nailed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It means you\u0027ll get scheduled in right away. Most of these tests are backed up - because they aren\u0027t done this early. Give it to my nurse when you leave.\" She was writing something else as she spoke. \"She\u0027ll call them and schedule you - but you need to be aware they may refuse it when you\u0027re there, based on their judgment. I meant it: this isn\u0027t routine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy next words were hesitant. \"Then why are you doing it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I believe that in pregnancy, the mother\u0027s health outweighs everything else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMother\u0027s health. I didn\u0027t like thinking of myself as a mother. Fuck. This shouldn\u0027t even be an issue at all! We should be discussing abortions. Why did I care about gender? I didn\u0027t want a baby. I wasn\u0027t ready for a baby. Certainly not one who\u0027d fulfill a world-conquering prophecy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In this case,\" said Dr. Moore. \"Your mental health is especially concerning. Which is what this is for.\" She handed me the other piece of paper. It was a referral for a psychologist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eugenie, shock over an unplanned pregnancy is normal. Expected. But it\u0027s clear ... you have some very serious issues around this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had no idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have my nurse call for the test. Then schedule yourself a therapist appointment and a follow-up with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no way I could tell her I had no intention of going to therapy. I wasn\u0027t even sure about the follow-up. But I\u0027d gotten away with something, and I knew it. I nodded meekly. \"Thank you.\" I left before she could change her mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasmine\u0027s face was filled with irritation and impatience when I finally returned. \"That took forever,\" she said, tossing a magazine aside. \"How deep were those stitches?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that deep,\" I murmured. I walked toward my car on autopilot, still stunned. \"She was worried about how tired I was, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you can fix that when we go back to the Otherworld.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started the car, staring off into space for a few ponderous moments as numbers floated around in my head. Nine weeks, seven weeks. Two days. That was how long until my test. Two days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI refocused on my surroundings so I wouldn\u0027t get us into an accident. \"We aren\u0027t going to the Otherworld anytime soon,\" I replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasmine shot me a look that clearly expressed her feelings on that, but there must have been something in my own face that answered back because she didn\u0027t fight the issue anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we returned to my house, I put my purse and paperwork in my bedroom before sitting with Jasmine in her usual spot on the couch. Mindless TV suddenly seemed like a good idea ... except, well, it didn\u0027t do a very good job of taking my mind off of my problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePregnant. Conqueror of worlds. Storm King\u0027s heir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe. It was all on me: what had happened and what was to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hadn\u0027t been home long when Kiyo showed up. He gave me a cheerful grin and wore his white coat from work, meaning he must not have been cozying up with Maiwenn. Small blessing. His smile was enough to make Jasmine smile in return, but I couldn\u0027t muster one. There was nothing to smile about right now. Nothing good in this world. Nothing good in either world. He joined us on the couch, sandwiching me in between him and Jasmine, and caught hold of my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, how are you?\" he asked. He peered at my face, even though I was pointedly not looking at him. \"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine,\" I lied. \"Tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStorm King\u0027s first grandson will conquer the human world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s been like that all day,\" said Jasmine. \"She needs to go back to the Otherworld but won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that true?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d have a problem with that,\" I said. \"You\u0027ve always wanted me to stay away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but not if it\u0027s affecting you like this. You really look sick, Eug.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She also got beat up by a ghost,\" Jasmine added helpfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" I glared. \"I did not!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKiyo chuckled and pulled me closer. \"Stop playing tough. Go to the Otherworld tomorrow. I\u0027ll come with you, so it won\u0027t be as bad.\" He relaxed, and there was a finality in his voice that I didn\u0027t like. I didn\u0027t like his presumption. I also wasn\u0027t entirely sure I should be going to the Otherworld, in light of recent developments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlowers. Flowers everywhere, everywhere I step. I\u0027m the land, and the land is me. Where I bring life, the land does too....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr death. I could bring death as well. It was my choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver and over. The words in my head were all I heard. I didn\u0027t hear the TV, or Kiyo and Jasmine\u0027s occasional comments. I didn\u0027t really hear when Kiyo said he\u0027d make dinner and went to drop off his overnight bag in my bedroom. But I did hear him when he came raging back to the living room, waving my CVS referral form in the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eugenie!\" His voice was a roar, one that made Jasmine cringe and widen her eyes. \"What the hell is this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared up at him levelly, surprised I could be so calm in the face of that outrage, especially after the emotional upheaval I\u0027d been through all day. My own despair and shock had never left, but now I was able to push it down and meet Kiyo\u0027s eyes, as I allowed myself to finally acknowledge the other thought that had been bouncing around in my mind. Because along with the choices I had and the consequences I faced, there was one other matter to consider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d looked at the numbers, at the calendar. I\u0027d factored in the dates, the antibiotics, what had been done - or, perhaps most importantly, what hadn\u0027t been done. It was all very clear. There was no soap opera here. No talk show�Cworthy mystery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Congratulations,\" I told Kiyo. \"You\u0027re going to be a father. Again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/iron-crowned-dark-swan-3/page-20.html","bookId":2040,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:36:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:36:59 PM"}
