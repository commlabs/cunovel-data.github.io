Beneath the yellow bushes there were faint gleams of phosphorescent silver enclosed by a force field and identified by a low sign:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sangeet Mobilus, a blood-sucking perennial from Bisaj.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Extreme danger to all sentient species.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Do not intrude any portion of your body beyond the force field.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he sat on the bench, McKie thought about that sign.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The universe often mixed the beautiful and the dangerous.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;This was a deliberate mixture in the park.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The yellow bushes, the fragrant and benign Golden Iridens, had been mingled with Sangeet Mobilus.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The two supported each other and both thrived.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The ConSentient government which McKie served often made such mixtures . . . sometimes by accident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes by design.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe listened to the plashing of the fountain while the shadows thickened and the tiny border lights came on along the paths.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The tops of the buildings beyond the park became a palette where the sunset laid out its final display of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that instant, the Caleban contact caught him and he felt his body slip into the helpless communications trance.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The mental tendrils were immediately identified - Fannie Mae. And he thought, as he often had, what an improbable name that was for a star entity.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He heard no sounds, but his hearing centers responded as to spoken words, and the inward glow was unmistakable.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;It was Fannie Mae, her syntax far more sophisticated than during their earliest encounters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You admire one of us,\" she said, indicating his attention on the sun which had just set beyond the buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I try not to think of any star as a Caleban,\" he responded.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\"It interferes with my awareness of the natural beauty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Natural?\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;McKie, you don\u0027t understand your own awareness, nor even how you employ it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was her beginning -
