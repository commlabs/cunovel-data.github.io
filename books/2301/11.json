Oh, Lordy. Sitting in the restaurant with Cagin suddenly seemed a lot safer than accompanying a Vampire into his lair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was trying to think of a way to convince Raphael to take me home when he opened the car door and reached for my hand. The next thing I knew, he was leading me up the porch stairs. The front door, made of what looked like solid steel, opened seemingly of its own accord. Interior lights came on as I crossed the threshold ahead of Raphael.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of the door closing behind me sent a shiver down my spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Make yourself at home,” he invited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe living room, sparsely furnished, was decorated in earth tones. The main focus of the room was an enormous fireplace that took up most of one wall. I stared at it, thinking it could easily hold an elephant or two. A deep brown leather sofa was situated in front of the biggest television screen I had ever seen. A pair of matching leather chairs faced the sofa. The carpet beneath my feet was a dazzling white. A large painting hung over the fireplace. It depicted a black knight astride an equally black horse. A large green dragon loomed in the distance. A collection of dragons made of onyx, jade, pewter, and carved wood were scattered on the mantel amid several black candles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you mind if I look around?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Help yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn arched doorway to my left opened onto the kitchen. I peered through the doorway, my gaze sweeping the room, noting that the kitchen was bare except for a small black refrigerator and a microwave oven. The countertop was black granite; the floor was white tile. There were no windows in the room, which I thought was odd, especially for a kitchen, and no back door. I wondered if Rafe had plastered over the windows to block the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA short hallway opened off the kitchen. My feet made no sound on the thick carpet. The first door off the hall was a guest bathroom with a commode, sink, and a small shower. There were no windows in this room, and no mirrors. A small bedroom adjoined the bathroom. The walls were a pale moss green, the carpet white, the furnishings no more than a twin bed made of black wrought iron and an antique chest of drawers made of dark oak. Again, there were no mirrors in evidence, and no windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried the door at the end of the hallway, but it was locked. It was Rafe\u0027s room. I knew it as surely as I knew the sun would rise in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBacktracking, I returned to the living room, my feet sinking into the carpet\u0027s deep pile as I made my way to the sofa. I had never known anyone who had white carpeting before. My first thought was that bloodstains would be really hard to get out, but then I realized that he probably didn\u0027t bring his dinner home with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaphael sat beside me. He made a gesture with his hand, and a fire sprang to life in the hearth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should be a magician,” I muttered, remembering how he had opened the door and turned on the lights, all with a wave of his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Great Cordova,” he remarked with a grin. “I like the sound of that.” And then his expression turned serious. “What were you doing with Cagin?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wasn\u0027t ‘doing\u0027 anything with him. I was having dinner when he invited himself to join me. How did you know I was there, anyway?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As I said before, I could find you in the dark, ten feet down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told myself I should be annoyed that he had been following me, or at least looking for me, but I couldn\u0027t be angry because it proved that he had been thinking about me, maybe missing me, and that pleased me to no end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why does my being with Cagin make you so angry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t like him. I don\u0027t trust him. Can I get you something to drink?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like what?”A glass of blood in a crystal goblet? I banished the image from my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A glass of wine, a soft drink, a cup of coffee or tea?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked at him, surprised that he kept such a variety of beverages on hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently reading my mind again, he said, “I bought them the night after we met.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, you were that sure of me, were you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not sure,” he replied. “Hopeful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hopeful that you\u0027d get me here and have your wicked way with me?” I asked, only half kidding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, the way an indulgent parent might laugh at a precocious child. It reminded me that he was old enough to be my grandfather. Lord, in his eyes, I probablywas little more than an infant!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did Cagin want?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” The sudden change of topic gave me pause. One minute we were talking about intimate things and the next he was asking about a Were-creature. Was that why he had brought me here, to see if I had any inside information on the Weres? I lifted my chin defiantly. “He asked me out on another date.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRafe leaned forward, his hands clenched. “You didn\u0027t accept?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had his full attention now. “A girl has to date someone,” I said flippantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a move faster than my eyes could follow, he was towering over me. “We talked about this before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared up at him. The man could be scary as hell when he wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want your promise,” he said. “Now, tonight, that you won\u0027t see him again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can\u0027t help it if he shows up where I am. I mean, what am I supposed to do if he comes into my store? Run away?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That\u0027s a good start.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Like I could outrun a Were-tiger,” I muttered drily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaphael gazed down at me, his expression softening. “Forgive me,” he said, resuming his seat. “It\u0027s just that I\u0027m worried about you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Worried? About me? Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated, as though debating whether to tell me the hard truth or sugarcoat it with a lie. The truth won out. “You\u0027re important to me,” he said slowly, “and Cagin knows it. And until I know what side he\u0027s on, I\u0027d rather you stayed away from him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stared at Raphael, a sudden coldness sweeping through me. He didn\u0027t have to spell it out for me. Cagin and Raphael were enemies, that much was obvious. No doubt I would make an excellent hostage for the Werewolves. Even more frightening was the thought that, even though Raphael seemed fond of me, we hadn\u0027t known each other very long. There was no bond between us, no reason to think he would spill any secrets or turn traitor if my life was threatened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaving Oak Hollow was starting to sound better and better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaphael shook his head. “It\u0027s too late for you to leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop that!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted one brow. “Stop what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Reading my mind. It\u0027s very annoying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed softly. “I\u0027m sure it is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How do you do it, anyway? Are you psychic on top of everything else?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In a way, although I have to admit, most people aren\u0027t as easy to read as you are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And what makes me so easy to read?” I asked irritably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dragged his hand over his jaw, his expression thoughtful. “I\u0027m not sure, but I\u0027ve got a theory.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you like to share it with me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You won\u0027t like it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was sure of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you believe in soul mates?” he asked. “One woman made for one man, that sort of thing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling skeptical, I asked, “Do you believe in that sort of thing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t move, but he suddenly seemed closer. “I never used to, until I met you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA romantic Vampire. Just what I needed. “And what makes me so different from anyone else?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on, Kathy, I know you feel it, too, that connection between us. It was there the first night I walked into your store.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to contradict him, but I couldn\u0027t. I remembered all too clearly the night I had been in the back room at the bookstore. I had known the minute Raphael had entered the building. I\u0027d had no explanation for it at the time, and while I wasn\u0027t sure I believed that we had been made for each other, we did seem to have some kind of extraordinary awareness of one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogic made me shake my head in denial. He was sixty-two years older than I was, and a Vampire to boot. Unless fate was playing a really bad joke, there was no way on Earth that Raphael and I could be soul mates, or any other kind of mates, for that matter. And yet, even now, the attraction between us crackled like a live wire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We\u0027re supposed to be friends,” I said, my voice little more than a husky whisper. “Just friends. Remember?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded slowly, his gaze locked on mine. Dropping to his knees in front of me, he took one of my hands in his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I remember,” he said, his voice as rough around the edges as mine had been. “But I don\u0027t think it\u0027s possible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flames in the hearth seemed to burn brighter, hotter. It felt like the room was closing in on me as I tried to draw my gaze away from Raphael\u0027s and failed. “Stop that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever it is that you\u0027re doing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Honey, I\u0027m not doing anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t believe you.” It had to be some kind of Vampire magic. I mean, it just had to be. How could I feel this way about a Vampire, even if he was the best looking guy I had ever seen? I shook my head. “This…whatever it is I\u0027m feeling, I don\u0027t believe it\u0027s real. It can\u0027t be real.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How can I convince you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t know.” I pulled my hand from his and made a shooing motion. “For starters, you can give me some space.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever you want.” Rising, he backed up several paces, putting some distance between us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t help. My skin felt too tight; my blood felt like it was on fire. It was hard to think, hard to remember to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need to go to the restroom,” I said, and then wondered if Vampires had the same needs as humans. After all, they didn\u0027t eat….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look in his eyes told me he knew this for the ploy it was. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-master-children-of-the-night-3/page-11.html","bookId":2301,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:06:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:06:58 PM"}
