He reached for his gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stand still, Mr. Malone. Weapons are trained on you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the man from the cathedral,\" Stephanie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you we\u0027d meet again. And you, monsieur Claridon. You weren\u0027t that convincing in the asylum. Insane? Hardly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone searched the darkness. The sheer size of the chamber produced a confusion of noise. But he spotted human forms standing above them, before the upper row of shelving at the wooden railing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe counted four.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am, though, impressed by your knowledge, monsieur Claridon. Your deductions about the headstone seem logical. I always believed there was much to be learned from that marker. I, too, have been here before, rummaging through these shelves. Such a difficult endeavor. So much to explore. I do appreciate you narrowing the search. Reading the Rules of Caridad. Who would have thought?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaridon made the sign of the cross and Malone spotted fear in the man\u0027s eyes. \"May God protect us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come now, monsieur Claridon,\" the disembodied voice said. \"Do we need to involve heaven?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are His warriors.\" Claridon\u0027s voice trembled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what brings you to that conclusion?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who else could you be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps we are the police? No. You wouldn\u0027t believe that. Maybe we\u0027re adventurers--searchers--like you. But no. So, let\u0027s say for the sake of simplicity that we are His warriors. How can you three aid our cause?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one answered him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ms. Nelle possesses her husband\u0027s journal and the book from the auction. She\u0027ll contribute those.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Screw you,\" she spat out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pop, like a balloon bursting, sounded over the rain and a bullet careened off the table a few inches from Stephanie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bad answer,\" the voice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give them to him,\" Malone said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephanie glared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll shoot you next.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know?\" the voice asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I\u0027d do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chuckle. \"I like you, Mr. Malone. You\u0027re a professional.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStephanie reached into her shoulder bag and removed the book and journal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Toss them toward the door, between the shelves,\" the voice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did as instructed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA form appeared and retrieved them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone silently added one more man to the list. At least five were now in the archive. He felt the gun wedged at his waist beneath his jacket. Unfortunately, there was no way to retrieve it before at least one of them was shot. And only three bullets remained in the magazine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your husband, Ms. Nelle, managed to piece together many of the facts, and his deductions as to missing elements were generally correct. He was a remarkable intellect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it you\u0027re after?\" Malone asked. \"I only joined this party a couple of days ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We seek justice, Mr. Malone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it\u0027s necessary to run down an old man in Rennes-le-Chateau to achieve justice?\" He thought he\u0027d jostle the barrel and see what spilled out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And who would that be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ernst Scoville. He worked with Lars Nelle. Surely you knew of him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Malone, perhaps a year of retirement has dulled your skills. I\u0027d hope that you were better at interrogating when you were working full time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since you have the journal and the notebook, don\u0027t you have to be going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need that lithograph. Monsieur Claridon, please be so kind as to take it to my associate, there, beyond the table.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaridon clearly did not want to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother slap from a sound-suppressed weapon and a bullet thudded into the tabletop. \"I hate repeating myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone lifted the drawing and handed it to Claridon. \"Do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sheet was accepted in a hand that trembled. Claridon took a few steps beyond the spill of the weak lamp. Thunder pounded the air and rattled the walls. Rain continued to burst forth with fury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a new noise erupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGunfire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the lamp exploded in a burst of sparks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDE ROQUEFORT HEARD THE GUNSHOT AND SAW THE MUZZLE flash from near the archive\u0027s exit. Damn. Somebody else was here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was plunged into darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Move,\" he screamed to his men on the second-floor catwalk, and he hoped they knew what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMALONE REALIZED SOMEBODY HAD SHOT OUT THE LIGHT. THE woman. She\u0027d found another way in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs darkness overtook them, he grabbed Stephanie and they dropped to the floor. He was hoping the men above him had been likewise caught off guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brought out the gun from beneath his jacket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo more shots exploded from below, and the bullets sent the men above scurrying. Footsteps pounded on the wooden platform. He was more concerned about the man on the ground floor, but he\u0027d heard nothing from the direction where he\u0027d last seen him, nor had he heard anything from Claridon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe running stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoever you are,\" the man\u0027s voice said, \"must you interfere?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could ask you the same question,\" the woman said in a languid tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is not your business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I disagree.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You assaulted two of my brothers in Copenhagen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s say I ended your attack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There will be retribution.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come and get me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop her,\" the man yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack shapes rushed across overhead. Malone\u0027s eyes had adjusted and he made out a staircase at the far end of the catwalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe handed Stephanie the gun. \"Stay here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To repay a favor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crouched down and hustled forward, weaving through the shelves. He waited, then tackled one of the men as he leaped from the last tread. The size and shape of the man was reminiscent of Red Jacket, but this time Malone was ready. He brought a knee into the man\u0027s stomach, then pounded a fist to the back of the neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man went still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone surveyed the darkness and heard running a few aisles over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Please leave me be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaridon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDE ROQUEFORT HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THE DOOR THAT LED OUT of the archives. He\u0027d descended from the ramparts and knew the woman would want to make a hasty retreat, but her choices were limited. There was only the exit to the hall and one other, through the curator\u0027s office. But his man stationed there had just reported through the radio that all was quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe now knew she was the same person who\u0027d interfered in Copenhagen and probably the same one from last night in Rennes-le-Chateau. And that realization spurred him on. He must learn her identity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door leading out of the archives opened, then closed. In the wedge of light that splashed in from the hall he spied two legs lying prone on the floor between the shelves. He darted over and discovered one of his subordinates unconscious, a small dart planted in the neck. This brother had been stationed on the ground floor and had retrieved the notebook, journal, and lithograph.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich were nowhere to be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do as I instructed,\" he called out to his remaining men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raced for the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMALONE HEARD THE MAN\u0027S COMMAND AND DECIDED TO HEAD back to Stephanie. He had no idea what the men had been commanded to do, but he assumed it included them and wasn\u0027t good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crouched down and eased his way through the shelves, toward the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stephanie,\" he breathed out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here, Cotton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slipped close to her. All he could hear now was the rain. \"There must be another way out of here,\" she mouthed through the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe relieved her of the gun. \"Somebody left through the door. Probably the woman. I saw only one shadow. The others must have gone after Claridon and left through another exit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door leading out opened again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s him leaving,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stood and rushed back across the archives. At the exit Malone hesitated, heard and saw nothing, then led the way out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDE ROQUEFORT SPOTTED THE WOMAN RUNNING DOWN THE LONG gallery. She whirled and, not losing a step, fired a shot his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dove to the floor, and she disappeared around a corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came to his feet and bolted after her. Before she\u0027d fired, he\u0027d caught sight of the journal and the book in her grasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to be stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMALONE SAW A MAN, DRESSED IN BLACK TROUSERS AND A DARK turtleneck, gun in hand, turn a corner fifty feet away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is going to get interesting,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both ran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDE ROQUEFORT KEPT UP HIS PURSUIT. THE WOMAN WAS CERTAINLY attempting to leave the palace, and she seemed to know the geography. Every turn she took was the right one. She\u0027d deftly obtained what she came for, so he had to assume that her escape would not be left to chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough another portal, he entered a rib-vaulted hall. The woman was already at the far end, turning a corner. He trotted over and saw a wide stone staircase leading down. The Great Staircase of Honor. Once, lined with frescoes, broken by iron gates, and sheathed with Persian runners, the stairway had lent itself to the solemn majesty of pontifical ceremonies. Now the risers and walls were bare. The darkness at the bottom, some thirty yards away, was absolute. He knew below were exit doors into a courtyard. He heard the woman\u0027s footsteps as she descended but could not make out her form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he just fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen shots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMALONE HEARD WHAT SOUNDED LIKE A HAMMER REPEATEDLY striking a nail. One sound-suppressed shot after another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slowed his approach to a doorway ten feet ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHINGES SQUEALED AT THE BASE OF THE INK-BLACK STAIRWAY. DE Roquefort recognized the sound of a door groaning open. The storm outside grew louder. Apparently his indiscriminate shots had missed. The woman was leaving the palace. He heard footsteps behind him, then spoke into the mike clipped to his shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have what I wanted?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We do,\" was the reply through his earphone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in the Conclave Gallery. Mr. Malone and Ms. Nelle are behind me. Handle them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rushed down the staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMALONE SAW THE MAN IN THE TURTLENECK LEAVE THE CAVERNOUS hall that stretched out before them. Gun in hand, he ran ahead with Stephanie following.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree armed men materialized from other portals into the room and blocked their way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone and Stephanie stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please toss the gun aside,\" one of the men said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo way he could take them all before either he, Stephanie, or both of them went down. So he allowed the gun to clatter on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three men approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do we do now?\" Stephanie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m open to suggestions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing for you to do,\" another of the short-hairs said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stood still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Turn around,\" came the command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at Stephanie. He\u0027d been in tight spots before, a few just like the one they were facing. Even if he managed to subdue one or two, there was still the third man, and all were armed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thud was followed by a cry from Stephanie and her body collapsed to the floor. Before he could move toward her, the back of Malone\u0027s head was pounded with something hard and everything before him vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDE ROQUEFORT FOLLOWED HIS QUARRY, WHO RUSHED THROUGH the Place du Palais, quickly fleeing the empty plaza and winding a path through Avignon\u0027s deserted streets. The warm rain fell in steady sheets. The heavens suddenly opened, cleft by an immense flash of lightning that momentarily lifted the vault of darkness. Thunder shook the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey left buildings behind and came close to the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew, just ahead, the Pont St. Benezet stretched out across the Rhone. Through the storm he saw the woman navigate a path straight for the bridge\u0027s entrance. What was she doing? Why go there? No matter, he had to follow. She possessed the rest of what he\u0027d come to retrieve, and he did not plan to leave Avignon without the book and journal. Yet he wondered what the rain was doing to the pages. His hair was matted to his scalp, his clothes pasted to his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw a flash ten meters ahead of him as the woman fired a shot into the door that led to the bridge\u0027s entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe disappeared inside the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rushed to the door and carefully gazed inside. A ticket counter stood to his right. Souvenirs were displayed in more counters to the left. Three turnstiles led out onto the bridge. The incomplete span had long ago ceased being anything but a tourist attraction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman was twenty meters away, running down the bridge, out onto the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rushed forward and leaped over the turnstiles, racing after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Gothic chapel stood at the end of the second pylon. He knew that it was the Chapelle Saint-Nicholas. The remains of St Benezet, who was originally responsible for the bridge being built, were once preserved there. But the relics were lost during the Revolution and only the chapel remained--Gothic on top, Romanesque below. Which was where the woman had gone. Down the stone staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother greenish bolt of lightning flashed overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook the rain from his eyes and stopped at the top riser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he saw her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot below, but back on top, racing toward the end of the fourth span, which would take her halfway out into the Rhone with nowhere to go, since the spans to the other side of the river had washed away three hundred years ago. She\u0027d obviously used the stairs to dip beneath the chapel as a way to block any shot he may have wanted to take.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dashed after her, rounding the chapel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t want to shoot. He needed her alive. Even more important, he needed what she carried. So he sent a bullet to her left, at her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped and turned to face him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rushed forward, gun leveled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood at the end of the fourth span, nothing but darkness and water behind her. A clap of thunder violated the air. Wind came in wild gusts. Rain poured across his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wore a black bodysuit that matched her dark skin. She was lean and muscular, her head sheathed in a tight hood, only her face visible. She carried a gun in the left hand, a plastic shopping bag in the other. She extended the shopping back out over the edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s not get hasty,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I could simply shoot you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two reasons why you won\u0027t do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m listening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One, the bag will drop into the river and what you really want will be lost. And two, I\u0027m a Christian. You don\u0027t kill Christians.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know what I do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are a knight of the Templars, as are the others. You took an oath not to harm Christians.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no idea whether you\u0027re a Christian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So let\u0027s stick with reason one. Shoot me, the books swim in the Rhone. The swift current will take them away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently we seek the same thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a quick one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer arm stayed extended out over the edge and he contemplated where best to shoot her, but she was right--the bag would be gone long before he could traverse the ten feet that separated them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looks like we have a standoff,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t say that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe released her grip and the bag disappeared into the blackness. She then used his moment of surprise to raise her gun and fire, but de Roquefort pivoted left and dropped to the wet stones. When he shook the rain from his eyes, he saw the woman leap over the edge. He stood and rushed over, expecting to see the churning Rhone sweeping by, but instead below him was a stone platform, about eight feet down, part of a pylon that supported the outer arch. He saw the woman yank up the bag and disappear beneath the bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated only an instant, then jumped, landing on his feet. His middle-aged ankles rattled from the impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn engine roared and he saw a motorboat shoot out from under the far side of the bridge and speed away, toward the north. He raised his gun to fire, but a muzzle flash signaled she was firing, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lunged flat to more wet stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boat dissolved out of range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho was that vixen? Clearly, she knew what he was, though not who he was since she\u0027d not identified him. She also apparently understood the significance of the book and the journal. Most important, she knew his every move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came to his feet and stepped beneath the bridge, out of the rain, where the boat had been moored. She\u0027d also planned a clever escape. He was about to climb back up, using an iron ladder affixed to the bridge\u0027s exterior, when something in the darkness caught his attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bent down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA book lay on the soaked stone beneath the overpass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe brought it close to his eyes, straining to see what the damp pages contained, and read a few of the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLars Nelle\u0027s notebook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d lost it during her hasty retreat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe now possessed part of the puzzle--not all, but maybe enough--and he knew precisely how to learn the rest. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-templar-legacy-cotton-malone-1/page-36.html","bookId":2232,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:13:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:13:33 PM"}
