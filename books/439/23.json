{"id":45058,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXII. A NIGHT OF SONG","content":"HOME-SICKNESS AND ITS OUTPOURING IN MUSIC.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e IT WAS Sunday again, and the 200th Ind. still lingered near Nashville. For some inscrutible reason known only to the commanding officers the brigade had been for nearly a week in camp on the banks of the swift running Cumberland. They had been bright, sunshiny days, the last two of them. Much rain in the hill country had swollen the swift waters of the Cumberland and they fiercely clamored their devious way to the broad Ohio. The gentle roar as the rippling wavelets dashed against the rock bound shores sounded almost surf-life, but to Si, who had never heard the salt waves play hide-and-go-seek on the pebbly beach, the Cumberland\u0027s angry flood sang only songs of home on the Wabash. He had seen the Wabash raging in flood time and had helped to yank many a head of stock from its engulfing fury. He had seen the Ohio, too, when she ran bank full with her arched center carrying the Spring floods and hundreds of acres of good soil down to the continent-dividing Mississippi, and on out to sea. His strong arms and stout muscles had piloted many a boat-load of boys and girls through the Wabash eddies and rapids during the Spring rise, and as he stood now, looking over the vast width of this dreary waste of waters, a great wave of home-sickness swept over him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After all, Si was only a kid of a boy, like thousands of his comrades.\u0027 True, he was past his majority a few months, but his environment from youth to his enlistment had so sheltered him that he was a boy at heart.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The like precurse of fierce events and prologue to the omen coming on\" had as yet made small impression upon him. Grim visaged war had not frightened him much up to that time. He was to get his regenerating baptism of blood at Murfreesboro a few weeks later. Just now Si Klegg was simply a boy grown big, a little over fat, fond of mother\u0027s cooking, mother\u0027s nice clean feather beds, mother\u0027s mothering, if the truth must be told. He had never in his life before been three nights from under the roof of the comfortable old house in which he was born. He had now been wearing the blue uniform of the union a little more than three months, and had not felt mother\u0027s work-hardened hands smoothing his rebellious hair or seen her face or heard a prayer like she could make in all that three months.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Shucks!\" he said fretfully to himself as he looked back at the droning, half asleep brigade camp, and then off to the north, across the boiling yellow flood of waters that tumbled past the rocks far below him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A feller sure does git tired of doin\u0027 nothin\u0027.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Lusty, young, and bred to an active life, Si, while he did not really crave hustle and bustle, was yet wedded to \"keeping things moving.\" He had already forgotten the fierce suffering of his early marching—it seemed three years to him instead of three months back; he had forgotten the graybacks, the wet nights, the foraging expeditions, the extra guard duty and all that. There had been two days of soft Autumn sunshine in a camp that was almost ideal. Everything was cleaned up, mended up, and the men had washed and barbered themselves into almost dude-like neatness. Their heaviest duties had been lazy camp guard duty, which Shorty, growing indolent, had declared to be \"dumned foolishness,\" and the only excitement offered came from returning foraging parties. There was no lurking enemy to fear, for the country had been cleared of guerrillas, and in very truth the ease and quietness of the days of inactivity was almost demoralizing the men.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There had been no Sunday services. The 200th Ind. was sprawled out on the ground in its several hundred attitudes of ease, and those with whom they were brigaded were just as carelessly disposed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As Si sauntered aimlessly back to look for Shorty, the early twilight began to close in as the sun slid down behind the distant hills. Campfires began to glow as belated foragers prepared their suppers, and the gentle hum of voices came pleasantly to the ear, punctuated by laughter, often boisterous, but quite as often just the babbling, cheery laugh of carefree boys.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Si felt—well, Si was just plain homesick for mother and the girls, and one particular girl, whose front name was Annabel, and he almost felt as though he didn\u0027t care who knew it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The air was redolent with the odor of frying meat. Mingled with this were vagrant whiffs of cooking potatoes, onions, chickens, and the fragrance of coffee steaming to blackest strength, all telling tales of skillful and successful foraging, and it all reminded Si of home and the odors in his mother\u0027s kitchen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Si couldn\u0027t find Shorty, so he hunched down, silent and alone, beside his tent, a prey to the blue devils. It would soon be Christmas at home. He could see the great apple bins in the cellar; the pumpkins in the hay in the barn; the turkeys roosting above the woodshed; the yards of encased sausages in the attic; he could even smell the mince meat seasoning in the great stone jar; the honey in the bee cellar; the huge fruit cake in the milk pan in the pantry; since he could remember he seen and smelled all these, with 57 varieties of preserves, \"jells,\" marmalades, and fruit-butters thrown in for good measure at Christmas time. He had even contemplated with equanimity all these 21 Christmases, the dose of \"blue pills\" that inevitably followed over-feeding at Mother Klegg\u0027s, and now on his 22d Christmas he might be providing a target for a rebel bullet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Suddenly Si noticed that the dark had come; the fragrance of tobacco from hundreds of pipes was filling the air, and from away off in the distance the almost Indian Summer zephyrs were bringing soft rythmic sounds like—surely—yes, he caught it now, it was that mighty soother of tired hearts—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Jesus, lover of my soul,\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Let me to Thy bosom fly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; While the billows near me roll.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; While the tempest still is high.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Si shut his eyes lest the tear drops welling suddenly up fall on his uniform, not stopping to think that in the gloom they could not be seen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miles away the singers seemed to be when Si caught the first sounds, but as the long, swinging notes reached out in the darkness, squad after squad, company after company, regiment after regiment took up the grand old hymn until Si himself lifted up his not untuneful voice and with the thousands of others was pleading—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Hide me, oh, my Savior hide,\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0027Till the storm of life is past;\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Safe into the haven guide.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Oh, receive my soul at last.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e and the song rose and swelled out and up toward heaven, and stole away off to the horizon till the whole vast universe seemed filled with the sacred melody. As the last words and their music faded out in space. Shorty lunged down beside Si.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Say, Pard,\" he began banteringly, \"you\u0027ve missed yer callin\u0027. Op\u0027ry oughter have been yer trade.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, chop off yer chin music for a minute. Shorty,\" broke in Si. \"In the dark here it seemed most as though I was at home in the little old church with Maria and Annabel and Pap and Mother, and us all singing together, and you\u0027ve busted it—ah! listen!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e From not far away a bugler had tuned up and through the fragrant night came piercingly sweet—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"I will sing you a song of that beautiful land—\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then near at hand a strong, clear, musical tenor voice took up the second line,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"The far away home of the soul,\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e and almost instantly a deep, resonant bass voice boomed in—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Where no storms ever beat on that glittering strand\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; While the years of eternity roll,\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e and soon a hundred voices were making melody of the spheres as they sang Philip Phillips\u0027s beautiful song.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That was Wilse Hornbeck singin\u0027 tenor,\" said Si, as the song ended.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And it was Hen Withers doin\u0027 the bass stunt,\" returned Shorty.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You just oughter hear him do the ornamental on a mule whacker.

It was new to the boys then, but the bugler had heard it, and as Hen\u0027s magnificent voice rolled forth its fervid words the bugle caught up the high note theme, and never did the stars sing together more entrancingly than did the \"wicked mule whacker\" and that bugle—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Lift up your eyes, desponding freemen.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Fling to the winds your needless fears.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; He who unfurled our beauteous banner\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Says it shall wave a thousand years.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On the glorious chorus a thousand voices took up the refrain in droning fashion that made one think of \"The Sound of the Great Amen.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"A thousand years, my own Columbia!\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Tis the glad day so long foretold!\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0027Tis the glad mom whose early twilight\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Washington saw in times of old.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e By the time Hen had sung all of the seven verses the whole brigade knew the refrain and roared it forth as a defiance to the Southern Confederacy, which took on physical vigor in the days that came after, when the 200th Ind. went into battle to come off victorious on many a fiercely contested field.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then the tenor sang that doleful, woe begone, hope effacing, heart-string-cracking \"Lorena.\" Some writer has said that it sung the heart right out of the Southern Confederacy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"The sun\u0027s low down the sky, Lorena,\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; The snow is on the grass again.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As Wilse Hornbeck let his splendid voice out on the mournful cadences, Si felt his very heart strings snap, and even Shorty drew his breath hard, while some of the men simply rolled over, and burying their faces in their arms, sobbed audibly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Wilse had not counted on losing his own nerve, but found his voice breaking on the melancholy last lines, and bounding to his feet with a petulant,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Oh, hang it!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Say, darkies, hab you seen de Massa\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e came dancing up from the jubilating chords of that wonderful human music box, and soon the camp was reeling giddily with the jolly, rollicking,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Or Massa ran, ha! ha!!\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; The darkies stay, ho! ho!!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then, far in the distance a bugle sounded \"lights out,\" and the songfest was at an end; as bugler after bugler took it up, one by one the campfires bAlinked out, and squad after squad sank into quiet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I feel a heap better somehow,\" remarked Si, as he crawled under his blanket.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Dogged if I hain\u0027t had a sort of uplift, too,\" muttered Shorty, as he wrapped his blanket round his head.
