He even got hold of a gluttony imprint! It could be said that he had reaped huge rewards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe even obtained the research notes and experimental data from the acolyte, Blu. Those used to belong to Blu’s Morning Star ancestor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn return, a few spiritual force potions were sufficient to make the other party shed tears of gratitude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe research and insights of that Morning Star Magus inspired Leylin greatly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he hurried off, Leylin did not forget to command the A.I. Chip to record all of this information and enrich his database.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter settling the matters regarding the Spirit Wave and Beelzebub, Leylin boarded the private airship gifted by the Fallor Family— the Colossal Serpent. It was about time for the appointment he had arranged previously, thus he decided to abandon his more leisurely mode of transport.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs it was an airship custom-made for a Morning Star Magus, the Colossal Serpent had a comprehensive list of functions. The slightest tremor would not be felt even if it were to be caught in a thunderstorm. At the same time, all the flight paths and supply points across the central continent were open to the Colossal Serpent, and provided free maintenance services. This caused Leylin to be more impressed by the Fallor Family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, this might also have been the actual intention of the Fallor Family and the Monarch of the Skies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though it was an industry under the control of a Breaking Dawn Magus, it still dominated the air freight business across the entirety of the central continent, and had to spend their money somewhere else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs compared to trading in various aspects, this amount spent on currying favour with a Morning Star Magus was nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Colossal Serpent travelled at high speeds. At full speed, it only took Leylin less than half a month to arrive at his destination— Creevey Highlands!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis area was jointly protected by numerous Bloodline organisations, and was equivalent to a meeting point that was specially open to all Warlocks. It housed many hybrid races, Warlocks and those whose bloodlines had been contaminated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRumour had it that as long as one had the bloodline of a Warlock, or had any associations with bloodlines, they would be taken good care of here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThus, in the central continent where the Magi oppressed numerous races and the humans thrived, Creevey Highlands was like a paradise for those of the other races and mixed bloods who were cast out by both sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA private exchange would be held between Morning Star Warlocks in Creevey City, the biggest city in the heart of Creevey Highlands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul and Philip had also tried their best to invite Leylin here to interact more with the other high-ranking Warlocks. This, of course, was naturally what he wanted, and he’d immediately agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he didn’t want to attract too much attention, Leylin did not head towards the airship berth next to Creevey City, and instead, landed in the countryside. He put the Colossal Serpent aside and proceeded to Creevey City by foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe road was bustling with activity—carriages, gold-smelted vehicles, enchanted flying carpets and other means of transport. Numerous Magi from all walks of life formed a vast stream of people who came and left through the main gate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a characteristic that most of these Magi shared, and that was the immense saturation of their bloodline aura. Regardless of whether they were Warlocks or people from other races, or even those whose bloodlines were contaminated, none of them were discriminated against like they would have been in the outside world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon passing through the city gates, Leylin intentionally scanned the guard at the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was of a humanoid race, and stood at two metres tall. He had a long dog-like nose and ears, but otherwise, the rest of his body apart from his head was similar to a normal human being’s, just with more fur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A Canine Militant?!’ Leylin immediately thought of the Kobold’s close relative. While the Kobold was rumoured to share the same lineage as the ancient giant dragon, the Canine Militant was certainly a species of bestial humans. However, the people of the central continent widely classified them as close relatives, or even considered them as belonging to the same race as Kobolds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving purified the bloodline of the ancient red dragon before, Leylin understood clearly that the Kobold really did share the same lineage as the dragon race! Yet he didn’t feel any dragon bloodline aura exuding from these Canine Militants at all, not even the slightest bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘If I write a paper with this as the thesis, perhaps my name will be made known across the entire continent, although it won’t bring me any benefits…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin’s mind wandered off, but he immediately trashed this idea that would only bring him endless trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“However, the average strength of these Canine Militants is actually similar to that of the Kobolds. On top of that, they share similar appearances, no wonder the people of the central continent confuse the two!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSensing that these Canine Militants had the average strength of a rank 1 Magus, Leylin couldn’t help but regard highly the strength of the Warlocks in control of this city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndividually, they had outstanding levels of strength, and furthermore, they possessed remarkable tracking and scouting abilities. Just these Canine Militant guards alone were enough to intimidate unlawful people who were waiting for a chance to cause chaos.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Welcome to Creevey City! This is a Warlock city, please abide by the bloodline rules and respect the other races. Please choose the district you wish to proceed towards from the following: Lava Terrains, Great Woods, Heart of the Ocean, Tomb of Darkness, Central Core…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon entering the city, a prompt sounded in Leylin’s ear. Five huge teleportation formations surfaced in front of him, taking in large amounts of people as rays of light flashed periodically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entirety of Creevey City had been divided into five major districts, according to the four creational elements: earth, fire, wind and water. They were split according to the concentration of the elemental particles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong them, the Lava Terrains was a blazing district made up of a large amount of magma and soil. The concentration of its earth and fire elemental particles was almost at its maximum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Great Woods was actually a humongous ancient tree. All sorts of Magus buildings were constructed on its leaves, where many Magi lived. The wind and plant elemental particles were the highest here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Heart of the Ocean was a gigantic building complex that floated on water, surrounded by vast seas and sandy beaches, exuding strong tropical vibes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the Tomb of Darkness, it was where the darkness elemental particles were present in the highest concentration, and was also the place where one’s aura was the most suppressed. As there were many Warlocks who chose darkness, this location still occupied a firm spot in the city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf one looked from a bird’s eye view, he would be able to see that the entire city had a golden central district at its core, the rest of the town being equally divided into four parts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe azure blue sea, the fiery red magma, the lush green of the giant tree, and the darkness with all things wilting; these four districts each presented rich colours, yet were distinctly separate. Dazzling and uniformly distributed, none of the colours bled into the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe central district at the heart of it all was naturally the place where the interaction between these four districts took place, and also where the public facilities were located.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere, the enormous yet complicated geographical landscapes were forcibly mashed together by the power of the Magi, forming a marvel that was a rare sight in nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘In order to balance such a huge wave of elemental particles, and maintain the stability of the environment…’ A blue glow flickered continuously in Leylin’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘At the very least, it requires setting up a gigantic spell formation under the entire city. The sheer number of magic crystals spent on just operating and maintaining it alone would amount to an astronomical figure…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeylin gained a deeper understanding of the strength of these high-ranking Warlocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlancing at the people around him choosing which district to be teleported to, Leylin tilted his head in thought. He decided not to head towards the central core and the Tomb of Darkness, but instead walked into a turquoise teleportation spell formation, being transported to the Great Woods along with other Magi.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRays of light flashed, indicative of the teleportation process. Leylin no longer felt uncomfortable when experiencing spatial changes during such a short journey. After all, his current body was now able to withstand teleportation across different planes through the Astral Gate; this was like peanuts to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the other Magi were still feeling giddy from the residual effects of teleportation, Leylin had already walked out with both hands behind his back, and started sizing up the Great Woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place they had been transported to was evidently a crossroad. When Leylin arrived outside the teleportation spell formation, the first sights he saw were the humongous leaves and numerous Magi structures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked to the edge of the path before realising that the wide road he was walking on was actually just a twig of the giant tree. Sunlight shone through the gaps between the leaves, casting mottled shadows on the earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the crown of the tree was too large, the rays of light were very dim. One could see the glow of numerous Eternal Light spells and eternal flames in front of the Magus structures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whew…” The Great Woods could just be the highest place in the whole of Creevey City. Perched on the giant tree, one had a panoramic view of the other districts. Leylin took in the sights of the fiery magma, the sky blue seawater, and even the huge gloomy tomb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only the central core district that was shrouded in a layer of haze, and it couldn’t be seen clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Indeed, that area is an important strategical location, controls must be put in place!’ Leylin thought as he wandered along a branch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the Magus structures in the Great Woods were built on tree leaves, and were evenly distributed all the way to the top. If any Magus wanted to cover the entire district completely, he would have to scale the tree endlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the way, a few yellow and green and birds flew past Leylin from time to time, occasionally resting on high twigs and tweeting, which was pleasant to the ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the effect of the gigantic purification towers, even normal creatures could withstand the radiation contamination unintentionally emitted by Magi, as long as it was not too much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHence, average humans and other animals were able to exist in many Magus cities across the central continent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Such an environment seems to be what the Elves would like best!” Leylin couldn\u0027t help but check out the passers-by on both sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Creevey City, most of the population was made of Warlocks and other races. However, in the Great Woods district, the most commonly seen race was the Elves, who had pointy ears and tall and slender figures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne had to admit that the appearance of the Elves possessed many special characteristics unique to Warlocks. If not for the difference in their aura, and the ears which gave them away, many Magi would likely mistake Elves for Warlocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-517\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-519\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-518","bookId":1513,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:41:21 AM"}
