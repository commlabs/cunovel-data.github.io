Clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of her feared the sun might bring to light the grisly pale pink of mingled blood. But however much her ribs might feel like ragged blades in her chest, she knew there was no way anything was broken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wouldn\u0027t be able to ride, or even move, if somethin g had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wiped her palm on her dress, her movements slow and deliberate. In that moment, a torn something seemed no less painful to her than a broken something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of their voices gradually reemerged from the trees, coalescing into coherent snippets of conversation. Though at first their whispers had been a dense and rapidly flowing Gaelic, MacColla and Jean spoke increasingly in English.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t begin to guess who these people were or what it could mean that they spoke perfect Gaelic. Their English threw her too. It was thick and strangely accented, like no Scottish brogue she\u0027d ever heard. Islanders, perhaps?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust more confusing items to add to her growing list. She needed to figure out who the hell they were. At the very least, it might help her when she felt fit enough to make her escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley put her hand to her belly. Willing her diaphragm to rise, she breathed in as deeply as she could, nudging at the edges of her pain. Its acuteness had crested, dulling into something her body could reasonably handle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But who is she then?” he asked. “You can\u0027t be certain there wasn\u0027t another prisoner-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was the only one, Alasdair.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBickering lovers? Haley mused about the peculiar pair, wondering how a simpering girl could inspire the love of such a commanding force as this man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt another small twinge of jealousy. Where were all the suitors lining up to take care of Haley?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd where did a girl like that meet a man like him anyway? A helpless waif and a man calling himself Alasdair MacColla. Gooseflesh pebbled her skin. Why that name?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd why had they taken her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley retraced her steps. She\u0027d been contemplating a gun she\u0027d suspected had belonged to James Graham. It was a far-fetched theory, but she couldn\u0027t deny the certainty she felt in her gut. She\u0027d discovered a weapon that could rock history as everyone knew it. Something that would prove Graham didn\u0027t really die when the history books said he did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then she gets abducted by a man claiming the name of none other than Graham \u0027s famous compatriot, the warrior\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlasdair MacColla.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot likely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two events had to be linked somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rival academic? Who else would speak such perfect Gaelic? She couldn\u0027t tamp down a shiver of excitement, thinking that this MacColla\u0027s interest only corroborated her theory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSensing him near, Haley turned, and was taken aback at his closeness. She mustered as great a dare in her gaze as she could, despite needing to tilt her chin up to meet his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was handsome in the light, and it was off-putting. It\u0027d been easy to imagine him as some mangy beast in the dark, with his soiled kilt and wild hair. The caricature had made him easy to size up, easy to place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the day had brought to light strong features. Large, brown eyes. A wide mouth. A rugged, square jaw. His thick, dark eyebrows exaggerated a high forehead. Wild hair hung loose from either side of a ragged part, coming to rest on wide shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked so… big. The rough weave of his shirt strained over biceps and shoulders, doing nothing to conceal the solid wall of muscle beneath. Heat surged to her cheeks, and Haley hated the traitorous and irrational response to such a conspicuous show of maleness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo spite her own response, she forced an indifference she didn\u0027t feel, and allowed her eyes to rove the rest of him, taking in his tremendous brawn, the barrel chest and thickly knotted calves that emerged from his kilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRival academic? Yeah, right. Talk about a crazy professor type.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you really need to dress up like Alasdair MacColla?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe eyed his tartan. The muted dark greens, blues, and black had seen better days. It appeared he took a left turn at the seventeenth century and didn\u0027t look back. “Don\u0027t tell me. You\u0027re a student at Brown, aren\u0027t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacColla stared blankly. “You\u0027re a wee daftie of a lass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, I give up.” She could play along with the crazy reenactor guy. He clearly spent his weekends tossing cabers and eating venison he\u0027d skinned with his own hands. Talk about taking his scholarship seriously. “Why a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacColla costume? I mean, everyone knows James Graham was the one you\u0027d want to dress up as. He was the great hero.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man bristled, so she just bit back a grin and went with it. “But you, you were just kind of a sidekick, right? Graham was the handsome, smart one. Weren\u0027t you more of the brawn- not-brains variety? Although” - she scanned her eyes up and down his body - ”you do have the right look. You\u0027ve got kind of a big-lug thing going on. I can\u0027t see you in the fancy velvet waistcoats.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe met his gaze again and something looking like satisfaction played on his features. He couldn\u0027t possibly think she was checking him out, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“ Whatever, Mister Alasdair MacColla.” She rolled her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why don\u0027t you just tell me where you\u0027re taking me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mind whirred. She needed to figure out what was going on. He had to be another Celtic scholar, but what was he playing at? “Come on, tell me. What\u0027s your dissertation on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d surely seen the gun. She\u0027d put money on it. “Look, if this is about the gun, we can claim the find together. Just let me go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes narrowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s it. He\u0027d seen the gun, dated it, realized it belonged to Graham, and, putting two and two together, had decided to scare her out of the equation. Anyone who\u0027d take the name of such a famous - and famously brutal - hero of old had to be all kinds of crazy with his obsessions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley rubbed her side, playing up her injury. “I think I need a doctor.” Maybe that would scare him into freeing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStanding completely still, he simply stared, scrutinizing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I won\u0027t let you have it.” she finally stated baldly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I take whatever I want, you wee hellcat.” He roved his eyes over her, giving his words a double meaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shiver ran up her spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was my discovery,” she replied quickly. “It\u0027s mine you know. The weapon is mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know you\u0027ve no weapon. Unless you\u0027ve hidden it.” Before she could dodge him, MacColla grabbed her close, reaching around and patting her on the rump to frisk her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let out a sharp squeal and watched as the light drained from MacColla\u0027s eyes. He abruptly let her go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Och.” A hiss of breath escaped him as he visibly gathered himself. “Stop with the games, lass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice grew stern. “Campbell is at our backs and I need to get Jean to safety.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glowered. This business about Campbell again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is Robert the Bruce after us too?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would that it were so,” he countered with a sudden laugh. “Now, if I have the right of it, Jean\u0027s safety is your safety. So if you\u0027ve a mind to your own hide, you\u0027ll get back up on that pony and ride.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared, speechless. She was going to get the hell away from them as soon as she could, of that she had no doubt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRide. The thought of more riding filled her with a dread so vast it felt like a physical weight in her belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe must\u0027ve made some face, because he let out a low chuckle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Haley could give him what for, MacColla surprised her by asking, “What\u0027s your name, lass?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was the one who\u0027d taken her - wouldn\u0027t he know that already?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Haley… ” she hesitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see your pain, Haley.” His tone was unnervingly gentle, his voice slowing to pronounce her name with care. “You need your wind back. If you\u0027re to ride anymore this day, we\u0027ll need to bind you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But didn\u0027t you just say we had to get out of here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aye.” he smiled and cocked a brow, “I ken what I said. \u0027Twill take but a moment. I\u0027ve no doctor at my disposal, but I myself have bound many a man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027ll just bet you have,” she said under her breath, and he surprised her once more with a laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But,” he added gravely, “I \u0027ll have your word you\u0027ll not try to claw me while I do so, my wee caile bhorb.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe peculiar nickname caught her off guard. A wee what girl? Fierce?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA wry smile cocked her lips before she could give it a thought. Her, a wee savage. A wisp of a laugh esc aped her nostrils. Wouldn\u0027t her brothers have loved that one?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I won\u0027t claw you,” she said grudgingly, thinking what a relief it would be to have her ribs bound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkeptical, he raised his brows, questioning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have my word.” She was growing impatient with these suddenly amiable efforts. Who did he think he was to kidnap her, then think to bust out the burly charms? “Just get on with it, okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her quizzically. Just when she thought he didn\u0027t understand what she said, the man unsheathed his dirk and, biting it between his teeth, proceeded to unbuckle, take off his belt, loosen his tartan, and drop the entire heavy swath of wool into a puddle on the ground. All he wore was an enormous shirt that reached to the middle of his thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the ”-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was approaching midafternoon now, and it cut across the valley at MacColla\u0027s back. The sharp angle lit him from behind, making the thin linen of his shirt glow with light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt also made it see - through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaley gasped, seeing the size of him through the gauzy stretch of fabric. She turned away quickly, feeling her cheeks blaze red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe told herself she\u0027d seen a naked man before. Her first-year college boyfriend, to be precise. And it certainly hadn\u0027t been cause for any fireworks. If there was no magic to be had then, why should she shy away from the sight now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMisunderstanding her uneasiness, he took the blade from his mouth and explained. “I\u0027ll need something to bind you, aye? Or were you of a mind to shred your own frock into ribbons?” Sticking the knife back between bared teeth, he unfurled the yards and yards of dingy plaid wool. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/warrior-of-the-highlands-highlands-3/page-10.html","bookId":1617,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:07:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:07:03 PM"}
