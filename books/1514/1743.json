The savage aura gushing out from their bodies let everyone understood just how vicious they were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach one of these Demonic Beasts is able to rival a half-step-to Nirvana stage practitioner!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the moment, even Lin Dong’s pupils violently shrunk. As he was too far away, he could not tell how many half-step-to Nirvana stage Demonic Beasts were present. At the very least, based on the ones that he could see, he knew that they were powerful enough to rip apart all the campsites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment, he finally understood why the demonic horde is considered as a catastrophe in the ancient battlefield. In front of such a massive force, even a genuine Nirvana stage practitioner did not dare to clash against it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWu! Wu!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn extremely sharp and piercing warning siren echoed out in the entire mountain range and everyone felt as if their hearts were being squeezed by a invisible large hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Boom!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs that warning siren echoed out, those half-step-to Nirvana stage Demonic Beasts released a series of deafening roars. Promptly, their speed increased before they spread themselves out and headed towards different campsites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Lin Dong saw this sight, his eyes shrunk. He could see that there were a total of four half-step-to Nirvana stage Demonic Beasts charging towards them. It seems like these fellow are pretty intelligent and they detected that there were four tough opponents at their campsite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tang Xuan, Liu Xuan, Lin Dong, the four of us will combine forces and each of us will take on one Demonic Beast. We must not let them overrun our campsite!” When he saw those four half-step-to Nirvana stage Demonic Beasts charging towards them, Mo Tei suddenly shouted. At this juncture, if their campsite was overrun, everyone within will be instantly swept away by the demonic horde.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, the only ones here who could fight against those four Demonic Beasts were the four of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, just as Mo Tei shouted, those four incoming half-step-to Nirvana stage Demonic Beasts had already split up. Then, they each charged towards Mo Tei and the rest respectively\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stupid beast, this old man wants to find out just how powerful you are!” Mo Tei was so agitated by those blood-red eyeballs till his breathing turned ragged. Following which, he suddenly swung the black large sabre in his hand, before a venomous blade shadow gushed out. With a loud roar, his body suddenly dashed forth, while the blade shadows in his hand was just like glowing screens as they rained down on that Demonic Beast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Mo Tei made his move, Tang Xuan duo also dashed forth as they pushed all the Yuan Power in their bodies to their limits. Then, they unleashed various powerful martial arts before they managed to forcefully hold down those half-step-to Nirvana stage Demonic Beasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they saw that the three powerful Demonic Beasts had been held down, everyone in the campsite heaved a sigh of relief. Promptly, all of them nervously turned to the southern side, before they saw a hideous-looking Demonic Beast, filled with a rich killing aura, dashing towards them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone here is keenly aware of Mo Tei and the Tang Xuan duo’s strength. Even during nightfall, when their Yuan Power is being constrained, they should be able to handle a half-step-to Nirvana stage Demonic Beast. Therefore, everyone’s attention was now turned towards the southern side. That was because Lin Dong was in charge of guarding that spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though Lin Dong had previously showcased his strength, the Demonic Beast heading towards him was an existence that could rival a half-step-to Nirvana stage practitioner. Furthermore, regardless of which side collapsed, their campsite would be flooded by Demonic Beasts. Therefore, Lin Dong’ southern side was equally crucial!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the crowd watched nervously, Lin Dong remained calm. As he gripped on the bone spear in his palm, his lean figure gave off an indescribable yet majestic aura.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong stared right at that powerful incoming Demonic Beast, while he slowly tightened his grip on the bone spear. Meanwhile, a tiny golden glow stealthily flowed beneath his skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Boom!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile that golden glow flowed, a sharp glint immediately flashed across Lin Dong’s eyes. Just like a sharp blade that had been unsheathed, his body flew forth. Then, under the bewildered stares from the crowd, he gallantly clashed against that half-step-to Nirvana stage Demonic Beast!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Growl! Growl!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat half-step-to Nirvana stage Demonic Beast clenched its claws into a fist. Following which, with a formidable force, that was powerful enough to obliterate mountains, it directly punched at Lin Dong. Faintly, one could discern some martial art moves contained in its attack. It seems like this Demonic Beast is fairly intelligent. In addition to its god-given strength, coupled with its martial art moves, it is able to propel its strength till a truly terrifying extent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Swoosh! Swoosh!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, as he faced that half-step-to Nirvana stage Demonic Beast’s powerful attack, Lin Dong’s feet executed Supreme Purity Sky Wanderer Steps before his body transformed into a wisp of green smoke and easily dodged that attack. Promptly, his expression turned icy cold.Then, the Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear in his hand transformed into an extremely sharp spear shadow, before he lightning-quick jabbed that Demonic Beast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuzz! La!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat Demonic Beast had extremely powerful defences and even a half-step-to Nirvana stage practitioner’s attack could do little damage to it. However, the Heavenly Crocodile Bone Spear in Lin Dong’s hand was no ordinary Soul Treasure. In fact, it was sharp enough to penetrate through a half-step-to Nirvana stage practitioner’s defences. Therefore, when his spear brushed by, it directly left a deep and bloody wound on that Demonic Beast’s body. Instantly, fresh blood spurted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Growl!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the intense pain did not cause the Demonic Beast to retreat. Instead, it got increasingly agitated as it viciously slammed its claws against the ground. Instantly, countless mud pillars shot out and viciously flew towards Lin Dong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bang! Bang! Bang!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLin Dong’s body transformed into a wisp of green smoke, while several formidable spear shadows erupted from his hands and completely countered against those incoming mud pillars. Then, he jerked his spear, before he tangled with that Demonic Beasts again, causing powerful shockwaves to continuously erupt forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they saw that Lin Dong could actually match up against that half-step-to Nirvana stage Demonic Beast, everyone in the campsite heaved a sigh of relief. Right now, none of them dared to look down at him anymore. After all, the facts laid bare in front of them and they finally believed that Lin Dong had the ability to match up to a half-step-to Nirvana stage practitioner!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMo Tei and the Tang Xuan duo were fairly concerned about his situation as well. After all, they were all on the same boat and if Lin Dong’s side was breached, they would be overrun by the demonic horde as well. Therefore, when they saw that Lin Dong had actually managed to stop the half-step-to Nirvana stage Demonic Beast, they solemnly heaved a sigh of relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, this area in the mountain range was filled with fights and a bloody stench. Every campsite was surrounded by tons of Demonic Beasts. However, even though the demonic horde was massive, everyone here was no pushover and they also possessed strength and good teamwork. Therefore, after stumbling initially, they managed to slowly push back against the demonic horde. In fact, those half-step-to Nirvana stage Demonic Beasts were all held down by the half-step-to Nirvana stage practitioner in the respective campsite, thereby preventing them from causing additional damage to their campsite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this rate, as long as they can endure till daybreak, they can successfully hold off this demonic horde!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Boom!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the southern side of the campsite, a large and small figure violently clashed, before a savage shockwind swept forth and caused some unlucky Demonic Beast nearby to be blown apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the campsite, several people stared in awe at Lin Dong, who was actually fighting against a half-step-to Nirvana stage Demonic Beast. In fact, when they saw that Lin Dong did not lose out at all, the awe in their eyes intensified. After all, during nightfall, even Mo Tei and the rest could only hold down the Demonic Beast and this was considered a fairly reputable result for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, this was not the result that Lin Dong desired. After fighting for so long against that half-step-to Nirvana stage Demonic Beast, he naturally knew a bit about the latter’s strength and weakness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Saint Elephant Sky Crumbling Tackle!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, after he was blown apart, a deep roar suddenly echoed out. Then, the crowd immediately saw a large glowing elephant suddenly appear. Following which, with a powerful shockwave that could destroy the world, it viciously slammed against that half-step-to Nirvana stage Demonic Beast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Boom!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire earth seemed to have trembled at that moment. Then, under the bewildered stares from the crowd, that large Demonic Beast’s body flew out before it even squashed some unlucky Demonic Beasts along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Swoosh!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe instant that Demonic Beast flew out, a figure once again flashed across the horizon before it appeared quickly in front of that Demonic Beast. Then, a sharp bone spear instantly swelled up, before it carried a sharp aura and pierced through that hideous Demonic Beast’s scalp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA painful scream ricocheted across mid-air, and caused one’s hair to stand. However, this scream not only attracted the attention from his campsite, but drew the attention of other campsites as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen those people saw the Demonic Beast that had been killed by Lin Dong’s bone spear, a thick awe flowed in their eyes. During the night, even a half-step-to Nirvana stage practitioner can only hope to hold down these powerful Demonic Beasts and most ordinary half-step-to Nirvana stage practitioner would not be able to kill them. However… Lin Dong was actually the first one to kill a half-step-to Nirvana stage Demonic Beast!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they saw this sight, Tang Xuan and Liu Xuan, who were still tangling with the Demonic Beast, trembled. When they recalled their initial attitude towards Lin Dong, a tinge of self-mockery involuntarily flashed in their hearts. Meanwhile, any trace of disdain in their hearts had completely disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-431\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-433\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/wu-dong-qian-kun/wdqk-chapter-432","bookId":1514,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:56 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 7:28:56 AM"}
