What bullshit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerry puts his arm around her and I\u0027m tempted to pick a fight in the middle of the gallery. \"I can tell you\u0027re very deep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep, my ass. He wants to get into her pants . . . pants he\u0027s never going near if I have anything to say about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex, what do you think?\" Brittany asks, turning to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well ...\" I rub my chin as I stare at the painting. \"I think the entire collection is worth a buck fifty, two tops.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSierra\u0027s eyes go wide and her hand covers her mouth in shock. Doug is coughing up his drink. And Brittany? I look at my \"let\u0027s see what happens\" girlfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex, you owe Perry an apology,\" Brittany says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, right after he apologizes for asking me about wasabi. Not a chance in hell. \"I\u0027m outta here,\" I say, then turn my back on all of them and walk out the gallery door. Me voy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, I bum a cigarette from a waitress across the street who\u0027s on break. All I can think about is how Brittany looked as she ordered me to apologize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI do not take orders well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn, I hated watching that asshole artist put his arm around my girl. I\u0027m sure every guy wants to put his hands on her in some way, to claim they\u0027ve touched her. I want to touch her, too, but I also want her to want only me. Not order me around like some puppy dog and only hold hands with me when she\u0027s not putting on a show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is definitely not turning out like it\u0027s supposed to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw you come out of the gallery. Only hoiteys go in there,\" the waitress says after I hand back her lighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWasabi. Now hoiteys. Seriously, you\u0027d think I really didn\u0027t know English. \"Hoiteys?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hoitey-toitey types. You know, white-collar stiffs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, I\u0027m definitely not one of those. More like a blue collar who followed a bunch of hoiteys in there.\" I take a long drag, thankful for nicotine. I feel calmer immediately. Okay, so my lungs are probably shriveled up, but I have a good idea I\u0027ll probably die before my lungs decide to quit on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Blue-Collar Mandy,\" the waitress says, holding out her hand and flashing me a smile. She\u0027s got light brown hair streaked with purple. She\u0027s cute, but she\u0027s no Brittany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake her hand. \"Alex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe eyes my tattoos. \"I\u0027ve got two. Wanna see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot really. I have a feeling she got drunk one night and tattooed her chest... or ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex!\" Brittany yells my name from the front of the gallery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m still smoking and trying to forget that she brought me here because I\u0027m her dirty little secret. I don\u0027t want to be a fucking secret anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy pseudo-girlfriend crosses the street. Her designer shoes click on the pavement, reminding me she\u0027s a class above. She eyes Mandy and me, the two blue collars, smoking together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mandy here was about to show me her tattoos,\" I tell Brittany to piss her off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bet she was. Were you going to show her yours, too?\" She eyes me accusingly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not into drama,\" Mandy says. She throws down her cigarette and smashes it with the tip of her gym shoe. \"Good luck, you two. God knows you need it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take another drag while wishing Brittany didn\u0027t tempt me like she does. \"Go back to the gallery, querida. I\u0027ll take a bus home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought we\u0027d have a nice day together, Alex, in a town where nobody knows us. Don\u0027t you want to be anonymous sometimes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think it\u0027s nice havin\u0027 that little piece of shit artist thinkin\u0027 I\u0027m the busboy? I\u0027d rather be known as the gangbanger than the immigrant busboy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t even give it a chance. If you\u0027d relax and take that chip off your shoulder, you could fit in. You can be one of them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone is plastic in there. Even you. Wake up, Miss Omigod! I don\u0027t want to be one of them. Get it? !Entiendes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Loud and clear. For your information, I am not plastic. You can call it that, but we call it considerate and polite.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In your social circles, not mine. In my circles, we tell it like it is. And never, ever order me to apologize like you\u0027re my mother. I swear, Brittany, the next time you do that we\u0027re done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, man. Her eyes are getting all glassy. She turns her back to me and I want to kick myself for hurting her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put out my cigarette. \"I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to be a dickhead. Well, I did. But that\u0027s \u0027cause I didn\u0027t feel comfortable in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s not looking at me. Reaching out to rub her back, I\u0027m thankful she doesn\u0027t shy away from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI continue talking. \"Brittany, I love hangin\u0027 with you. Shit, when I get to school I scan the halls lookin\u0027 for you. As soon as I catch sight of these angelic streaks of sunshine,\" I say, fingering her hair, \"I know I can make it through the day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m no angel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are to me. If you forgive me, I\u0027ll go back and apologize to that artist guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opens her eyes. \"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I don\u0027t want to do it. But I will ... for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mouth curves into a small smile. \"Don\u0027t do it. I appreciate you saying you\u0027ll do it for me, but you\u0027re right. His art did suck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you guys are,\" Sierra says. \"We\u0027ve been looking all over for you lovebirds. Let\u0027s hit the road and get to the cabin already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the cabin, Doug claps his hands together. \"Hot tub or movie?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSierra walks over to the window overlooking the lake. \"I\u0027ll fall asleep if we put a movie on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m sitting with Brittany on the couch in the living room, reeling over the fact that this huge house is Doug\u0027s second home. It\u0027s bigger than the one house I live in. And a hot tub? Jeez, rich people have it all. \"I don\u0027t have a bathin\u0027 suit,\" I tell them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry,\" Brittany says. \"Doug probably has one in the pool house you can wear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the pool house, Doug looks through a drawer searching for suits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s only two here.\" Doug picks up a skimpy Speedo and holds it out to me. \"This okay for you, big guy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That wouldn\u0027t fit my right testicle. Why don\u0027t you wear it and I\u0027ll take this one,\" I say, reaching around Doug and grabbing a boxer-type suit. I notice the girls are gone. \"Where\u0027d they go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To change. And to talk about us, I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the small changing room as I strip and get into the suit, I think about my life back home. Here, in Lake Geneva, it\u0027s easy to forget about home life for a while. Not having to worry about who\u0027s got my back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I step out of the changing room, Doug says, \"She\u0027ll take a lot of shit by being with you, you know. People are already starting to talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, Douggie. I like that girl more than I can remember likin\u0027 anything in my life. I\u0027m not about to give her up. I\u0027ll start carin\u0027 about what other people think when I\u0027m six feet under.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoug smiles and holds out his arms. \"Ah, Fuentes, I think we just had a male bonding moment. Wanna hug?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not on your life, white boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoug slaps me on the back, then we walk to the hot tub. Despite everything, I think we do have, if not a bonding, then at least an understanding. Either way, I\u0027m still not hugging him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very sexy, babe,\" Sierra says, eyeing Doug\u0027s Speedo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoug is walking like a penguin, waddling while trying to get comfortable. \"I swear to God I\u0027m taking these off as soon as I get in the hot tub. They\u0027re choking my balls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"TMI,\" Brittany chimes in, covering her ears with her palms. She\u0027s wearing a yellow bikini, leaving very little to the imagination. Does she realize she looks like a sunflower, ready to rain sunshine on all who look down upon her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoug and Sierra climb into the tub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hop into the tub and sit beside Brittany. I\u0027ve never been in a hot tub before, and am not sure about hot-tub protocol. Are we going to sit here and talk, or do we break off into couples and make out? I like the second option, but Brittany looks nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEspecially when Doug tosses his Speedo out of the tub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wince. \"Come on, man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? I want to be able to have kids one day, Fuentes. That thing was cutting off my circulation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrittany hops out of the tub and pulls a towel around her. \"Let\u0027s go inside, Alex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You guys can stay in here,\" Sierra says. \"I\u0027ll make him put the marble bag back on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forget it. You two enjoy the tub. We\u0027ll be inside,\" Brittany says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I\u0027m out of the tub, Brittany hands me an extra towel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my arm around her as we walk to the cabin. \"You okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely. I was thinking you were upset.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m cool. But. . .\" Inside, I pick up a blown-glass figurine and study it. \"Seein\u0027 this house, this life ... I want to be here with you, but I look around and realize this will never be me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re thinking too much.\" She kneels on the carpet and pats the floor. \"Come here and lie on your stomach. I know how to give Swedish massages. It\u0027ll relax you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not Swedish,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, well, neither are you. So if I do it wrong you\u0027ll never know the difference.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lie next to her. \"I thought we were gonna take this relationship slow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A back rub is harmless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes roam over her kick-ass bikini-covered bod. \"I\u0027ll have you know I\u0027ve been intimate with girls wearin\u0027 a lot more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slaps me on the butt. \"Behave yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her hands move over my back, I let out a groan. Man, this is torture. I\u0027m trying to behave, but her hands feel too damn good and my body has a mind of its own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re tense,\" she says in my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course I\u0027m tense. Her hands are all over me. My answer is another groan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a few minutes of Brittany\u0027s mind-numbing massage, loud moaning, groaning, and grunting from the hot tub floats into the room. Doug and Sierra have obviously skipped the back rub portion of the evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think they\u0027re doing it?\" she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Either that, or Doug\u0027s a very religious guy,\" I say, referring to the guy screaming Oh, God! every two seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it make you horny?\" she sings quietly into my ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but you keep massagin\u0027 me like that and you can forget about that goin\u0027 slow bullshit.\" I sit up and face her. \"What I can\u0027t figure out is if you know you\u0027re a tease and are fuckin\u0027 with me or whether you really are innocent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not a tease.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cock an eyebrow, then look down at my upper thigh where she\u0027s parked her hand. She snatches it away. \"Okay, I didn\u0027t mean to put my hand there. Well, I mean, not really. It just kinda . . . wh . . . what I mean to say is--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like it when you stutter,\" I say as I pull her down next to me and show her my own version of a Swedish massage until we\u0027re interrupted by Sierra and Doug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo weeks later, I get word that I have a court date for my gun possession charge. I hide the info from Brittany, because she\u0027d freak out. She\u0027d probably go on and on about how a public defender isn\u0027t as good as a private lawyer. The thing is, I can\u0027t afford a fancy lawyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I\u0027m worrying about my fate while I\u0027m hanging by the front doors before school, I\u0027m suddenly sideswiped by someone and almost lose my balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell?\" I push back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry,\" the guy says nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realize the guy is none other than White Guy from the jail cell. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/perfect-chemistry-perfect-chemistry-1/page-34.html","bookId":2767,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:11:24 PM"}
