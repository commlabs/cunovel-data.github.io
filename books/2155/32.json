She saw that Farad\u0027n wore the dress grey of a Sardaukar commander without decorations. He moved with a lean grace which Alia admired. Perhaps there would be more than idle amusement in this Corrino Prince.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Preacher\u0027s voice boomed into the room over the amplifier pickups beside the window. Alia felt the tremors of it in her bones, began to listen to his words with growing fascination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found myself in the Desert of Zan,\" The Preacher shouted, \"in that waste of howling wilderness. And God commanded me to make that place clean. For we were provoked in the desert, and grieved in the desert, and we were tempted in that wilderness to forsake our ways.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesert of Zan, Alia thought. That was the name given to the place of the first trial of the Zensunni Wanderers from whom the Fremen sprang. But his words! Was he taking credit for the destruction wrought against the sietch strongholds of the loyal tribes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wild beasts lie upon your lands,\" The Preacher said, his voice booming across the plaza. \"Doleful creatures fill your houses. You who fled your homes no longer multiply your days upon the sand. Yea, you who have forsaken our ways, you will die in a fouled nest if you continue on this path. But if you heed my warning, the Lord shall lead you through a land of pits into the Mountains of God. Yea, Shai-Hulud shall lead you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoft moans arose from the crowd. The Preacher paused, swinging his eyeless sockets from side to side at the sound. Then he raised his arms, spreading them wide, called out: \"O God, my flesh longeth for Thy way in a dry and thirsty land!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn old woman in front of The Preacher, an obvious refugee by the patched and worn look of her garments, held up her hands to him, pleaded: \"Help us, Muad\u0027Dib. Help us!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a sudden fearful constriction of her breast, Alia asked herself if that old woman really knew the truth. Alia glanced at her mother, but Jessica remained unmoving, dividing her attention between Alia\u0027s guards, Farad\u0027n and the view from the window. Farad\u0027n stood rooted in fascinated attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia glanced out the window, trying to see her Temple Priests. They were not in view and she suspected they had worked their way around below her near the Temple doors, seeking a direct route down the steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Preacher pointed his right hand over the old woman\u0027s head, shouted: \"You are the only help remaining! You were rebellious. You brought the dry wind which does not cleanse, nor does it cool. You bear the burden of our desert, and the whirlwind cometh from that place, from that terrible land. I have been in that wilderness. Water runs upon the sand from shattered qanats. Streams cross the ground. Water has fallen from the sky in the Belt of Dune! O my friends, God has commanded me. Make straight in the desert a highway for our Lord, for I am the voice that cometh to thee from the wilderness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed to the steps beneath his feet, a stiff and quivering finger. \"This is no lost djedida which is no more inhabited forever! Here have we eaten the bread of heaven. And here the noise of strangers drives us from our homes! They breed for us a desolation, a land wherein no man dwelleth, nor any man pass thereby.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd stirred uncomfortably, refugees and town Fremen peering about, looking at the pilgrims of the Hajj who stood among them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could start a bloody riot! Alia thought. Well, let him. My Priests can grab him in the confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw the five Priests then, a tight knot of yellow robes working down the steps behind The Preacher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The waters which we spread upon the desert have become blood,\" The Preacher said, waving his arms wide. \"Blood upon our land! Behold our desert which could rejoice and blossom; it has lured the stranger and seduced him in our midst. They come for violence! Their faces are closed up as for the last wind of Kralizec! They gather the captivity of the sand. They suck up the abundance of the sand, the treasure hidden in the depths. Behold them as they go forth to their evil work. It is written: \u0027And I stood upon the sand, and I saw a beast rise up out of that sand, and upon the head of that beast was the name of God!\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAngry mutterings arose from the crowd. Fists were raised, shaken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is he doing?\" Farad\u0027n whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I knew,\" Alia said. She put a hand to her breast, feeling the fearful excitement of this moment. The crowd would turn upon the pilgrims if he kept this up!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut The Preacher half turned, aimed his dead sockets toward the Temple and raised a hand to point at the high windows of Alia\u0027s aerie, \"One blasphemy remains!\" he screamed. \"Blasphemy! And the name of that blasphemy is Alia!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShocked silence gripped the plaza.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia stood in unmoving consternation. She knew the mob could not see her, but she felt overcome by a sense of exposure, of vulnerability. The echoes of calming words within her skull competed with the pounding of her heart. She could only stare down at that incredible tableau. The Preacher remained with a hand pointing at her windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words had been too much for the Priests, though. They broke the silence with angry shouts, stormed down the steps, thrusting people aside. As they moved the crowd reacted, breaking like a wave upon the steps, sweeping over the first lines of onlookers, carrying The Preacher before them. He stumbled blindly, separated from his young guide. Then a yellow-clad arm arose from the press of people; a crysknife was brandished in its hand. She saw the knife strike downward, bury itself in The Preacher\u0027s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thunderous clang of the Temple\u0027s giant doors being closed broke Alia from her shock. Guards obviously had closed the doors against the mob. But people already were drawing back, making an open space around a crumpled figure on the steps. An eerie quiet fell over the plaza. Alia saw many bodies, but only this one lay by itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen a voice screeched from the mob: \"Muad\u0027Dib! They\u0027ve killed Muad\u0027Dib!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gods below,\" Alia quavered. \"Gods below.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A little late for that, don\u0027t you think?\" Jessica asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia whirled, noting the sudden startled reaction of Farad\u0027n as he saw the rage on her face. \"That was Paul they killed!\" Alia screamed. \"That was your son! When they confirm it, do you know what\u0027ll happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica stood rooted for a long moment, thinking that she had just been told something already known to her. Farad\u0027n\u0027s hand upon her arm shattered the moment. \"My Lady,\" he said, and there was such compassion in his voice that Jessica thought she might die of it right there. She looked from the cold, glaring anger on Alia\u0027s face to the sympathetic misery on Farad\u0027n\u0027s features, and thought: Perhaps I did my job too well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere could be no doubting Alia\u0027s words. Jessica remembered every intonation of The Preacher\u0027s voice, hearing her own tricks in it, the long years of instruction she\u0027d spent there upon a young man meant to be Emperor, but who now lay a shattered mound of bloody rags upon the Temple steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhafla blinded me, Jessica thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia gestured to one of her aides, called: \"Bring Ghanima now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica forced herself into recognizing these words. Ghanima? Why Ghanima now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aide had turned toward the outer door, motioning for it to be unbarred, but before a word could be uttered the door bulged. Hinges popped. The bar snapped and the door, a thick plasteel construction meant to withstand terrible energies, toppled into the room. Guards leaped to avoid it, drawing their weapons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica and Farad\u0027n\u0027s bodyguards closed in around the Corrino Prince.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the opening revealed only two children: Ghanima on the left, clad in her black betrothal robe, and Leto on the right, the grey slickness of a stillsuit beneath a desert-stained white robe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia stared from the fallen door to the children, found she was trembling uncontrollably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The family here to greet us,\" Leto said. \"Grandmother.\" He nodded to Jessica, shifted his attention to the Corrino Prince. \"And this must be Prince Farad\u0027n. Welcome to Arrakis, Prince.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhanima\u0027s eyes appeared empty. She held her right hand on a ceremonial crysknife at her waist, and she appeared to be trying to escape from Leto\u0027s grip on her arm. Leto shook her arm and her whole body shook with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Behold me, family,\" Leto said. \"I am Ari, the Lion of the Atreides. And here -\" Again he shook Ghanima\u0027s arm with that powerful ease which set her whole body jerking. \"- here is Aryeh, the Atreides Lioness. We come to set you onto Secher Nbiw, the Golden Path.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhanima, absorbing the trigger words, Secher Nbiw, felt the locked-away consciousness flow into her mind. It flowed with a linear nicety, the inner awareness of her mother hovering there behind it, a guardian at a gate. And Ghanima knew in that instant that she had conquered the clamorous past. She possessed a gate through which she could peer when she needed that past. The months of self-hypnotic suppression had built for her a safe place from which to manage her own flesh. She started to turn toward Leto with the need to explain this when she became aware of where she stood and with whom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto released her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did our plan work?\" Ghanima whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well enough,\" Leto said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecovering from her shock, Alia shouted at a clump of guards on her left: \"Seize them!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Leto bent, took the fallen door with one hand, skidded it across the room into the guards. Two were pinned against the wall. The others fell back in terror. That door weighed half a metric ton and this child had thrown it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia, growing aware that the corridor beyond the doorway contained fallen guards, realized that Leto must have dealt with them, that this child had shattered her impregnable door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica, too, had seen the bodies, seen the awesome power in Leto and had made similar assumptions, but Ghanima\u0027s words touched a core of Bene Gesserit discipline which forced Jessica to maintain her composure. This grandchild spoke of a plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What plan?\" Jessica asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Golden Path, our Imperial plan for our Imperium,\" Leto said. He nodded to Farad\u0027n. \"Don\u0027t think harshly of me, cousin. I act for you as well. Alia hoped to have Ghanima slay you. I\u0027d rather you lived out your life in some degree of happiness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia screamed at her guards cowering in the passage: \"I command you to seize them!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the guards refused to enter the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait for me here, sister,\" Leto said. \"I have a disagreeable task to perform.\" He moved across the room toward Alia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe backed away from him into a corner, crouched and drew her knife. The green jewels of its handle flashed in the light from the window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto merely continued his advance, hands empty, but spread and ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia lunged with the knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto leaped almost to the ceiling, struck with his left foot. It caught Alia\u0027s head a glancing blow and sent her sprawling with a bloody mark on her forehead. She lost her grip on the knife and it skidded across the floor. Alia scrambled after the knife, but found Leto standing in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia hesitated, called up everything she knew of Bene Gesserit training. She came off the floor, body loose and poised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce more Leto advanced upon her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia feinted to the left but her right shoulder came up and her right foot shot out in a toe-pointing kick which could disembowel a man if it struck precisely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto caught the blow on his arm, grabbed the foot, and picked her up by it, swinging her around his head. The speed with which he swung her sent a flapping, hissing sound through the room as her robe beat against her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe others ducked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia screamed and screamed, but still she continued to swing around and around and around. Presently she fell silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly Leto reduced the speed of her whirling, dropped her gently to the floor. She lay in a panting bundle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto bent over her. \"I could\u0027ve thrown you through a wall,\" he said. \"Perhaps that would\u0027ve been best, but we\u0027re now at the center of the struggle. You deserve your chance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia\u0027s eyes darted wildly from side to side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have conquered those inner lives,\" Leto said. \"Look at Ghani. She, too, can -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGhanima interrupted: \"Alia, I can show you -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" The word was wrenched from Alia. Her chest heaved and voices began to pour from her mouth. They were disconnected, cursing, pleading. \"You see! Why didn\u0027t you listen?\" And again: \"Why\u0027re you doing this? What\u0027s happening?\" And another voice: \"Stop them! Make them stop!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica covered her eyes, felt Farad\u0027n\u0027s hand steady her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill Alia raved: \"I\u0027ll kill you!\" Hideous curses erupted from her. \"I\u0027ll drink your blood!\" The sounds of many languages began to pour from her, all jumbled and confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe huddled guards in the outer passage made the sign of the worm, then held clenched fists beside their ears. She was possessed!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto stood, shaking his head. He stepped to the window and with three swift blows shattered the supposedly unbreakable crystal-reinforced glass from its frame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sly look came over Alia\u0027s face. Jessica heard something like her own voice come from that twisting mouth, a parody of Bene Gesserit control. \"All of you! Stay where you are!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica, lowering her hands, found them damp with tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlia rolled to her knees, lurched to her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you know who I am?\" she demanded. It was her old voice, the sweet and lilting voice of the youthful Alia who was no more. \"Why\u0027re you all looking at me that way?\" She turned pleading eyes to Jessica. \"Mother, make them stop it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica could only shake her head from side to side, consumed by ultimate horror. All of the old Bene Gesserit warnings were true. She looked at Leto and Ghani standing side by side near Alia. What did those warnings mean for these poor twins?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grandmother,\" Leto said, and there was pleading in his voice. \"Must we have a Trial of Possession?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who are you to speak of trial?\" Alia asked, and her voice was that of a querulous man, an autocratic and sensual man far gone in self-indulgence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Leto and Ghanima recognized the voice. The Old Baron Harkonnen. Ghanima heard the same voice begin to echo in her own head, but the inner gate closed and she sensed her mother standing there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica remained silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then the decision is mine,\" Leto said. \"And the choice is yours, Alia. Trial of Possession, or...\" He nodded toward the open window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027re you to give me a choice?\" Alia demanded, and it was still the voice of the Old Baron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Demon!\" Ghanima screamed. \"Let her make her own choice!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother,\" Alia pleaded in her little-girl tones. \"Mother, what\u0027re they doing? What do you want me to do? Help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help yourself,\" Leto ordered and, for just an instant, he saw the shattered presence of his aunt in her eyes, a glaring hopelessness which peered out at him and was gone. But her body moved, a sticklike, thrusting walk. She wavered, stumbled, veered from her path but returned to it, nearer and nearer the open window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the voice of the Old Baron raged from her lips: \"Stop! Stop it, I say! I command you! Stop it! Feel this!\" Alia clutched her head, stumbled closer to the window. She had the sill against her thighs then, but the voice still raved. \"Don\u0027t do this! Stop it and I\u0027ll help you. I have a plan. Listen to me. Stop it, I say. Wait!\" But Alia pulled her hands away from her head, clutched the broken casement. In one jerking motion, she pulled herself over the sill and was gone. Not even a screech came from her as she fell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the room they heard the crowd shout, the sodden thump as Alia struck the steps far below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeto looked at Jessica. \"We told you to pity her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica turned and buried her face in Farad\u0027n\u0027s tunic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe assumption that a whole system can be made to work better through an assault on its conscious elements betrays a dangerous ignorance. This has often been the ignorant approach of those who call themselves scientists and technologists. -The Butlerian Jihad, by Harq al-Ada\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He runs at night, cousin,\" Ghanima said. \"He runs. Have you seen him run?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Farad\u0027n said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited with Ghanima outside the small audience hall of the Keep where Leto had called them to attend. Tyekanik stood at one side, uncomfortable with the Lady Jessica, who appeared withdrawn, as though her mind lived in another place. It was hardly an hour past the morning meal, but already many things had been set moving - a summons to the Guild, messages to CHOAM and the Landsraad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarad\u0027n found it difficult to understand these Atreides. The Lady Jessica had warned him, but still the reality of them puzzled him. They still talked of the betrothal, although most political reasons for it seemed to have dissolved. Leto would assume the throne; there appeared little doubt of that. His odd living skin would have to be removed, of course... but, in time...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He runs to tire himself,\" Ghanima said. \"He\u0027s Kralizec embodied. No wind ever ran as he runs. He\u0027s a blur atop the dunes. I\u0027ve seen him. He runs and runs. And when he has exhausted himself at last, he returns and rests his head in my lap. \u0027Ask our mother within to find a way for me to die,\u0027 he pleads.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarad\u0027n stared at her. In the week since the riot in the plaza, the Keep had moved to strange rhythms, mysterious comings and goings; stories of bitter fighting beyond the Shield Wall came to him through Tyekanik, whose military advice had been asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand you,\" Farad\u0027n said. \"Find a way for him to die?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He asked me to prepare you,\" Ghanima said. Not for the first time, she was struck by the curious innocence of this Corrino Prince. Was that Jessica\u0027s doing, or something born in him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s no longer human,\" Ghanima said. \"Yesterday you asked when he was going to remove the living skin? Never. It\u0027s part of him now and he\u0027s part of it. Leto estimates he has perhaps four thousand years before metamorphosis destroys him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarad\u0027n tried to swallow in a dry throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see why he runs?\" Ghanima asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if he\u0027ll live so long and be so -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because the memory of being human is so rich in him. Think of all those lives, cousin. No. You can\u0027t imagine what that is because you\u0027ve no experience of it. But I know. I can imagine his pain. He gives more than anyone ever gave before. Our father walked into the desert trying to escape it. Alia became Abomination in fear of it. Our grandmother has only the blurred infancy of this condition, yet must use every Bene Gesserit wile to live with it - which is what Reverend Mother training amounts to anyway. But Leto! He\u0027s all alone, never to be duplicated.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarad\u0027n felt stunned by her words. Emperor for four thousand years?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jessica knows,\" Ghanima said, looking across at her grandmother. \"He told her last night. He called himself the first truly long-range planner in human history.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What... does he plan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Golden Path. He\u0027ll explain it to you later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he has a role for me in this... plan?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As my mate,\" Ghanima said. \"He\u0027s taking over the Sisterhood\u0027s breeding program. I\u0027m sure my grandmother told you about the Bene Gesserit dream for a male Reverend with extraordinary powers. He\u0027s -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean we\u0027re just to be -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not just.\" She took his arm, squeezed it with a warm familiarity. \"He\u0027ll have many very responsible tasks for both of us. When we\u0027re not producing children, that is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, you\u0027re a little young yet,\" Farad\u0027n said, disengaging his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t ever make that mistake again,\" she said. There was ice in her tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJessica came up to them with Tyekanik.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tyek tells me the fighting has spread off-planet,\" Jessica said. \"The Central Temple on Biarek is under siege.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFarad\u0027n thought her oddly calm in this statement. He\u0027d reviewed the reports with Tyekanik during the night. A wildfire of rebellion was spreading through the Empire. It would be put down, of course, but Leto would have a sorry Empire to restore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here\u0027s Stilgar now,\" Ghanima said. \"They\u0027ve been waiting for him.\" And once more she took Farad\u0027n\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old Fremen Naib had entered by the far door escorted by two former Death Commando companions from the desert days. All were dressed in formal black robes with white piping and yellow headbands for mourning. They approached with steady strides, but Stilgar kept his attention on Jessica. He stopped in front of her, nodded warily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You still worry about the death of Duncan Idaho,\" Jessica said. She didn\u0027t like this caution in her old friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reverend Mother,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it\u0027s going to be that way! Jessica thought. All formal and according to the Fremen code, with blood difficult to expunge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said: \"By our view, you but played apart which Duncan assigned you. Not the first time a man has given his life for the Atreides. Why do they do it, Stil? You\u0027ve been ready for it more than once. Why? Is it that you know how much the Atreides give in return?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m happy you seek no excuse for revenge,\" he said. \"But there are matters I must discuss with your grandson. These matters may separate us from you forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean Tabr will not pay him homage?\" Ghanima asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean I reserve my judgment.\" He looked coldly at Ghanima. \"I don\u0027t like what my Fremen have become,\" he growled. \"We will go back to the old ways. Without you if necessary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For a time, perhaps,\" Ghanima said. \"But the desert is dying, Stil. What\u0027ll you do when there are no more worms, no more desert?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Within one hundred years,\" Ghanima said, \"there\u0027ll be fewer than fifty worms, and those will be sick ones kept in a carefully managed reservation. Their spice will be for the Spacing Guild only, and the price...\" She shook her head. \"I\u0027ve seen Leto\u0027s figures. He\u0027s been all over the planet. He knows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this another trick to keep the Fremen as your vassals?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When were you ever my vassal?\" Ghanima asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar scowled. No matter what he said or did, these twins always made it his fault!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last night he told me about this Golden Path,\" Stilgar blurted. \"I don\u0027t like it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s odd,\" Ghanima said, glancing at her grandmother. \"Most of the Empire will welcome it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Destruction of us all,\" Stilgar muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But everyone longs for the Golden Age,\" Ghanima said. \"Isn\u0027t that so, grandmother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone,\" Jessica agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They long for the Pharaonic Empire which Leto will give them,\" Ghanima said. \"They long for a rich peace with abundant harvests, plentiful trade, a leveling of all except the Golden Ruler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll be the death of the Fremen!\" Stilgar protested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can you say that? Will we not need soldiers and brave men to remove the occasional dissatisfaction? Why, Stil, you and Tyek\u0027s brave companions will be hard pressed to do the job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStilgar looked at the Sardaukar officer and a strange light of understanding passed between them. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/children-of-dune-dune-chronicles-3/page-32.html","bookId":2155,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:17 PM"}
