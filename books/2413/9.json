{"id":75423,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. monroe, I appreciate you coming by to talk with me.\" Tess greeted Joey Higgins\u0027s stepfather at the door to her office. \"My secretary\u0027s gone for the day, but I can fix us some coffee if you like.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not for me.\" He stood, uncomfortable as always in her presence, and waited for her to make the first move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I realize you\u0027ve already put in a full day,\" she began, not adding she\u0027d put in one of her own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t mind the extra time if it helps Joey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" She smiled, gesturing him to a chair. \"I haven\u0027t had many opportunities to speak to you privately, Mr. Monroe, but I want to tell you that I can see how hard you\u0027re trying with Joey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t easy.\" He folded his overcoat on his lap. He was a tidy man, organized by nature. His fingers were neatly manicured, his hair combed into place, his suit dark and conservative. Tess thought she understood how inscrutable he would find a boy like Joey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s harder on Lois, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it?\" Tess sat behind her desk, knowing the distance and the impersonal position would make it easier for him. \"Mr. Monroe, coming into a family after a divorce and trying to be a father figure to a teenage boy is difficult under any circumstances. When the boy is as troubled as Joey, the difficulties are vastly multiplied.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d hoped by now, well...\" He lifted his hands, then laid them flat again. \"I\u0027d hoped we could do things together, ball games. I even bought a tent, though I have to admit I don\u0027t know the first thing about camping. But he\u0027s not interested.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t feel he can allow himself to be interested,\" Tess corrected. \"Mr. Monroe, Joey has linked himself with his father to a very unhealthy degree. His father\u0027s failures are his failures, his father\u0027s problems his problems.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bastard doesn\u0027t even-\" He cut himself off. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, don\u0027t apologize. I know it appears that Joey\u0027s rather doesn\u0027t care, or can\u0027t be bothered. It stems from his illness, but that isn\u0027t what I wanted to speak with you about. Mr. Monroe, you know I\u0027ve tried to discuss intensifying Joey\u0027s treatment. The clinic I mentioned in Alexandria specializes in emotional illness in adolescents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lois won\u0027t hear of it.\" As far as Monroe was concerned, it ended there. \"She feels, and I have to agree, that Joey would think we\u0027d abandoned him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The transition would be difficult, there\u0027s no denying that. It would have to be handled by all of us in such a way that Joey understands he isn\u0027t being punished or sent away, but offered another chance. Mr. Monroe, I have to be candid with you. Joey is not responding to treatment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not drinking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he\u0027s not drinking.\" How could she convince him that the alleviation of one symptom was far from a cure? She\u0027d already seen in their family therapy sessions that Monroe was a man who saw results much more clearly than he saw causes. \"Mr. Monroe, Joey is an alcoholic, will always be an alcoholic whether he drinks or not. He\u0027s one of twenty-eight million children of alcoholics in this country. One third of them become alcoholics themselves, as Joey has.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he\u0027s not drinking,\" Monroe persisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he\u0027s not.\" She linked her fingers, laid them on the blotter, and tried again. \"He is not consuming alcohol, he\u0027s not altering his reality with alcohol, but he has yet to deal with his dependency, and more importantly, the reasons for it. He is not getting drunk, Mr. Monroe, but the alcohol was a cover-up and an offshoot of other problems. He can\u0027t control or blanket those problems with liquor anymore, and now they\u0027re overwhelming him. He shows no anger, Mr. Monroe, no rage, and very little grief, though it\u0027s all bottled inside of him. Children of alcoholics often take on the responsibility for their parent\u0027s illness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncomfortable and impatient, Monroe shifted in his chair. \"You\u0027ve explained that before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I have. Joey resents his father, and to a great extent he resents his mother because both of them let him down. His father with his drinking, his mother with her preoccupation with his father\u0027s drinking. Because he loves them, he\u0027s turned this resentment onto himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lois did her best.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m sure she did. She\u0027s a remarkably strong woman. Unfortunately, Joey doesn\u0027t have her strength. Joey\u0027s depression has reached a dangerous stage, a critical stage. I can\u0027t tell even you what was discussed or what was said in our recent sessions, but I can tell you I\u0027m more concerned than ever over his emotional state. He\u0027s in such pain. At this point I\u0027m doing little more than soothing the pain so that he can get through the week until I can soothe it again. Joey feels his life is worthless, that he\u0027s failed as a son, as a friend, as a person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The divorce-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Divorce batters the children involved. The extent of which depends on the state of mind the children are in at the time, the way the divorce is handled, the emotional strength of the individual child. For some it can be as devastating as a death. There\u0027s usually a period of grief, of bitterness, even of denial. Self-blame is common. Mr. Monroe, it\u0027s been nearly three years since your wife separated from Joey\u0027s father. His obsession with the divorce and his part in it isn\u0027t normal. It\u0027s become a springboard for all of his problems.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused a moment, and linked her hands together again. \"His alcoholism is painful. Joey feels he deserves the pain. In fact, he appreciates it in the way a small child appreciates being disci-plined for breaking the rules. The discipline, the pain, makes him feel a part of society, while at the same time, the alcoholism itself makes Joey feel isolated from society. He\u0027s learned to depend on this isolation, on seeing himself as different, not quite as good as everyone else. Particularly you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me? I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Joey identifies with his father, a drunk, a failure both in business and in family life. You are everything his father, and therefore Joey, is not. Part of him wants to cut himself off from his father and model himself on you. The rest of him simply doesn\u0027t feel worthy, and he\u0027s afraid to risk another failure. It\u0027s gone beyond that even, Mr. Monroe. Joey is fast reaching a point where he\u0027s too tired to bother at all with life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis fingers were clenching and unclenching. When he spoke, it was his calm, board of director\u0027s voice. \"I don\u0027t follow you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suicide is the third highest cause of death among teenagers, Mr. Monroe. Joey has definite suicidal tendencies. He\u0027s already playing with the idea, circling around it with his fascination with the occult. It would take very little at this point in his life to push him over the line-an argument that leaves him feeling rebellious, a test in school that makes him feel inadequate. His fathers ambivalent behavior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough her voice was calm, the underlying urgency was communicating to him. Tess leaned forward, hoping to take it to the next step. \"Mr. Monroe, I can\u0027t stress how vital it is that Joey begin structured, intensified treatment. You trusted me enough to bring him here, to allow me to treat him. You have to trust me enough to believe me when I say I\u0027m not enough for him. I have information here on the clinic.\" She pushed a folder across the desk. \"Please discuss this with your wife, ask her to come in and talk it over with me. I\u0027ll rearrange my schedule so that we can meet any time it\u0027s convenient. But, please, make it soon. Joey needs this, and he needs it now, before something pushes him over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took the folder, but didn\u0027t open it. \"You want us to. send Joey to a place like this, but you didn\u0027t want us to have him change schools.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I didn\u0027t.\" She wanted to pull the pins out of her hair, run her hands through it until the pressure at her temples was gone. \"At that time I felt, I hoped, I could still reach him. Since September Joey\u0027s been pulling away more and more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He saw the change in schools as another failure, didn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew it was a mistake.\" He let out a long breath. \"When Lois was making the arrangements to transfer him, he looked at me. It was as if he was saying, please, give me a chance. I could almost hear him. But I backed her up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no blame here, Mr. Monroe. You and your wife are dealing with a situation where there are no easy answers. There is no absolute right or wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take the papers home.\" He rose then, slowly, as though the folder in his hand were weighty and leaden. \"Dr. Court, Lois is pregnant. We haven\u0027t told Joey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Congratulations.\" She offered her hand while her mind weighed how this news might affect her patient. \"I think it would be nice if you told him together, making it a family affair. The three of you are expecting a baby. It would be very important to Joey to be made to feel included rather than replaced. A baby, the anticipation of a baby, can bring a great deal of love into a family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve been afraid he might resent it-us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He might.\" Timing, she thought-emotional survival could so often depend on timing. \"The more he\u0027s brought into the process, into the planning, the more he\u0027ll feel a part of it. Do you have a nursery?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have a spare bedroom we thought we might redecorate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I imagine Joey would be pretty good with a paintbrush, given the chance. Please call me after you\u0027ve discussed the clinic. I\u0027d like to go over it with Joey myself, perhaps take him there so that he can see it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. Thank you, Doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTess closed the door behind him, then pulled out the pins in her hair. The band of tension eased, leaving only a dull ache. She wasn\u0027t sure she could rest easy until Joey was being treated in the clinic. At least they were turning in the right direction, she told her-self. Monroe hadn\u0027t been enthusiastic about her suggestion, but she believed he would push for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTess locked away Joey\u0027s file and his tapes, holding on to the cassette from their last session a moment longer. He\u0027d spoken of death twice during the session, both times in a matter-of-fact way. He hadn\u0027t termed it as dying but as opting out. Death as a choice. She kept the last tape out, and decided to phone the director of the clinic in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen her phone rang she nearly groaned. She could leave it. Her answering service would pick it up after the fourth ring and contact her if it was important. Then she changed her mind, holding Joey\u0027s tape in her hand as she crossed over and picked it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Dr. Court.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the silence that followed she heard labored breathing and the sounds of traffic. Automatically she pulled a pad over and picked up a pencil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Dr. Court. Can I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice was only a whisper. She heard not the panic she was half expecting, but despair. \"I can try. Would you like me to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You weren\u0027t there. If you\u0027d been there, it might have been different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here now. Would you like to see me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t.\" She heard the deep, gulping sob. \"You\u0027d know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can come to you. Why don\u0027t you tell me your name and where you are?\" She heard the click.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLess than a block away, the man in the dark coat leaned against the pay phone and wept in pain and confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn.\" Tess glanced down at the notes she\u0027d made of the conversation. If he\u0027d been a patient, she hadn\u0027t recognized his voice. On the off chance that the phone would ring again, she stayed another fifteen minutes, then gathered up her work and left the office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrank Fuller was waiting in the hall. -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, there she is.\" He slipped his breath spray back into his pocket. \"I was beginning to think you\u0027d moved out of the building.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTess glanced back at her door. Her name and profession were neatly printed on it. \"No, not yet. Working a bit late tonight, Frank?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you know how it goes.\" Actually, he\u0027d spent the last hour trying to drum up a date. He hadn\u0027t been successful. \"Apparently this police-consultant business has kept you pretty tied up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently.\" Even for someone whose manners were as ingrained as Tess\u0027s, small talk after the day she\u0027d put in was stretching things. Her thoughts drifted back to the phone call as she waited for the elevator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, Tess...\" He used his old trick of resting his hand against the wall and surrounding her. \"You might find it beneficial, professionally speaking, to consult with a colleague on this. I\u0027d be glad to make some room on my calendar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate that, Frank, but I know how busy you are.\" When the elevator doors slid open, she stepped inside. She pressed the button for the ground floor and shifted her briefcase as he stepped in beside her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never too busy for you, Tess, professionally or otherwise. Why don\u0027t we discuss it over drinks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m not at liberty to discuss it at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can find something else to discuss then. I have this bottle of wine, a cocky little Zinfandel I\u0027ve been saving for the right occasion. Why don\u0027t we go back to my place, pop the cork, and put up our feet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he could start nibbling her toes, Tess thought, and sent up a quiet prayer of thanksgiving when the doors opened again. \"No thanks, Frank.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made tracks across the lobby, but didn\u0027t shake him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t we stop in at the Mayflower, then, a quiet drink, a little music, and no shop talk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChampagne cocktails at the Mayflower. Ben had told her that was her style. Perhaps it was time to prove to him, and Frank Fuller, that it wasn\u0027t. \"The Mayflowers a bit staid for my taste, Frank.\" She flipped up her collar as they stepped into the chilly darkness of the parking lot. \"But in any case, I haven\u0027t the time for socializing. You should try that new club around the corner, Zeedo\u0027s. From what I hear, it\u0027s almost impossible not to score if you dig in for the evening.\" She pulled out her keys and slipped one into the lock of her car door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know about-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Frank.\" She clucked her tongue then patted his cheek. \"Grow up.\" Delighted with herself and his astounded expression, she slid into the car. She glanced over her shoulder as she reversed, but barely spared a glance at the man standing in the shadows at the edge of the lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d hardly gotten through the door and shed her coat and shoes, when someone knocked. If it was Frank, she\u0027d stop being polite, Tess promised herself, and give it to him right between the eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSenator Jonathan Writemore stood in his Saville Row overcoat, holding a red cardboard box of chicken and a slim paper bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grandpa.\" Most of the tension Tess hadn\u0027t been aware of having slipped away. She drew a deep breath and all but tasted the spices. \"I hope you\u0027re not on your way to a hot date.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m on my way right here.\" He dropped the box of chicken into her hands. \"It\u0027s still hot, little girl. I got extra spicy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My hero. I was about to fix myself a cheese sandwich.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Figures. Get the plates, and plenty of napkins.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slipped into the kitchen, setting the chicken on the table as she went by. \"Does this mean I\u0027m not invited to dinner tomorrow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This means you eat two decent meals this week. Don\u0027t forget the corkscrew. I have a bottle of wine here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As long as its not Zinfandel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind.\" Tess returned carrying plates, linen napkins, two of her best wineglasses, and a corkscrew. She set the table, lit the candles, then turned to give her grandfather a bear hug. \"I\u0027m so glad to see you. How did you know I needed a boost tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grandfathers are born knowing.\" He kissed both her cheeks, then scowled at her. \"You\u0027re not getting enough rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m the doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her a swat on the rear. \"Just sit down, little girl.\" He turned his attention to the wine bottle when she obeyed. Tess lifted the lid while he dealt with the cork. \"Give me one of those chicken tits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe giggled like a girl, and placed the fast food on her mother\u0027s best English bone china. \"Think how shocked your constituents would be if they heard you talking about chicken tits.\" She chose a drumstick and was delighted to discover a box of fries. \"How\u0027s the Senate business?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It takes a lot of shit to grow flowers, Tess.\" He drew the cork. \"I\u0027m still lobbying to get the Medicaid Reform bill passed. I don\u0027t know if I can pull off enough support before we adjourn for the holidays.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a good bill. It makes me proud of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Flatterer.\" He poured her wine, then his own. \"Where\u0027s the ketchup? Can\u0027t eat fries without ketchup. No, don\u0027t get up, I\u0027ll get it. When\u0027s the last time you\u0027ve been to the store?\" he asked the minute he opened the refrigerator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t start,\" she said, and took a bite of chicken. \"Besides, you know I\u0027m the expert on takeout and eat-ins.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like to think of my only granddaughter forever eating out of a carton.\" He came back in with a bottle of ketchup, easily ignoring the fact that they were both eating out of a carton. \"If I wasn\u0027t here, you\u0027d be over at that desk with a cheese sandwich and a stack of files.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I say I was glad to see you?\" Tess lifted her wineglass and smiled at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re overworking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about I buy two tickets for Saint Croix and we take off the day after Christmas? Have ourselves a week of fun in the sun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I\u0027d love to, but the holidays are the roughest on some of my patients. I have to be here for them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been having second thoughts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You?\" Bypassing the ketchup, she began to nibble on fries and wondered if she had room for a second piece of chicken. \"About what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Getting you involved with these homicides. You\u0027re looking worn out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s only partly that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Having a problem with your sex life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Privileged information.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Seriously, Tess, I\u0027ve spoken with the mayor. He\u0027s told me how involved you are with the police investigation. All I had in mind was the profile, maybe showing off my smart granddaughter a bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vicarious thrills, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The thrill takes on a different complexion after the fourth murder. Only two blocks from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grandpa, that would have happened whether I was involved with the investigation or not. The point now is, I want to be involved.\" She thought of Ben, his accusations, his resentment. She thought of her own well-ordered life and the sudden small twinges of dissatisfaction. \"Maybe I need to be involved. Things have been pretty cut and dried for me up to now in my life, and my career. My part in this has shown me a different aspect of myself, and of the system.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took up her napkin, but only kneaded it in her hands. \"The police aren\u0027t interested in the workings of his mind, in his emotional motivation, yet they\u0027ll use the knowledge to try to catch him, and to punish him. I\u0027m not interested in seeing him punished, yet I\u0027ll use what I can learn of his mind, his motivation, to try to have him stopped and helped. Which of us is right, Grandpa? Is justice punishment or is it treatment?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re talking to a lawyer of the old school, Tess. Every man, woman, and child in this country is entitled to representation and a fair trial. The lawyer might not believe in the client, but he has to believe in the law. The law says that this man has the right to be judged by the system. And usually the system works.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But does the system, the law, understand the diseased mind?\" Shaking her head, she set the napkin down again, recognizing her kneading as nerves. \"Not guilty by reason of insanity. Shouldn\u0027t it be not responsible? Grandpa, he is guilty of murdering those women. But responsible, no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not one of your patients, Tess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, he is. He has been all along, but I didn\u0027t understand that until last week-the last murder. He hasn\u0027t asked me for help yet, but he will be asking for it. Grandpa, do you remember what you said to me the day I opened my office?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe studied her, seeing that even with her intense and troubled eyes, the candlelight made her beautiful. She was his little girl. \"Probably said too many things. I\u0027ve been alive a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said that I\u0027d chosen a profession that would allow me into people\u0027s minds, and that I could never forget their hearts. I haven\u0027t forgotten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was proud of you that day. I still am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled and picked up her napkin. \"You\u0027ve got ketchup on your chin, Senator,\" she murmured, and wiped it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree and a half miles away Ben and Ed had had more than one drink. The club was decorated with wine bottles, had its fair share of regulars and a blind piano player who sang low-key rock. His tip jar was only half full, but the evening was young. Their table was roughly the size of a place mat squeezed in among a line of others. Ed worked his way through a pasta salad. Ben settled on the beer nuts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You eat enough of those,\" Ben commented with a nod at Ed\u0027s plate. \"You turn into a yuppie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t be a yuppie if you don\u0027t drink white wine.\" Sure?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking him at his word, Ben plucked up a rotini noodle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was the word when you called in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen picked up his glass and watched a woman in a short leather skirt slide past their table. \"Bigsby went by the drugstore where he bought the money order. Nothing. Who\u0027s going to remember a guy buying a money order three months ago? Aren\u0027t you going to put any salt on that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you kidding?\" Ed signaled for another round. Neither of them were drunk yet, but not for lack of trying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You going over to Kinikee\u0027s Saturday to watch the game?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got to look at apartments. I\u0027ve got to be out by the first of December.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should forget an apartment,\" Ben said as he switched to his fresh drink. \"Rent money\u0027s money down the tube. You ought to be thinking about buying your own place, investing your money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buying?\" Ed picked up a spoon and stirred his drink. \"You mean a house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. You\u0027ve got to be crazy to toss money out the window every month on rent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buy? You thinking of buying a house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On my salary?\" Ben laughed and tipped the chair back the full inch he had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last I looked, I was bringing home the same as you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I tell you what you need to do, partner. You need to get married.\" Ed said nothing, but drained half his drink. \"I\u0027m serious. You find a woman, make sure she has a good job-I mean, like a career, so she won\u0027t be thinking about dumping it after. It would help if you found one you didn\u0027t mind looking at for long periods of time. Then you combine your salaries, you buy a house, and you stop throwing away rent money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re turning my apartment building into condos, so I have to get married?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the system. Let\u0027s ask an unbiased party.\" Ben leaned over to the woman beside him. \"Excuse me, but do you believe with today\u0027s social and economic climate that two can live as cheaply as one? In fact, considering the buying power of a two-income family, that two can almost always live more cheaply than one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman set down her spritzer and gave Ben a considering look. \"Is this a pickup?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, this is a random poll. They\u0027re turning my partners apartment into a condo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The dirty bastards did the same thing to me. Now it takes me twenty minutes on the Metro to get to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have a job?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure. I manage Women\u0027s Better Dresses at Woodies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Manage?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here you go, Ed.\" Ben leaned toward him. \"Your future bride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have another drink, Ben.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re blowing a perfect opportunity. Why don\u0027t we switch places so you can...\" He trailed off as he spotted the man approaching their table. Instinctively he straightened in his chair. \"Evening, Monsignor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEd turned and saw Logan just behind him, wearing a gray sweater and slacks. \"Nice to see you again, Monsignor. Want to squeeze in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, if I\u0027m not interrupting.\" Logan managed to draw a chair up to the corner of the table. \"I called the station and they told me you\u0027d be here. I hope you don\u0027t mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen ran a finger up and down the side of his glass. \"What can we do for you, Monsignor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can call me Tim.\" Logan signaled to the waitress. \"I think that would make us all more comfortable. Bring me a St. Pauli Girl, and bring another round for my associates.\" Logan glanced over as the piano player went into one of Billy Joel\u0027s ballads. \"I don\u0027t have to ask if you two have had a hard day. I\u0027ve been in contact with Dr. Court, and I had a brief discussion with your captain a couple of hours ago. You\u0027re trying to pin down a Francis Moore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trying\u0027s the word.\" Ed pushed aside his empty plate so the waitress would clear it when she served the drinks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew a Frank Moore. Used to teach in seminary down here. Old school. Unshakable faith. The kind of priest I imagine you\u0027re more accustomed to, Ben.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, in God\u0027s light, I\u0027m sure.\" He picked up a handful of nuts. \"He died a couple of years ago. Bless you, child,\" Logan said when his beer was in front of him. \"Now old Frank wasn\u0027t a raving fanatic, he simply wasn\u0027t flexible. Today we have a lot of young priests who question and search, who debate such horny-you should forgive the pun-issues as celibacy and a woman\u0027s right to give the sacraments. It was easier for Frank Moore, who saw things in black and white. A man of the cloth doesn\u0027t lust for wine, women, or silk underwear. Cheers.\" He lifted his glass and drained what was left of the beer. \"I\u0027m telling you this because I thought I might tug on a few connections, talk to some people who would remember Frank and some of the students under him. I did some counseling at the seminary myself, but that was nearly ten years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll take what we can get.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Now that that\u0027s settled, I think I\u0027ll have another beer.\" He caught the waitress\u0027s eye, then turned back to smile at Ben. \"How many years of Catholic school?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen dug for his cigarettes. \"Twelve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The whole route. I\u0027m sure the good sisters gave you an admirable foundation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And a few good shots across the knuckles.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, bless them. They aren\u0027t all Ingrid Bergmans.\" No.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have much in common with Pat O\u0027Brien myself.\" Logan hefted his fresh beer. \"Of course, we\u0027re both Irish. Lecheim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Father Logan-Tim,\" Ed quickly corrected. \"Can I ask you a religious question?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you must.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If this guy, any guy, came to you in the confessional and told you he\u0027d done someone, murdered someone, would you turn him in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a question I can answer equally as a psychiatrist and as a priest. They\u0027re aren\u0027t many.\" He studied his beer a moment. There were times when Logan\u0027s superiors considered him too flexible, but his faith in God and in his fellow man was unwavering. \"If someone who had committed a crime came to me in the confessional, or sought my professional help, I would do my best to persuade him to turn himself in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you wouldn\u0027t push the button?\" Ben persisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If someone came to me as a doctor, or seeking absolution, they\u0027d be looking for help. I\u0027d see that they got it. Psychiatry and religion don\u0027t always see eye to eye. In this case they do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing Ed liked better than a problem with more than one solution. \"If they don\u0027t see eye to eye, how can you do both?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By struggling to understand the soul and the mind-in many ways, seeing them as one in the same. You know, as a priest I could argue the subject of creation for hours, I could give you viable reasons why Genesis stands solid as a rock. As a scientist I could do precisely the same thing with evolution and explain why Genesis is a beautiful fairy tale. As a man I could sit here and say, what the hell difference does it make, we\u0027re here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which do you believe?\" Ben asked him. He preferred one solution, one answer. The right answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That depends, in a matter of speaking, on what suit I\u0027m wearing.\" He took a long drink and realized if he had a third beer, he\u0027d be pleasantly buzzed. While enjoying the second, he began to look forward to the third. \"Unlike what old Francis Moore used to teach, there are no blacks and whites, Ben, not in Catholicism, not in psychiatry, and certainly not in life. Did God create us out of his goodness and generosity, and perhaps a sense of the ridiculous? Or did we invent God because we have a desperate, innate need to believe in something larger, more powerful, than ourselves? I argue with myself often.\" He signaled for another round.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None of the priests I knew ever questioned the order of things.\" Ben swallowed the rest of his vodka. \"It was right or it was wrong. Usually it was wrong and you had to pay for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sin in its infinite variety. The Ten Commandments were very clear. Thou shalt not kill. Yet we\u0027ve been warriors since before we could speak. The Church doesn\u0027t condemn the soldier who defends his country.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen thought of Josh. Josh had condemned himself. \"To kill one-to-one is a sin. To drop a bomb, with an American flag on it, on a village, is patriotic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are ridiculous creatures, aren\u0027t we?\" Logan said comfortably. \"Let me use a more simplistic example of interpretation. I had a young student a couple of years ago, a bright young woman who, I\u0027m embarrassed to say, knew her bible better than I could ever hope to. She came to me one day on the question of masturbation.\" He turned a little in his chair and jogged the waitress\u0027s elbow. \"Excuse me, dear.\" He turned back. \"She had a quote, I\u0027m sure I won\u0027t get it quite right, but it had to do with it being better that a man cast his seed into the belly of a whore than to spill it onto the ground. A pretty strong stand, one might say, against, ah, self-servicing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mary Magdalene was a whore,\" Ed mumbled as the booze began to catch up with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So she was.\" Logan beamed at him. \"In any case, my student\u0027s point was that the female has no seed to cast anywhere or to spill on the ground. Therefore, it must only be a sin to masturbate if you\u0027re a male.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen remembered a couple of sweaty, terrifying sessions during puberty. \"I had to say the whole damn rosary,\" he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had to say it twice,\" Logan put in, and for the first time saw Ben relax with a grin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you tell her?\" Ed wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told her the bible often speaks in generalities, that she should search her conscience. Then I looked up the quote myself.\" He took a comfortable drink. \"Damned if I didn\u0027t think she had a point.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sacred-sins/page-9.html","bookId":2413,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:02 AM"}
