Here, they are the ones weak or dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here, nothing is real!” I cried. Riser lifted his finger to his poked-out lips, then winked—not in humor, but giving sound advice. No sense encouraging our old spirits at this stage of our journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe folowed as Vinnevra crossed to a path on the right, and then another—this one long and straight. Behind, the ferry grew smaler and smaler, until I could cover it with my thumb . . . and then the center of the web went dark and the ferry with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind us, below us, darkness. Above . . . the inner surface of the wheel might be up there, its false landscapes just barely painted on—deserted cities, blasted plains covered with ashen dust, dead Forerunners, al that we had left behind, including our felow humans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr perhaps that had been smudged out as wel. The wheel itself might be gone, and that would mean there was only this glowing web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo often, in a dream, you can never go back to where you were, and if you try, it’s not what you remember. If our ultimate destination was to be Erde-Tyrene—Erda—that would violate this most basic law of al dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd where there is a web, there might very wel be a spider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I realy wanted to piss myself or loose my already-empty bowels, to disgust any predator with my stink—humans can make such a great stink!—and run, run, or leap over the edge and fal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaling, perhaps I would come awake and jump up from my rough bed of grass and wood slats, hear my mother clinking pots in the next room—stretch, yawn, plan for another day doing whatever Riser thought would be best for us to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHappy times, those. Best of times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo going back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if I had died, if I was already across the western waters, clearly I had not found favor with Abada.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked. The dead, some of the old stories say, walk forever and never know where they are going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiser was the first to see the spider. He poked my hip—hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking to our left now I saw the jagged, spiky blue leg—and then another. Riser yawped and tried to climb my torso as if I were a tree. I let him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClutching my friend and turning slowly, awkwardly left, I saw Mara, and beyond her—far beyond her—yet another long, jagged leg, moving and dropping to touch part of the web-maze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCompleting my turn, I saw dozens of legs prancing slowly and delicately across the web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as I had feared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took al the courage or foolishness I possessed to lean back and look up. Above, supported by those flashing, sharp-angled blue legs, hung a mass of close-packed crystals, big as a city but upside- down and pulsing with a deep, shadowy light. The facets of the crystals crawled with intense glowworm stars, drawing luminous threads behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy flashing and flexing, the legs had revealed they were not legs, but more like solid lightning supporting the crystal mass. The legs vanished, reappeared, then flexed and bowed as if under a great weight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crystal city lowered over us. At its center, an emerald green glow thrust out, brighter than anything around it—and extruded the most watchful glow of al.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA single, central green eye cast down a darting, baleful light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiser clutched me al the tighter. Vinnevra stood immobile with an expression of forlorn, final hope, hope about to give up and die— while Mara rose to her ful height, squared her considerable shoulders, and opened her mouth to roar. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crystal city decorated itself with more threads of light, and the entirety swung back over us, behind us, then down and through the web, where it paused at right angles to the pathways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe threads merged with the paths and avenues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe faced directly the jutting wal of crystals, at a level with the huge green eye. The green eye had become the center of the maze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smel of food became stronger. Despite my terror, my mouth watered. I was being tugged along like an animal, helplessly lured on by my most basic drives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVinnevra swung around. Her face was ghastly green in the reflected glow. “We’re home!” she cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe great green eye lifted. The web of paths was slowly extinguished by darkness flowing from the cobwebbed crystal mass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have seen this before, Lord of Admirals informed me, and I realized the old spirit was not in the least frightened, and not because he was already dead. He could feel harm coming to his old enemies, harm being done to the Forerunners—and that was far more important than his own welfare, or mine. This is the one who betrays Forerunners, their own greatest monster. We know this one. Remember?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I did not—not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWals descended around us, at first reflecting the jeweled eye, but then scenes and images played across their pale surfaces like sketches for yet more dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStil, the old spirit refused to be cowed. We are here because some humans are immune to the Shaping Sickness. We carry that secret. And we have not yet given it up to them. If we do, we die!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the inner voice was overwhelmed by a blaze of animal hunger. Al sober judgment and thought was squeezed tight, then crammed down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wals finished sketching, painting, then projecting a place in which we could al be comfortable and at home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn even greater lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-Seven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWE WALKED THROUGH a forest of old, dignified trees, then over a meadow of sun-dappled grass, luled by the buzzing of passing insects—none of which tried to bite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the center of the warm glade rose a long, thick wooden table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpread across that table were al the glorious foods we had smeled before, when we rode on the . . . the what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVinnevra ran ahead and took a middle seat on a bench, then smiled sympatheticaly at Mara. The ape ambled forward wilingly enough, but she gave me a look that seemed both wise, cautious— and doubtful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStil, there was food, there was sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ape joined Vinnevra, squatting behind her, and the girl passed her a bowl of fruit, which she delicately pinched up with thick fingers, then chewed on thoughtfuly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked around the table and sat across from Vinnevra. Puling forward a large bowl, and then a smaler one, I served up Riser stewed grain, vegetables, and sliced meat, roasted to perfection and sprinkled with salt. Hot, rich, delicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiser, strangely, seemed only half-present, but for the moment that did not alarm me. From the corner of my eye, I saw him eating and was glad; but I could not make out his expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s been a long journey, hasn’t it?” Vinnevra said, flashing me a happy smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis forest was little like the forests I had known, thornier and drier. The sun was high and bright and the sky was just the correct shade of blue, and there was no . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSky bridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe ate until we could eat no more, and then decided to leave the table to sit in the shade of a broad-spreading, thick-leafed giant of a tree that rose almost high enough to touch the passing clouds. For a while, I knew we had indeed returned to Erde-Tyrene, as Vinnevra had suggested we would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Too bad Gamelpar couldn’t be here,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave me a quizzical look. “But he is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI accepted that. “Where are al the others?” I asked around the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiser—off to one side—did not answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVinnevra kept smiling. “They’re here, too. We’l meet them soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsn’t this wonderful?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe daylight turned to dusk as it always had on Erde-Tyrene, high clouds pink and orange, then purple, brown, and gray. Stars came out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook at the patterns of the stars. This is not— The moon rose. The others found beds in the soft grass and moss and roled up and slept, except for myself and Mara, who moved away from Vinnevra and closer to me, grumbling deep in her chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moon, bright and green, watched over us until my own eyes closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the great green eye probed deep, reminding me, with a strange enthusiasm, that we had met before. The Master Builder had conducted that first interview, with the help of this green-eyed ancila, a very different sort from the lesser monitors and servile ancilas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ancila proudly informed me—and by transfer, the Lord of Admirals—that it had indeed been placed in charge of this wheel, and ultimately of al Forerunner defenses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt informed us it was quite capable of lying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it played.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether it actualy moved us about the wheel and made us live through other journeys, or simply scratched over our memories with fabricated dreams, I wil never know. It certainly had the power to do both. And the freedom. It no longer served either the Master Builder or Forerunners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhom does it serve now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe orb was approaching—time must be short. Stil, the master of the wheel distracted me—did not alow me to use my powers of reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAl the journeys and years ended with a burst of pain—immense pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, the old spirit was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSCIENCE TEAM ANALYSIS: Separate streams of data follow, differing substantially from those connected to the Lord of Admirals. Analysis not yet complete, but we suggest skepticism as to their veracity and usefulness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eONI COMMANDER: “None of this seems to be trustworthy. It’s almost a sure thing that we’re being fed fabrications. And if not— how can we even begin to correlate these so-called memories with actual events, after a hundred thousand years?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSCIENCE TEAM LEADER: “I cannot disagree, but we still find, scattered throughout, curious correlations with recent discoveries.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eONI COMMANDER: “Little bits of bait making us swallow the whole damned lie, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSCIENCE TEAM LEADER: “Possibly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSTRATEGY TEAM ADVISOR: “We’re interested in the references to this ‘subverted AI.’ We already have records reclaimed—so to speak—from variations of what may very well be that Forerunner artifact.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eONI COMMANDER: “Nothing but trouble!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSTRATEGY TEAM LEADER: “True, but we’re likely going to encounter more like it. Any insight this monitor can provide will be greatly appreciated.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eONI COMMANDER: “I’d still like to focus on the Didact.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSCIENCE TEAM LEADER: “Gentlemen, I’ve been skipping ahead a little. Let’s move forward in the record. I doubt any of you will be disappointed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eONI COMMANDER: “None of us is pleasant company, Professor, when we’re disappointed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSCIENCE TEAM LEADER: “Duly noted, sir.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-Eight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI SPENT A hundred years walking in circles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuestions were asked. I could not remember either the questions or my answers. I could not even remember who was asking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlowly, however, I recaled certain memories. Some were acceptable; others were not, and I pushed them back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinaly, I opened my eyes to a great stretch of star-filed space, at the center of which hung a huge, red and gray sphere, tormented by craters—an icy planet. Impacts over milions of milennia had carved a wolf onto the surface. I might have been out in space, suspended just like this orb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen my point of view swiveled and dropped. I looked down over a wide swath of the wheel, the Halo, as if from a high mountain. I was told I was witnessing part of what was sometimes caled the Silent Cartographer—the complete and living record of the Halo. Those who would help rescue and then use the wheel were alowed to explore and learn in this place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore memories returned. The band below swept up and away in the familiar fashion to the sky bridge. Many hundreds of kilometers below, huge squares—plates of gray-blue Halo foundation material —were being maneuvered by machines over the limiting wals on either side of the band, stacking up through the atmosphere, while cloudy swirls of interrupted weather gathered around the lowest plates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Halo was preparing for its coming chalenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt nothing—took no breath, experienced no sensation. Only cold thought left me any hope of stil being alive. Stil, I came to enjoy this isolation. No feeling, no pain—only education and watchful eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I also heard voices. A kind of selective blindness lifted and I realized I was standing—leaning slightly to one side, but standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red and gray world blocking out the stars, so near to the wheel, remained—as did the stars and the wheel itself. But beneath my feet, I became aware of a dark platform, and then, of shadows— many shadows moving in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smaler shadow came close, stretched out a blurry hand—and al came into focus. I looked out upon dozens of people—humans al, some like me, many others different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRiser gripped my fingers. I knelt and took him in my arms. He whined at my touch. “Hurts,” he said, and turned around to show a punched-out mark in his back—healed over, but furless, pink and angry looking. “Stung deep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt my own back and cringed at the shalow hole my fingers found. I puled them back, expecting to see blood—but they were dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMale and female, we were al naked. Most looked as old as Gamelpar had been before he died. Only a few were as young as me. Few words passed. We stood out under the stars, caught in the light of the red and gray planet, rapidly closing the distance between itself and the wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who brought us here?” I asked Riser. He circled his fingers and looped them in front of his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Green-eye,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe closest male, a tal, elderly, brown-skinned felow with a short jaw and thick neck, tried to say a few words, but I could not understand him. No old spirit rose up to interpret and Riser himself —master of so many human languages—didn’t understand, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA female gently pushed the elder aside and spoke simply and in broken phrases, like a child, but at least I could understand her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You the last,” she said. “Al . . . others . . . little ago, little time. But you last.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she turned and revealed that in the smal of her wrinkled, suntanned back, a chunk had also been removed . . . and healed over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe younger members came forward. The elders parted and let them through, and Riser approached them, sniffing and judging in that way he had, which I never mistrusted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he darted off and vanished for a moment among the crowd of elders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese younger men and women—there were no children— gathered and compared their healed wounds. Some seemed embarrassed by their nakedness, others, not. Some were glassy- eyed, terrified into muteness, but others, as if at a signal, began chattering away. I was surrounded by five or six very communicative men and four or five women. Somehow I had been singled out, perhaps because I was the last to arrive, or the last to wake up. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-primordium-halo-9/page-25.html","bookId":1632,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:22:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:22:08 PM"}
