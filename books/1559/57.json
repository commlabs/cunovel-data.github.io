Fezzik’s father handled tactics and ring strategy, while his mother was more in charge of diet and training, and they had never been happier. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-princess-bride/page-57.html","bookId":1559,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:31:14 PM"}
