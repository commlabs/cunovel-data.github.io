During this soul-stirring watch, he should be the happiest person in Chang’an.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll his foes were defeated, and he had accomplished everything he needed to accomplish. After today, who could possibly challenge him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, could anyone tell whether, deep in his heart, he was really as happy as one would imagine?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai asked himself the same question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—If he didn’t plan to kill Sima, why had he taken the time to defeat him? Why defeat the heroic idol that he himself had created? Wouldn’t he end up just as disappointed as all the other heroes in the world?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t know the answer to these questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—If he didn’t plan to kill Sima, why not just give in to him? Why not just quietly acquiesce?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai didn’t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe only knew that he could not have attacked with the edge of the blade. He could never allow Sima Chaoqun to die by his hand. Just as he could never kill himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn some aspects, he was a part of Sima Chaoqun, and parts of himself had been replaced by Sima.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he truly believed that even without Sima Chaoqun, he would continue on living, and the Great Protection Agency would continue to exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time he finished his fourth cup, his spirits had lifted, and he was preparing to have one more drink before lying down to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs his hand reached out to pour the wine, his heart suddenly dropped and his pupils constricted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had suddenly noticed that the box beneath the lamp was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were guards surrounding the area day and night. No one could easily sneak into this room, and no one knew that this ordinary, old-fashioned box was a fearsome and mysterious weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho would possibly risk their life to come here to take it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a shattering sound as the crystal drinking vessel in Zhuo Donglai’s hand was crushed. He suddenly realized that it was very likely he had made a mistake. He suddenly thought back to Zhuo Qing’s expression just before he died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he heard someone knocking on the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Enter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA strapping young man pushed open the door and entered; tall and broad-shouldered, with large hands, his clothes were well arranged, albeit ordinary, his expression serious and sincere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Great Protection Agency was a very large, and strictly organized. Every job, every action, was overseen by someone. But not many received direct orders from Zhuo Donglai, so among the lower ranks, few had the chance to see him face to face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai had never seen this young man before, but he could guess who he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Zheng Cheng.” Zhuo Donglai looked at him calmly. “I understand you have performed many services for Zhuo Qing recently. But you should know that this isn’t a place that anyone can just casually enter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your disciple knows.” Zheng Cheng was respectful and sincere in his response. “But I couldn’t not come.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A month ago, he took me in as one of his direct subordinates and began giving me assignments. When he asks me to do something, I cannot disobey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was Zhuo Qing who told you to come here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” said Zheng Cheng. “To speak for him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To speak for him?” said Zhuo Donglai harshly. “Why does he need you to speak for him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because he is dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If he wasn’t dead, you wouldn’t come?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Correct,” said Zheng Cheng calmly. “If he was still alive, I wouldn’t reveal what he told me even if I were thrown into a vat of boiling oil.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You needed to wait until after he died before coming?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Correct. His orders were that if he died, I must come to see Mr. Zhuo within two hours, and transmit his words without any omissions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai looked at him coldly. He had suddenly noticed that Zheng Cheng’s attitude and manner of speaking were just like Zhuo Qing’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s dead,” said Zheng Cheng, “so your disciple came. I didn’t dare not to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shattered fragments of the crystal drinking vessel glittered under the lamplight. Each piece seemed to shine like Zhuo Qing’s eyes as death approached him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai thought of his attitude before he had died, and after a long time he asked Zheng Cheng, “When did he give you these orders?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This evening.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This evening?” Zhuo Donglai’s pupils constricted again. “Of course it was this evening.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that time, he and Sima Chaoqun had already arrived at the cemetary-like house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that time, Zhuo Qing could have found time to wash himself and change clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, he didn’t do things the way he normally did. What he did, he would only reveal to Zhuo Donglai after his death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai stared at Zheng Cheng.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At that time he knew he was about to die?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For the most part. He told me that he most likely would not live past sunrise tomorrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He had a nice life, how could he die?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He knew that someone was planning to kill him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who was this person?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You.” Zheng Cheng looked straight at Zhuo Donglai. “He said it was you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would I want him dead?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because he had done too many things for you, and knew too much. You wouldn’t leave him for Sima Chaoqun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He could see that you and Sima Chaoqun had reached a breaking point, and regardless of whether it was because of Sima or yourself, you would first send him to his grave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He calculated things so well. Why didn’t he just flee?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because he had no time. He never imagined things would happen so quickly, and it was too late to make another plan. Before you and Sima fought, you would call for him. If you found that he had fled, you would drop everything and pursue him. At his current level of power, he could not escape your control.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When the time came, the worst that could happen is that he would die. Why didn’t he try to fight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because when the time came, Sima’s grief was most likely subsiding, and his determination wavering. It would be even more difficult to avoid death if you and Sima reunited. You know what kind of person he is. He wouldn’t let that happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai’s fists clenched into balls. “So he would rather die than allow Sima and I to be reunited?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Correct,” said Zheng Cheng. “If the two of you are united, you will succeed. If you are split apart, you will be defeated. He had to seek vengeance for himself, and this was his only opportunity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai laughed coldly. “He’s already dead, yet he can still seek revenge for himself?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Correct. He told me to tell you that you killed him, and he will make you regret it. Before he died, he dug a grave for you. Sooner or later the day will come for you to lie down it it. And he told me to tell you that that day will arrive soon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai stared at him. One word at a time he said, “But I’m not dead yet. I can kill you in the time it takes to raise a hand. And I can let you die without a proper burial.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then how can you dare to stand in front of me and speak so rudely?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because these are not my words, they are Zhuo Qing’s.” Zheng Cheng’s facial expression did not change. “He told me what to tell you word for word. If I left anything out, it would be disloyal to you and unfaithful to him.” His attitude was very solemn and sincere. “I don’t have the qualifications to be a disloyal, unfaithful person.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not qualified?” Zhuo Donglai couldn’t help but ask. “What qualifications must one have to be disloyal and unfaithful?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To be an openly disloyal and unfaithful person, people must hate you, yet treat you with the utmost respect. If you want to be a disloyal and unfaithful person without those qualifications, then you definitely deserve to die without a proper burial.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai stared at him for a very long time. And then one word at a time asked, “Am I qualified to be this kind of person?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout hesitation, Zheng Cheng responded, “Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai suddenly laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shouldn’t have laughed. What Zheng Cheng said was not funny, not even one word of it. Anyone who heard what he said would agree that it was not amusing at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet he laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well said. Very well said.” Zhuo Donglai smiled. “If a person is qualified to be unfaithful and disloyal, what in the world could cause worry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Most likely nothing,” said Zheng Cheng, sincerely. “If I can reach that level one day in my life, I wouldn’t worry about anything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then work hard,” said Zhuo Donglai. “I really hope you achieve your goal.” He laughed. “Zhuo Qing must have calculated that I wouldn’t kill you, because at this time, I need people like you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng Cheng looked at him, his eyes filled with respect, the same way that Zhuo Qing had looked at him in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s another person,” said Zheng Cheng. “Someone else who is very likely more useful than me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gao Jianfei. He has been waiting for you. I’ve asked him to leave, but he just stays. It doesn’t matter how long I say he needs to wait, he won’t leave. He says he has nowhere else to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then let him wait,” said Zhuo Donglai coolly. “Although, being forced to wait is not easy. Treat him well. Whatever he wants, give him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng Cheng stepped back slowly. It seemed he was waiting for further questions from Zhuo Donglai.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Zhuo Donglai had no questions. In fact, he had already closed his eyes, and seemed to have fallen to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the lamplight, his face seemed very tired. Pale white, weak, and tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, as Zheng Cheng looked at him, his eyes were filled with veneration, a respect and fear that spilled forth from the bottom of his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was because he was different from others. His viewpoint and reaction to matters were different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng Cheng left, closing the door behind him. And when the cold wind hit him, he realised that the crotch of his pants was thoroughly soaked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart 2\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai was not like other people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn situation where others would be heartbroken or furious, he would laugh. In situations where others became amazed and excited, his reaction was extraordinarily cheerless, to the extent that sometimes he had no reaction at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew Gao Jianfei had arrived, and he awaited him with the fervor of a love-smitten teen awaiting a lover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew that the tear stains on Gao Jianfei’s sword could instantly transform into bloodstains, the blood of his enemies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet this seemed to provoke no reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe box on the table was gone, and the box’s owner, just settled into the little courtyard, was also likely gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Qing had set his mind on revenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he had wanted to find the most fearsome possible enemy for Zhuo Donglai, Xiao Leixue was definitely the ideal choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFragrance of the Gentleman was not the type of drug that once used was effective forever. If not continually administered, Xiao Leixue’s power would be completely restored in two or three days.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat could possibly be Zhuo Donglai’s appointed time to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApart from that, there were many other things Zhuo Qing could have done, things that would create many regrets for Zhuo Donglai.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis accounts, his wealth, his communications, his secrets, all could be used by Zhuo Qing to betray him, along with every disloyal subordinate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—What tomb had Zhuo Qing excavated for him as he approached death?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf this had been happening to someone else, Zhuo Donglai would have used all his power and methods to investigate the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut right now, he did nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai fell asleep. Really fell asleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, he walked into his bedroom and closed the window. In a secret location at the head of his bed was hidden button, which he pushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, from a dark cabinet in another hidden location, he pulled out a tiny, jewel-encrusted container. From within the container, he extracted a light green pill, which he swallowed. It was a medicine that could help him to sleep peacefully no matter the circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was extremely exhausted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA glorious victory would usually make a person extremely exhausted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd under the circumstances, the only thing that could help one to restore clear-headedness, was sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key to life and death, victory and defeat, was usually decided in a fleeting instant of time. When the time came to make decisions like that, one needed to be completely clear-headed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so he needed sleep. As far as he was concerned, nothing was more important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd no one could judge the importance or weightiness of a matter better than Zhuo Donglai.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he fell asleep, he thought only of one person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t think of Zhuo Qing, who had died so horribly beneath his blade, nor Xiao Leixue, who might come to claim his life at any time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought about his brother, his brother whose whole life had been death. The brother with whom he had lived in their mother’s womb for ten months, with whom he had struggled to receive nutrients and blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had never seen his brother. His brother was only a murky, hazy shadow in his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in that dim, illusory moment before entering sleep, the blurry shadow suddenly transformed into a person, a person who he could see very clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it looked like Sima Chaoqun\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart 3\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFar way, someone sounded out the night watch on a drum. The third watch had passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch a dull drum beat, dreary and emotionless. Once the third watch has come, one cannot stay behind in the second watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSima Chaoqun clearly recalled having just heard the drum beating, and he remembered that it was the second watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had heard quite clearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that time he was already somewhat drunk. But despite having drunk about 7 or 8 bottles, he was merely tipsy. His head was extremely clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clearly remembered that he had been in a tiny wine shop, drinking. Other than him, there was a big table of customers. They were all young men, 18 or 19 years old, holding four of five women at least twice their age. They were shooting their mouths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were praising Sima Chaoqun, saying he was the greatest hero in the world, a rarity under heaven, and how they were friends with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were bragged happily, and their audience listened happily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was only one person who wasn’t happy, and that was Sima Chaoqun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so he drank without regard to his life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered clearly that as they happily shot their mouths off, he had suddenly stood up and slapped the table. “What is Sima Chaoqun? He’s f*cking nothing! He’s not even human. Not worth a copper coin! Not worth a fart!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more he cursed, the happier he felt. But the people listening weren’t happy. One of them suddenly turned over the table, and they charged over, ten in total. He split one of their noses in two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese things, Sima Chaoqun remembered clearly, better than a young schoolboy could remember the Thousand Character Classic. \u0026nbsp;\u003ca href\u003d\"#footnote_2\"\u003e[2]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe even remembered that one of the women, her face painted with rouge so badly that she looked like a wild animal, had taken a wooden clog off her foot and smacked him in the head with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that, he didn’t remember anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that time, he’d heard the second watch being sounded, and now it was the third watch. \u0026nbsp;\u003ca href\u003d\"#footnote_3\"\u003e[3]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore, he’d been sitting in a tiny wine shop, drinking. Now he was lying down, in a dark, treeless, windless, moonless alley. His head seemed eight times heavier than normal and his throat was like a kitchen stovepipe.

How did you end up like this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSima Chaoqun decided to ignore him, to pretend that he hadn’t even seen him. But the man seemed insistent on being seen.

If you hadn’t finished that last half jug of wine just now, how could those little bastards have hurt even a hair of yours?” His voice was filled with sorrow. “Boss, if you hadn’t drunk so much that your body was weakened, how could those little bastards have beaten you this way? How could that fat b*tch have knocked a hole in your head with her clog? Those brats would normally piss themselves in fear just hearing your name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I really just got beaten up?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSima was really doubtful, but after he rubbed his head and ribs, he had no choice but to believe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It looks like I really did get beaten up.” He suddenly laughed heartily. “Good.

If the heroes of the world found out, those little bastards would laugh until their teeth fell out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh Gen didn’t laugh.

I let down the boss. But Zhu Meng is like the boss, a courageous and upright hero, who believes in righteousness. I can’t betray him at a time like this. So, I came to Chang’an with him, prepared to accompany him in death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kowtowed again, his face dripping with blood. “Ah Gen deserves to die.

Even if we all die, we shall become evil spirits that haunt his soul.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pointed at Sima Chaoqun. “Now he’s here. You heard clearly everything he said. He came to repay his debt. A debt of blood must be repaid with blood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis blade-like eyes swept over his subordinates. “He’s alone, just like us, deserted and isolated, with no loved ones. But we have ourselves, brothers, and we must have vengeance. Now is the best opportunity. He can’t stand up to all of us by himself.” His voice grew in intensity. “You all have blades in hand. You can draw them and hack his head off right here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one drew their blade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stood listening quietly, not willing to even look at Sima Chaoqun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why don’t you do something?” Zhu Meng shouted. “Have your hands grown weak? Have you forgotten how to kill?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh Gen suddenly stepped forward, and then prostrated himself before Sima Chaoqun and Zhu Meng.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Boss, I know you came here with me because you were ready to die,” he said. “You have lived a worthy life, you can die without regrets. After you have died, I will arrange all your affairs, and then I will join you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSima Chaoqun laughed heartily. “Good. You’re a good brother.” He laughed. “Well said. A worthy life. Die without regrets.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, there was a clanging sound as a blade dropped from someone’s hand onto the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhu Meng looked at the person, and asked harshly, “Man Niu, you’ve always been a good man, never afraid to kill. How come you can’t keep ahold of your blade?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMan Niu hung his head, his face covered with tears of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Clan Leader, you know that I’ve dreamed of cutting his head off. But now…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But now what?” Zhu Meng’s voice was even more shrill. “Don’t tell me you don’t want to kill him now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I do, but if you ask me to kill him in this way, there’s no way that I can do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know why.” Man Niu kneeled, and slapped himself in the face with his sword. “I should die. I’m a coward who deserves to die. I know in my heart, but if the Clan Leader asks me to say it, I couldn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re a coward, so you can’t say it, but I can say it,” said Zhu Meng. “You can’t do it because you suddenly realize that the man we have wanted to kill for so long is a true man. He’s brave enough to come alone to meet us, and therefore we should treat him like a true man. If we killed him like this, even if it’s for revenge, then we could never have the face to stand in front of the other heroes of the world.” He asked Man Niu, “Is that what you’re thinking in your heart?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMan Niu banged his forehead against the ground, his face obscured by the tears of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhu Meng’s knife-like gaze swept over his men. “And the rest of you?” he asked them, this group of men who had followed him through countless battles, who had narrowly escaped death with him, and who had nothing left except their lives. “How do you feel in your hearts?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one responded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the hands that gripped blades were wounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven though they had already lost everything, they hadn’t lost their spirit of uprightness, loyalty and courage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhu Meng looked at them, one by one, and his exhausted, expressionless eyes once again lit up. He lifted his head and said, “Good. These are true brothers. These are truly Zhu Meng’s brothers. Having befriended brothers like this, I can die without any feeling of bitterness.” He turned to Sima Chaoqun. “Do you see? Do you see what kind of brothers Zhu Meng has? Are any of them cowards?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSima Chaoqun’s eyes were red, had long since grown red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he shed no tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood there as straight as a spear. After a long time, he said, one word at a time, “Zhu Meng, I can’t compare with you. I’m not even good enough to wipe your ass. Because,” he said, “I don’t have brothers like these.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t spoken by some other person, it was spoken by Sima Chaoqun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe matchless hero Sima Chaoqun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhu Meng’s eyes contained no hint of self-satisfaction, but instead were filled with sadness, as if he were asking himself: —Why are we enemies and not friends?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t say it, though. Instead, he said, “No matter what, if you treat us well, we will not treat you poorly. But there’s one thing that can’t change.” His fists clenched. “I’m still Zhu Meng, and you are still Sima Chaoqun. And therefore, I must still kill you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a type of honour, just like an eternally unchanging love. The sea can dry up, rocks can whither away, but this type of honor will exist forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of this type of honor, men in Jianghu with nothing, without even roots or history, can still live forever in the hearts of those who value courage and uprightness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As you just said,” continued Zhu Meng, “this is a matter between the two of us. We should resolve it ourselves. Has the time come?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhu Meng stared at him for a long time, and then suddenly said, “Give the great hero Sima a blade.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMan Niu immediately grabbed his sword and carried it over with two hands. It was a steel broadsword, forged by a hundred hammer blows, its edge already nicked in several places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This isn’t a very good blade,” said Zhu Meng, “but in Sima Chaoqun’s hands, any blade can kill.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” Sima Chaoqun gently caressed the weak spots on the blade. “This blade is made to be a killing blade.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Therefore, you have to promise me something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Promise what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you have a chance to kill me, you must not under any circumstances show mercy.” Zhu Meng’s voice once again became sad. “Otherwise, if I then kill you, I may regret it for the rest of my life. Do you want me to hold regret in my heart for the rest of my life?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSima Chaoqun’s response was very understanding. “If I’m able to kill you in one move, then you won’t see the second move.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good,” said Zhu Meng. “Extremely good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhu Meng’s blade gleamed as he unsheathed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone else in the room stepped back. They were Zhu Meng’s brothers, through thick and thin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they all stepped back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince ancient times, people have been unable to avoid death. What was extraordinary about death?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the dignity and loyalty of true men was something incapable of being tarnished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding his sword horizontally, Zhu Meng asked, “If I die beneath your blade, my brothers won’t come after you. Zhu Meng can die under the blade of Sima Chaoqun with no regrets.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, he could not help but turn his head and glance back at Die Wu. It could be the last time he would ever lay eyes on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—I’m willing to die beneath your blade. I just hope that you will be able to take care of her for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t say these words. Instead, he said, “If you die beneath my blade, I will definitely take care of your wife and children.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My wife and children?” Sima Chaoqun smiled sadly. “I’m afraid my wife and children are waiting for me to die beneath your blade so that I can take care of them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhu Meng’s heart sank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this moment he realized that perhaps Sima’s sorrow and pain was much heavier and much deeper than his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he had already unsheathed his blade. The blade’s course was set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis heart’s course was set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLife and death would be decided in a fleeting moment. Sadly, there was nothing in the world that could prevent this battle to the death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet at this exact moment, at this fleeting moment—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Zhu Meng.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly heard someone call out. The voice seemed to come from far away, from very far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the person calling for him was at his side, a women who could at any time ask him to die for her, and he would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA person who could not be forgotten even in dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe departed have gone, but the emotions remain\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDance for the king, transform into a butterfly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhu Meng didn’t look back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis blade was in hand.

He was duty-bound not to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Zhu Meng,” the voice called again. “Zhu Meng.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch a distant call, and yet so near.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA call so near, and yet so far, as distant as home is in the dreams of a wanderer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe home of a wanderer could only be found in the midst of deep, deep pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhu Meng looked back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother clanging sound rang out.
