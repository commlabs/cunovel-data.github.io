This is one I cannot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t be strong without you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed; it was fake, “You are stronger than you think.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I’m not. You have to say that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned in and kissed my forehead, “Consider inviting me to Christmas. Please, baby. I want to see you in all your glory, pajamas till noon and everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt the dam breaking. The tears were winning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed each of my eyelids, “Go now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and walked to the helicopter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pilot started it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to sob.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eServario pointed at me. Coop grabbed one of my hands, dragging me to the cave entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stepped into the darkness and all I could think about, was the light behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked for a while before my eyes adjusted. The dark of the tunnel was annoying and never ending. My eyes were sticking from the tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop never let go of my hand. He squeezed tight, pulling me through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy CI brain switched on about halfway. Our pace slowed and I knew what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI never doubted for a second, that each one of us assumed it was a trap of sorts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn’t trust Servario, not completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe never heard Roxy’s story or James’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe took everything Servario had said at face value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the dark, Jack whispered, “Is anyone else seeing that last scene in the movie The Usual Suspects rolling around in their head? You know where Kevin Spacey leaves the police station and his limp slowly leaves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, “I have that same bad feeling I had on the plane.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop nodded, “I don’t know what to expect on the other side of this tunnel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuce laughed bitterly, “I’m waiting for him to shoot it with bombs and collapse it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe all started running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tripped but Coop dragged me up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Light!” Luce shouted back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe slowed when we saw it get brighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we got closer we could see the light around the edges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop went to the front. He ran his hands on the metal of the door, making an almost-silent scratching noise against it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No handle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged, “Knock.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe banged lightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething made a grinding noise, and instantly, dust moved in the beams of light we had around us from the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt pulled back and light filled the dank space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes needed a second to adjust, but when they did I didn’t believe what I saw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Daddy?” I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man looked much older, grey-haired and more wrinkled than before, but he was my father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face split into a grin, but I could see the panic in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile was fake. He wasn’t happy to see me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to cry but the commander didn’t like crying. At least I didn’t think he did, but tears leaked from his old, green eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held his arms out for me. I leapt into them. He wrapped and squeezed and I couldn’t breathe but I didn’t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mommy!” I caught the word being screamed from beyond my father and I.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy ears caught it in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad kissed me on the cheek and pulled me back, “Go see them. They’ve missed you, something fierce.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and felt the collapse of the walls inside of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI broke free of him and ran along the cobblestone. I dropped to my knees and they jumped me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cried as hard as they did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You took too long!” Jules squeaked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cried and sniffled, “I’m so sorry. It was more work than I thought.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoop ruffled Mitch’s head, “Hey, kid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMitch stood up and crossed his arms over his chest, “Hey, Coop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled at the way he tried to be a big boy around Coop. They seemed to hit it off the moment they met, back at the house after James’ funeral. Jules clung to me for a second longer and then pulled my hand, “Come see. There’s a real princess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled and looked back at Luce and Jack. He mouthed, “I knew it. Ise Grand Shrine temple.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and gave him the thumbs up, “I don’t know what that means?” I mouthed back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack made a face, “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and said aloud, “Nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked back at my dad, “How?” I asked, being cryptic because of the others around us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad grinned, knowing I meant how had they fooled me all along. He shrugged subtly, “A hell of a lot of work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, “I bet. So Mom and you both?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, “Your mom more than me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, still baffled, “How?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad laughed again, “A hell of a lot of work!” He linked arms with me as Luce and Jack introduced themselves to Jules. She dragged them up the road. Coop and Mitch walked behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were right about James, Daddy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, “I know, princess. I tried to make him do the right thing by you and I made a bigger mess. I’m sorry. I should have been honest with you. I liked to imagine my rank had an effect on him. The guy was a wiener.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave me a sideways glance, “A dead wiener?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded quickly, knowing he would want full details when we were completely alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Suffer?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed, “I take you and Servario met?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yup.” I missed him already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s a strange kid too. I like that one though. He came to me when he was twenty-two and asked my permission to date you. I kick myself now for telling him no. I told him the secret was more important. I think he liked you because you were so good at all of this, but telling him no, seemed to make him obsess about you. Well, fat lot of good that did me. Look at where you are. You’ve met him anyway,” he chuckled and I understood something new about Servario. His infatuation with me had been genuine from the beginning, and the challenge of being told no by my father, had only made things worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to save that one for later and looked around, changing the subject, “What is this place?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced around in awe, “This place is perfect for our purpose. It’s a Japanese temple that’s dedicated to a Goddess. There are 123 temple shrines here. This particular one is forbidden access for regular visitors. No one may enter, and then there’s the fact they renovate every twenty years. Anyway, the legend is that a daughter of some guy wandered the woods for twenty years, trying to find the perfect place to worship this goddess. She ended up here in Ise. It’s all rebuilt, every twenty years, to maintain the respect of the order of things. The natural decay cycles. So we can be here, moving in amongst the shrines, staying hidden.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, “Why would the Japanese ever agree to this? They hate Americans, rightfully so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked down on me intensely, “The Fat Man and The Little Boy. After the Second World War they were dedicated to the preservation of the world. Few cultures care about nature and balance like the Japanese do. Once we dropped the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Japanese royals were in. They wanted the immediate control of the weapons that ruined so much of their country. They gave us their most sacred temple as a show of their dedication to the Burrow. They don’t hate Americans, they hate disrespect.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around at the people walking past us. They were multicultural. “So everyone here is a threat to the world in some way?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nudged me, “You have no idea. You guys coming here is a huge mess. I’ll be lucky to get out alive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around, “I can imagine. What have you told the kids?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, “That they’re in Thailand, going to an ashram for meditation. They’re pretty mad at you for picking this as a vacation. I told them it was James’ idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up to see my mom walking down the road. I started to cry again. I ran to her. She wrapped around me, “My baby.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy sister was close behind. She wrapped around mom and me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sissy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook when she hugged me. I knew she would be in the dark. She wouldn’t know and wouldn’t want to. She was a typical hippie from a typical commune on the West Coast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you in some kind of shit,” Sissy whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom gave her a look, “No swearing in the temple.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSis scowled at me, “How did this happen? We’re prisoner here and Dad’s alive? What the heck?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged, “I got nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed, “I see.” She grabbed dad, “You—old man, are in trouble. You broke my heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed, “It was all for you girls. I needed to keep you safe.” He looked at me, “Speaking of which, you have a date with some people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI held my robe to my body and nodded, “I figured something would come of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put a hand out for me. I took it and smiled at my mom and sister, “Be back in a bit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom smirked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe walked up the road, I smelled the blossoming trees and looked around at the beauty of it all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They will make you clean this up or die. That’s the only option.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked up, “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, and the grim look I saw on his face when he first saw me, was back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dad!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, “My hands are tied. James screwed you hard kid. He put you a pickle, I’m not positive you’ll get out of.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to panic but he grabbed both my arms, “But I do know, if anyone is going to get out of it, it’s you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at him, “You think so?” My faith in my survival was dwindling. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-end-of-me-the-single-lady-spy-1/page-39.html","bookId":2264,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:02 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:22:02 PM"}
