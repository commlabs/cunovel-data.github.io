You have to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’ll understand,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood up and started to walk away. “Where are you going? Come back here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe this was a mistake coming here this weekend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quickly got up and walked over to her. “Why would you say that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because you and your family like to do the things I can’t and it’s not fair to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean the things you won’t. Not ‘can’t.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned away from me and didn’t say a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Amelia, look at me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not up for discussion anymore, Collin. This is who I am, and nothing, especially you, is going to change that. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to lie down for a little bit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked back to the house and left me standing on the beach. She was upset and I could see the terror in her eyes when I mentioned the boat. I put my hands in my pockets and walked back to the house. I grabbed a beer from the fridge and sat outside. I wanted to go comfort her, but I could tell she wanted to be alone and I was going to respect that. Her fears were understandable, but she couldn’t stop living life because of the accident and I needed to make her see that. Maybe I was crossing the line, but I cared about her more than I ever cared about anyone in my life and I wasn’t about to sit back and watch her stop living.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA while later, as I was sitting outside, Julia came and sat down next to me. “Where’s Amelia?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She’s lying down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you okay? Did something happen between the two of you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and looked down at my beer bottle. “She’s too afraid to go in the water and she won’t go on the boat. I don’t know what to do about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJulia placed her hand on mine. “You’re going to support her decisions. She’s obviously traumatized by what happened and she should be. I know I would be after experiencing something like that. You haven’t walked in her shoes, little brother, so it’s hard to understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re wrong, Julia. I do understand. I want to help her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You understand as an outsider. You weren’t there. You didn’t see what she did and you certainly didn’t go through what she did. I get that you want to help her, but pushing her to do something she’s not ready for is only going to push her away from you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t say anything. I got up from my chair and kissed Julia on the cheek. “Thanks for the talk. I’m going to go check on her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI quietly opened the door and poked my head in. She turned around and looked at me. I walked in the room and climbed in next to her, wrapping my arms around her and pulling her into me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry, Amelia,” I said as I kissed her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t be. I’m the one with the issues.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We all have issues, baby. Some more than others, but in the end, everyone has issues. But issues can be worked on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can we please not talk about this now?” she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy phone started buzzing. When I reached in my pocket and pulled it out, I noticed a text message from Aiden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bro, I’m in the Hamptons. You here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. I’m at the beach house with Amelia and my family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Awesome. Let’s hit the club tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe that wasn’t such a bad idea, since Amelia wouldn’t go on the boat. I asked her if she wanted to go and she said yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll meet you there around eight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cool. I’m bringing Sonya. I can’t wait for you to meet her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 22\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia and I walked out from our rooms at the same time. I stopped dead in my tracks when I saw her. She looked so sexy, I had to put my hand in my pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wow, you look amazing.” I smiled as I looked her up and down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer short black skirt complemented her long legs and her silvery spaghetti-strap top clung to her hourglass shape. She wore the sides of her hair pinned up with curls cascading down her shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks,” she said as she walked to me and ran her hand down my silk shirt. “So do you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled as I kissed her and we headed downstairs. My family had already taken the boat out, so I grabbed my keys, locked up, and then we drove to the club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dude!” Aiden smiled as he walked up to us right outside the club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, bro,” I said as we high-fived. “This is Amelia. Amelia, this is my best friend, Aiden.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her hand and lightly kissed it. “It’s a pleasure to make your acquaintance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you. It’s nice to meet you,” she replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s Sonya?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We got into an argument and she left. No big deal. There’s plenty of ass in there to look at.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shot him a look. “Aiden, not in front of my girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmelia laughed and told me it was okay. She hooked her arm in mine and Aiden’s and we walked into the club. Aiden turned and mouthed to me, “OH..MY..GOD..YOU..LUCKY..DOG.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe grabbed a table in the corner and Aiden went to the bar and got us a few drinks. He set down Amelia’s glass of wine and handed me my scotch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dude, remember the last time we were here with that pizza delivery girl and you got her off and then she said she was a virgin and not ready for sex? That was classic!” He laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes at the idiocy of my so-called friend. Amelia looked at me and raised her eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That was the night I met you.” I smiled as I took her hand and kissed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry, Amelia. My bad,” Aiden said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe always had a habit of saying the wrong things at the wrong time. Now I was embarrassed and I could tell Amelia was less than pleased. A waitress came over to our table and asked if we needed anything. Amelia held up her glass of wine and ordered another. I ordered another scotch and Dumbass ordered us two rounds of lemon shots. After we downed them, I looked at Amelia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would you like to dance?” I smiled as I held out my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled, put her hand in mine, and we went to the dance floor. She downed her glass of wine pretty fast after the shots and I could tell she was feeling it. She was all over the dance floor. I grasped her hips with my hands and brought her close to me. She began moving her body up and down mine, causing some excitement. I took in a deep breath as I bit my bottom lip to distract me from my hard-on. She turned to me and wrapped her arms around my neck. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-34.html","bookId":1817,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:08:53 PM"}
