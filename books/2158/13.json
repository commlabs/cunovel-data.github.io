Murbella doubted that any other Honored Matre even suspected this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the judgment she attached to her former Sisters. And to myself as I was. A terrible pride. It had grown out of being subjugated so many generations before they gained their own ascendancy. Murbella had tried to convey this to Odrade, recounting from history taught by Honored Matres.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The slave makes an awful master,\" Odrade said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an Honored Matre pattern, Murbella realized. She had accepted it once but now rejected it and could not give all of her reasons for this change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have grown out of those things. They would be childish to me now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan once more had stopped the practice session. Perspiration poured from both teacher and student. They stood panting, regaining breath, an odd exchange of looks between them. Conspiracy? The child looked strangely mature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurbella recalled Odrade\u0027s comment: \"Maturity imposes its own behavior. One of our lessons - make those imperatives available to consciousness. Modify instincts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey have modified me and will do so even more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could see the same thing at work in Duncan\u0027s behavior with the ghola-child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is an activity that creates many stresses in the societies we influence,\" Odrade had said. \"That forces us to constant adjustments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut how can they adjust to my former Sisters?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade revealed characteristic sangfroid when braced with this question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We face major adjustments because of our past activities. It was the same during the reign of the Tyrant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdjustments?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuncan was talking to the child. Murbella moved closer to listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve been exposed to the story of Muad\u0027Dib? Good. You\u0027re an Atreides and that includes flaws.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does that mean mistakes, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re damned right it does! Never choose a course just because it offers the opportunity for a dramatic gesture.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that how I died?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe has the child thinking of his former self in the first person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You be the judge. But it was always an Atreides weakness. Attractive things, gestures. Die on the horns of a great bull as Muad\u0027Dib\u0027s grandfather did. A grand spectacle for his people. The stuff of stories for generations! You can even hear bits of it around after all of these eons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother Superior told me that story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your birth-mother probably told it to you, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe child shuddered. \"It gives me a funny feeling when you say birth-mother.\" Awe in his young voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Funny feelings are one thing; this lesson is another. I\u0027m talking about something with a persistent label: The Desian Gesture. It used to be Atreidesian but that\u0027s too cumbersome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce more the child touched that core of mature awareness. \"Even a dog\u0027s life has its price.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurbella caught her breath, glimpsing how it would be - an adult mind in that child\u0027s body. Disconcerting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your birth-mother was Janet Roxbrough of the Lernaeus Roxbroughs,\" Idaho said. \"She was Bene Gesserit. Your father was Loschy Teg, a CHOAM station factor. In a few minutes I\u0027m going to show you the Bashar\u0027s favorite picture of his home on Lernaeus. I want you to keep it with you and study it. Think of it as your favorite place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeg nodded but the expression on his face said he was afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it possible the great Mentat Warrior had known fear? Murbella shook her head. She had an intellectual knowledge of what Duncan was doing but felt gaps in the accounts. This was something she might never experience. What would the feeling be - reawakening to new life with the memories of another lifetime intact? Much different from a Reverend Mother\u0027s Other Memory, she suspected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mind at its beginning,\" Duncan called it. \"Awakening of your True Self. I felt I had been plunged into a magic universe. My awareness was a circle and then a globe. Arbitrary forms became transient. The table was not a table. Then I fell into a trance - everything around me had a shimmering quality. Nothing was real. This passed and I felt I had lost the one reality. My table was a table once more. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had studied the Bene Gesserit manual \"On Awakening a Ghola\u0027s Original Memories.\" Duncan was diverging from those instructions. Why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left the child and approached Murbella.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to talk to Sheeana,\" he said as he passed her. \"There\u0027s got to be a better way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReady comprehension is often a knee-jerk response and the most dangerous form of understanding. It blinks an opaque screen over your ability to learn. The judgmental precedents of law function that way, littering your path with dead ends. Be warned. Understand nothing. All comprehension is temporary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Mentat Fixe (adacto)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho, seated alone at his console, encountered an entry he had stored in Shipsystems during his first days of confinement, and found himself dumped (he applied the word later) into attitudes and sensory awareness of that earlier time. It no longer was afternoon of a frustrating day in the no-ship. He was back there, stretched between then and now the way serial ghola lives linked this incarnation to his original birth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImmediately, he saw what he had come to call \"the net\" and the elderly couple defined by criss-crossed lines, bodies visible through a shimmering of jeweled ropes - green, blue, gold, and a silver so brilliant it made his eyes ache.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sensed godlike stability in these people, but something common about them. The word ordinary came to mind. The by-now-familiar garden landscape stretched out behind them: floral bushes (roses, he thought), rolling lawns, tall trees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe couple stared back at him with an intensity that made Idaho feel naked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew power in the vision! It no longer was confined to the Great Hold, an increasingly compulsive magnet drawing him down there so frequently he knew the watchdogs were alerted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs he another Kwisatz Haderach?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a level of suspicion the Bene Gesserit could achieve that would kill him if it grew. And they were watching him now! Questions, worried speculations. Despite this, he could not turn away from the vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did that elderly couple look so familiar? Someone from his past? Family?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMentat riffling of his memories produced nothing to fit the speculation. Round faces. Abbreviated chins. Fat wrinkles at the jowls. Dark eyes. The net obscured their color. The woman wore a long blue and green dress that concealed her feet. A white apron stained with green covered the dress from ample bosom to just below her waist. Garden tools dangled from apron loops. She carried a trowel in her left hand. Her hair was gray. Wisps of it had escaped a confining green scarf and blew around her eyes, emphasizing laughter lines there. She appeared... grandmotherly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man suited her as though created by the same artist as a perfect match. Bib overalls over a mounded stomach. No hat. Those same dark eyes with reflections twinkling in them. A brush of close-cropped wiry gray hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had the most benign expression Idaho had ever seen. Up-curved smile creases at the corners of his mouth. He held a small shovel in his left hand, and on his extended right palm he balanced what appeared to be a small metal ball. The ball emitted a piercing whistle that made Idaho clap his hands over his ears. This did not stop the sound. It faded away of itself. He lowered his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReassuring faces. That thought aroused Idaho\u0027s suspicions because now he recognized the familiarity. They looked somewhat like Face Dancers, even to the pug noses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned forward but the vision kept its distance. \"Face Dancers,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNet and elderly couple vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were replaced by Murbella in practice-floor leotards of glistening ebony. He had to reach out and touch her before he could believe she really stood there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Duncan? What is it? You\u0027re all sweaty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... think it\u0027s something the damned Tleilaxu planted in me. I keep seeing... I think they\u0027re Face Dancers. They... they look at me and just now... a whistle. It hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced up at the comeyes but did not appear worried. This was something the Sisters could know without it presenting immediate dangers... except possibly to Scytale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sank to her haunches beside him and put a hand on his arm. \"Something they did to your body in the tanks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you said...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My body\u0027s not just a piece of new baggage for this trip. It has all of the chemistry and substance I ever had. It\u0027s my mind that\u0027s different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat worried her. She knew the Bene Gesserit concern over wild talents. \"Damn that Scytale!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll find it,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes and heard Murbella stand. Her hand went away from his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you shouldn\u0027t do that, Duncan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sounded far away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMemory. Where did they hide the secret thing? Deep in the original cells? Until this moment, he had thought of his memory as a Mentat tool. He could call up his own images from long-ago moments in front of mirrors. Close up, examining an age wrinkle. Looking at a woman behind him - two faces in the mirror and his face full of questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaces. A succession of masks, different views of this person he called myself. Slightly imbalanced faces. Hair sometimes gray, sometimes the jet karakul of his current life. Sometimes humorous, sometimes grave and seeking inward for wisdom to meet a new day. Somewhere in all of that lay a consciousness that observed and deliberated. Someone who made choices. The Tleilaxu had tampered with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdaho felt his blood pumping hard and knew danger was present. This was what he was intended to experience... but not by the Tleilaxu. He had been born with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is what it means to be alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo memory from his other lives, nothing the Tleilaxu had done to him, none of that changed his deepest awareness one whit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened his eyes. Murbella still stood near but her expression was veiled. So that\u0027s how she will look as a Reverend Mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not like this change in her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happens if the Bene Gesserit fail?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she did not reply, he nodded. Yes. That\u0027s the worst assumption. The Sisterhood down history\u0027s sewerpipe. And you don\u0027t want that, my beloved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could see it in her face when she turned and left him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking up at the comeyes, he said: \"Dar. I must talk to you, Dar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo response from any of the mechanisms around him. He had not expected one. Still, he knew he could talk to her and she would have to listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been coining at our problem from the other direction,\" he said. And he imagined the busy whirring of recorders as they spun the sounds of his voice into ridulian crystals. \"I\u0027ve been getting into the minds of Honored Matres. I know I\u0027ve done it. Murbella resonates.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would alert them. He had an Honored Matre of his own. But had was not the proper word. He did not have Murbella. Not even in bed. They had each other. Matched the way those people in his vision appeared to be matched. Was that what he saw there? Two older people sexually trained by Honored Matres?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I look at another issue now,\" he said. \"How to overcome the Bene Gesserit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat threw down the gauntlet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Episodes,\" he said. A word Odrade was fond of using.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s how we have to see what\u0027s happening to us. Little episodes. Even the worst-case assumption has to be screened against that background. The Scattering has a magnitude that dwarfs anything we do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere! That demonstrated his value to the Sisters. It put Honored Matres in a better perspective. They were back here in the Old Empire. Fellow dwarves. He knew Odrade would see it. Bell would make her see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere out there in the Infinite Universe, a jury had brought in a verdict against Honored Matres. Law and its managers had not prevailed for the hunters. He suspected that his vision had shown him two of the jurors. And if they were Face Dancers, they were not Scytale\u0027s Face Dancers. Those two people behind the shimmering net belonged to no one but themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMajor flaws in government arise from a fear of making radical internal changes even though a need is clearly seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Darwi Odrade\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Odrade, the first melange of the morning was always different. Her flesh responded like a starveling who clutched at sweet fruit. Then followed the slow, penetrating and painful restoration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the fearful thing about melange addiction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood at the window of her sleeping chamber waiting for the effect to run its course. Weather Control, she noted, had achieved another morning rain. The landscape was washed clean, everything immersed in a romantic haze, all edges blurred and reduced to essences like old memories. She opened the window. Damp cold air blew across her face, drawing recollections around her the way one put on a familiar garment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe inhaled deeply. Smells after a rain! She remembered the essentials of life amplified and smoothed by falling water but these rains were different. They left a flinty aftersmell she could taste. Odrade did not like it. The message was not of things washed clean but of life resentful, wanting all rain stopped and locked away. This rain no longer gentled and brought fullness. It carried inescapable awareness of change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade closed the window. At once, she was back in the familiar odors of her quarters, and that constant smell of shere from the metering implants required of everyone who knew the location of Chapterhouse. She heard Streggi enter, the slip-slip sounds of the desert map being changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn efficient sound in Streggi\u0027s movements. Weeks of close association had confirmed Odrade\u0027s first judgment. Reliable. Not brilliant but supremely sensitive to Mother Superior\u0027s needs. Look how quietly she moved. Transfer Streggi\u0027s sensitivity to the needs of young Teg and they had his required height and mobility. A horse? Much more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade\u0027s melange assimilation reached its peak and subsided. Streggi\u0027s reflection in the window showed her waiting for assignment. She knew these moments were given over to the spice. At her stage, she would be looking forward to the day when she entered this mysterious enhancement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wish her well of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost Reverend Mothers followed the teaching and seldom thought of their spice as addiction. Odrade knew it every morning for what it was. You took your spice during the day as your body demanded, following a pattern of early training: dosage minimal, just enough to whet the metabolic system and drive it into peak performance. Biological necessities meshed more smoothly with melange. Food tasted better. Barring accident or fatal assault, you lived much longer than you could without it. But you were addicted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer body restored, Odrade blinked and considered Streggi. Curiosity about the morning\u0027s long ritual was plain in her. Speaking to Streggi\u0027s reflection in the window, Odrade said: \"Have you learned about melange withdrawal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Mother Superior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite warnings to keep awareness of addiction low key, it was never more than an eyeblink away from Odrade and she felt the accumulated resentments. Mental preparations as an acolyte (firmly impressed in the Agony) had been eroded by Other Memory and accumulations of time. The admonition: \"Withdrawal removes an essential of your life and, if it occurs in late middle age, can kill you.\" How little that meant now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Withdrawal has intense meaning for me,\" Odrade said. \"I am one of those for whom the morning melange is painful. I\u0027m sure they told you this happens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Mother Superior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade studied the map. It showed a longer finger of desert thrusting northward and a pronounced widening of drylands to the southeast of Central where Sheeana had her station. Presently, Odrade returned her attention to Streggi, who was watching Mother Superior with new interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrought up short by thoughts of the spice\u0027s darker side!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The uniqueness of melange is seldom considered in our age,\" Odrade said. \"All of the old narcotics in which humans have indulged possess a remarkable factor in common - all except the spice. They all brought shorter life and pain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We were told, Mother Superior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you probably were not told that a fact of governance could be obscured by our concern with Honored Matres. There\u0027s an energy greed in governments (yes, even in ours) that can dump you into a trap. If you serve me, you will feel it in your guts because every morning you will watch me suffer. Let knowledge of it sink into you, this deadly trap. Don\u0027t become uncaring pushers, caught in a system that displaces life with careless death as Honored Matres do. Remember: Acceptable narcotics can be taxed to pay salaries or otherwise create jobs for uncaring functionaries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStreggi was puzzled. \"But melange extends our lives, increases health and arouses appetites for -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was stopped by Odrade\u0027s scowl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight out of the Acolyte Manual!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has this other side, Streggi, and you see it in me. The Acolyte Manual does not lie. But melange is a narcotic and we are addicted. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" I know it\u0027s not gentle with everyone, Mother Superior. But you said Honored Matres don\u0027t use it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The substitute they employ replaces melange with few benefits except to prevent withdrawal agonies and death. It is parallel addictive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the captive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Murbella used it and now she uses melange. They are interchangeable. Interesting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... suppose we will learn more of this. I notice, Mother Superior, that you never call them whores.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As acolytes do? Ahh, Streggi, Bellonda has been a bad influence. Oh, I recognize the pressures.\" As Streggi started to protest. \"Acolytes feel the threat. They look at Chapterhouse and think of it as their fortress for the long night of the whores.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something like that, Mother Superior.\" Extremely hesitant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Streggi, this planet is only another temporary place. Today we go south and impress that upon you. Find Tamalane, please, and tell her to make the arrangements we discussed for our visit to Sheeana. Speak to no one else about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Mother Superior. Do you mean I will accompany you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you by my side. Tell the one you are training that she now has full charge of my map.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Streggi left, Odrade thought of Sheeana and Idaho. She wants to talk to him and he wants to talk to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComeye analysis noted that these two sometimes conversed by hand-signals while hiding most of the movements with their bodies. It had the look of an old Atreides battle language. Odrade recognized some of it but not enough to determine content. Bellonda wanted an explanation from Sheeana. \"Secrets!\" Odrade was more cautious. \"Let it go a bit. Perhaps something interesting will come of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat does Sheeana want?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever Duncan had in mind it concerned Teg. Creating the pain required for Teg to recover his original memories went against Duncan\u0027s grain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade had noted this when she interrupted Duncan at his console yesterday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re late, Dar.\" Not looking up from whatever it was he did there. Late? It was early evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been calling her Dar frequently for several years, a goad, a reminder that he resented his fishtank existence. The goad irritated Bellonda, who argued against \"his damned familiarities.\" He called Bellonda \"Bell,\" of course. Duncan was generous with his needle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemembering this, Odrade paused before entering her workroom. Duncan had slammed a fist onto the counter beside his console. \"There\u0027s got to be a better way for Teg!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA better way? What does he have in mind?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMovement down the corridor beyond the workroom brought her out of this reflection. Streggi returning from Tamalane. Streggi entered the Acolyte Ready Room. Giving the word to her replacement on the desert map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA stack of Archival records waited on Odrade\u0027s table. Bellonda! Odrade stared at the pile. No matter how much she tried to delegate there was always this organized residue that her councillors insisted only Mother Superior could handle. Much of this new lot came from Bellonda\u0027s demand for \"suggestions and analyses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade touched her console. \"Bell!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice of an Archives clerk responded: \"Mother Superior?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get Bell up here! I want her in front of me as fast as her fat legs can move!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was less than a minute. Bellonda stood in front of the worktable like a chastened acolyte. They all knew that tone in Mother Superior\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade touched the stack on her table and jerked her hand back as though shocked. \"What in the name of Shaitan is all of that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We judged it significant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I have to see everything and anything? Where\u0027s the keynoting? This is sloppy work, Bell! I\u0027m not stupid and neither are you. But this... in the face of this...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I delegate as much as -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Delegate? Look at this! Which must I see and which may I delegate? Not one keynote!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll see that it\u0027s corrected immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed you will, Bell. Because Tam and I are going south today, an unannounced inspection tour and a visit with Sheeana. And while I\u0027m gone, you will sit in my chair. See how you like this daily deluge!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you be out of touch?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have a lightline and Ear-C at all times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellonda breathed easier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" I suggest, Bell, that you get back to Archives and put someone in charge who will take responsibility. I\u0027m damned if you\u0027re not beginning to act like bureaucrats. Covering your asses!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Real boats rock, Dar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas that Bell attempting humor? All was not lost!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade waved a hand over her projector and there was Tamalane in the Transport Hall. \"Tam?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\" Without turning from an assignment list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How soon can we leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About two hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call me when you\u0027re ready. Oh, and Streggi goes with us. Make room for her.\" Odrade blanked the projection before Tamalane could respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were things she should be doing, Odrade knew. Tam and Bell were not the only sources of Mother Superior\u0027s concerns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSixteen planets remaining to us... and that includes Buzzell, definitely a place in peril. Only sixteen! She pushed that thought aside. No time for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurbella. Should I call her and... No. That can wait. The new Board of Proctors? Let Bell deal with that. Community disbandings?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSiphoning personnel into a new Scattering had forced consolidations. Staying ahead of the desert! It was depressing and she did not feel she could face it today. I\u0027m always fidgety before a trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbruptly, Odrade fled the workroom and went stalking the corridors, looking into how her charges were performing, pausing in doorways, noting what the students read, how they behaved in their everlasting prana-bindu exercises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you reading there?\" demanded of a young second-stage acolyte at a projector in a semi-darkened room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The diaries of Tolstoy, Mother Superior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat knowing look in the acolyte\u0027s eyes said: \"Do you have his words directly in Other Memory?\" The question was right there on the edge of the girl\u0027s tongue! They were always trying such petty gambits when they caught her alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tolstoy was a family name!\" Odrade snapped. \"By your mention of diaries, I presume you refer to Count Leo Nikolayevich.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Mother Superior.\" Abashedly aware of censure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoftening, Odrade threw a quotation at the girl: \" \u0027I am not a river, I am a net.\u0027 He spoke those words at Yasnaya Polyana when he was only twelve. You\u0027ll not find them in his diaries but they are probably the most significant words he ever uttered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade turned away before the acolyte could thank her. Always teaching!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wandered down to the main kitchens then and inspected them, tracing inner edges of racked pots for grease, noting the cautious way even the teaching chef observed her progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kitchen was steamy with good smells from lunch preparations. There was a restorative sound of chopping and stirring but the usual banter stopped at her entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went around the long counter with its busy cooks to the teaching chef\u0027s raised platform. He was a great beefy man with prominent cheekbones, his face as florid as the meats over which he ministered. Odrade had no doubts he was one of history\u0027s great chefs. His name suited him: Placido Salat. He was assured of a warm place in her thoughts for several reasons, including the fact that he had trained her personal chef. Important visitors in the days before Honored Matres had received a kitchen tour and a taste of specialties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I introduce our senior chef, Placido Salat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis beef placido (lower case his choice) was the envy of many. Almost raw and served with an herbed and spicy mustard sauce that did not obscure the meat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade thought the dish too exotic but never judged it aloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she had Salat\u0027s full attention (after a slight interruption to correct a sauce) Odrade said: \"I\u0027m hungry for something special, Placido.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe recognized the opening. This was how she always began a request for her \"special dish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps an oyster stew,\" he suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s a dance, Odrade thought. They both knew what she wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excellent!\" she agreed and went into the required performance. \"But it must be treated gently, Placido, the oysters not overcooked. Some of our own powdered dry celery in the broth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And perhaps a bit of paprika?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I always prefer it that way. Be extremely careful with the melange. A breath of it and no more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, Mother Superior!\" Eyes rolling in horror at the thought he might use too much melange. \"So easy for the spice to dominate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cook the oysters in clam nectar, Placido. I would prefer you watch over them yourself, stirring gently until the edges of the oysters just start to curl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a second longer, Mother Superior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heat some quite creamy milk on the side. Don\u0027t boil it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlacido displayed astonishment that she might suspect him of boiling the milk for her oyster stew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A small pat of butter in the serving bowl,\" Odrade said. \"Pour the combined broth over it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No sherry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How glad I am that you are taking personal charge of my special dish, Placido. I forgot the sherry.\" (Mother Superior never forgot anything and they all knew it but this was a required step in the dance.) \"Three ounces of sherry in the cooking broth,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heat it to get rid of the alcohol.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course! But we must not bruise the flavors. Would you like croutons or saltines?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Croutons, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeated at an alcove table, Odrade ate two bowls of oyster stew, remembering how Sea Child had savored it. Papa had introduced her to this dish when she was barely capable of conveying spoon to mouth. He had made the stew himself, his own specialty. Odrade had taught it to Salat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe complimented Salat on the wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I particularly enjoyed your choice of a chablis for accompaniment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A flinty chablis with a sharp edge on it, Mother Superior. One of our better vintages. It sets off the oyster flavors admirably.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTamalane found her in the alcove. They always knew where to find Mother Superior when they wanted her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We are ready.\" Was that displeasure on Tam\u0027s face?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where will we stop tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eldio.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade smiled. She liked Eldio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTam catering to me because I\u0027m in a critical mood? Perhaps we have the makings of a small diversion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing Tamalane to the transport docks, Odrade thought how characteristic it was that the older woman preferred to travel by tube. Surface trips annoyed her. \"Who wants to waste time at my age?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade disliked tubes for personal transport. You were so closed in and helpless! She preferred surface or air and used tubes only when speed was urgent. She had no hesitation about using smaller tubes for chits and notes. Notes don\u0027t care just as long as they get there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis thought always made her conscious of the network that adjusted to her movements wherever she went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere in the heart of things (there was always a \"heart of things\") an automated system routed communications and made sure (most of the time) that important missives arrived where addressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Private Dispatch (they all called it PD) was not needed, stat or viz was available along scrambled sorters and lightlines. Off-planet was another matter, especially in these hunted times. Safest to send a Reverend Mother with memorized message or distrans implant. Every messenger took heavier doses of shere these days. T-probes could read even a dead mind not guarded by shere. Every off-planet message was encrypted but an enemy might hit on the one-time cover concealing it. Great risk off-planet. Perhaps that was why the Rabbi remained silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow why am I thinking such things at this moment?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No word yet from Dortujla?\" she asked as Tamalane prepared to enter the Dispatch roundelay where the others in their party waited. So many people. Why so many?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade saw Streggi up ahead at the edge of the dock talking to a Communications acolyte. There were at least six other people from Communications nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTamalane turned in obvious pique. \"Dortujla! We have all said we will notify you the instant we hear!\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/chapterhouse-dune-dune-chronicles-6/page-13.html","bookId":2158,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:19 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:19 PM"}
