{"id":109347,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"\u003cp\u003eI stood there for several long seconds, staring at Shaya but not really seeing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" I said at last, my voice unnaturally flat even to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated, eyes worried. \"Is there...is there anything I can get for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore wine, I thought. But I shook my head. Wine suddenly didn\u0027t seem strong enough. I wanted to go home just then and raid my liquor cabinet, seeking solace in my own home and its bed, not this godforsaken Dark Ages fortress. The wine was going to make transitioning between the worlds harder, though. It wasn\u0027t impossible but would hardly be as smooth as usual. No, it seemed I might be stuck here for a while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to see Volusian,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped aside for me, and though I didn\u0027t ask for it, she followed me solicitously as I headed downstairs, down to the keep\u0027s dungeon. It seemed darker and drearier than it had last time, but maybe that was the wine. Jasmine\u0027s cell was easy to spot because four guards stood in the hall outside it. I reached it, and through the bars, I saw Volusian standing in one corner, perfectly still, with his arms crossed over his chest. Jasmine sat as absolutely far from him as she could, her face equal parts fear and sullenness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want now?\" she snapped. I didn\u0027t even look at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Volusian,\" I said. \"I have an errand for you. I\u0027ll watch Jasmine while you\u0027re gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVolusian walked forward, passing through the bars and coming to stand in front of me. \"No doubt my mistress has a more urgent task.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Moderately. I want you to go back to Tucson and bring me the bottle of tequila I keep in my liquor cabinet. And don\u0027t scare Tim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVolusian remained motionless in that way of his. \"My mistress grows increasingly creative in her ways to torment me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you\u0027d appreciate it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only in so much as it inspires me to equally creative means to rip you apart when I am able to break free of these bonds and finally destroy you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see? There\u0027s a silver lining to everything. Now hurry up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVolusian vanished. With him gone, Jasmine grew bolder. She hurried to the front of the cell, holding the bronze bars as best she could with her bound hands. \"When are you going to let me go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat down against the hall\u0027s wall, opposite her. I wondered if she\u0027d try any of her stunted magic with me around. \"When are you going to stop asking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a real bitch, you know that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, little girl,\" I growled. \"You do not want to mess with me tonight. I\u0027m not in a good mood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasmine was undeterred. \"I can\u0027t believe you\u0027re keeping me in here with that...that thing! That\u0027s just cruel and sadistic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow, sadistic\u0027s kind of a big word. I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d stayed in school long enough to learn that kind of vocabulary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer glower darkened. \"When I get out, I\u0027m going to kill you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you and \u0027that thing\u0027 should get along beautifully, seeing as he spends all his time plotting my grisly death too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded down to her bound hands. \"I can barely feed myself, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Barely isn\u0027t the same as can\u0027t.\" But I did feel a little bad about that. Was I really going to keep her in cuffs forever? Yet, how could I not? Maybe I should investigate that potion Rurik had told me about. No...that wasn\u0027t right either. I sighed, and spent the next half-hour listening to her alternate between insults and whining. It was better than thinking about Kiyo, though. All the while, I was sobering up, so when Volusian finally appeared and handed me over a full bottle of Jose Cuervo, I gave silent thanks that I\u0027d purchased an extra-large bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I said, rising to my feet. I pointed to Jasmine\u0027s cell. \"Now-back to guard duty.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned around without a second glance, Jasmine\u0027s cries of outrage echoing behind me. Shaya, who had waited silently the whole time, fell in step with me as I walked back upstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure there isn\u0027t anything I can do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI eyed the bottle. \"See if you can find some little glasses about this big.\" I held my fingers out to the size of a shot glass. \"And bring enough for...I don\u0027t know. You, Rurik...hell, anyone who wants to get drunk with me. Even Ysabel.\" I was feeling magnanimous tonight. Or, well, at least in a misery-loves-company mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaya\u0027s face looked more troubled than ever, but I paid it little concern as I walked outside to a small circular courtyard in the castle\u0027s center. This seemed to be a fixture in most gentry holdings. Dorian had a couple. I\u0027d been told that this one had been green in Aeson\u0027s time, filled with lilies and lilacs. Now, it was sandy and gravelly, lined with cacti, mesquite, and even some of the thorn trees that had given the land its name. At least the mesquite scented the air, and I decided one perk of the Otherworld was that those trees always seemed to be in bloom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat down cross-legged in the middle of the courtyard, noticing that someone had started to set stone tiles into it to create a kind of patio area. It hadn\u0027t been there last time, and I wondered if it was Shaya\u0027s doing, just like the patches of grass she kept trying to grow around here. Not waiting for shot glasses, I uncapped the tequila and took a long swig, the strong liquor burning my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaya returned shortly, Rurik following. His face was uncharacteristically serious. After a brief moment of exchanged looks, they joined me on the tiled ground. Shaya set down some tiny cups made of engraved silver. Not quite shot glasses, but they would do. I took the bottle and filled three of them up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To the Willow Queen and her child,\" I said, holding my cup in the air. I downed it one gulp. \"Damn. Wish I had some salt and lime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaya and Rurik exchanged glances once more-did they honestly think I didn\u0027t notice each time?-and then followed my lead with the tequila. Rurik took his down stoically, but Shaya choked on hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What...what is this?\" she asked, once she was able to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God\u0027s favorite liquor. I should have had Volusian run to the grocery store and get some margarita mix while he was out.\" I paused, laughing at the thought. I poured another shot. \"It\u0027s made from a kind of cactus, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShaya eyed the bottle askance. \"Truly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup. Huh. I wonder if we could manufacture this stuff. I\u0027ve seen agave around. I bet we could set up some serious trade with it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not so certain,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRurik was pouring another glass. \"I don\u0027t know. It might appeal to some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, Rurik. I knew we were kindred spirits.\" I held up my empty shot glass, studying the way the half-moon\u0027s light shone on it. My head was regaining its pleasant buzz again. \"Do you think Maiwenn\u0027s going to have a boy or a girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" said Shaya after several moments of silence. \"There are those who can magically determine such things. But I haven\u0027t heard of the Willow Queen doing that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably not.\" Kiyo would have told me. Or would he have? Maybe he would have held on to that news, keeping it as a special secret between him and Maiwenn. I poured another shot but didn\u0027t drink it yet. Shitfaced was one thing; sick was another. \"Back in my world, they would have known its gender a long time ago. They also would have been able to tell all sorts of things-its size, if it had any diseases, even if it was twins or triplets. There\u0027s this machine we\u0027ve got. You run a paddle over the mother\u0027s stomach, and then you can see the baby up on this screen. Or, sometimes, even earlier, they can take a needle and suck up amniotic fluid to find out the same things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRurik and Shaya were staring at me wide-eyed. It was a common expression amongst Otherworldly denizens whenever I began talking about human technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wonder sometimes if there\u0027s any mystery or wonder left in your world at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced over and saw Ysabel\u0027s form silhouetted in the doorway to the castle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, sure. Plenty of it.\" I gestured her over. \"Come have a drink. I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027m too drunk to kill anyone tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYsabel hesitated a few seconds and then slowly walked over, sitting near Rurik and Shaya, as far from me as she could respectfully go. She grimaced slightly at the tiles as she tucked her flowing silk skirts underneath her. No doubt being on the ground went against her fastidious nature. Rurik cheerfully handed her a tequila shot. She sniffed it, and her scowl returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mind was still on babies. \"Seems like ultrasounds would be useful to you guys. I mean, what with the trouble you have having kids.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a good chance, I knew, that Maiwenn might not even survive the delivery. Or that her child wouldn\u0027t. It was common among the gentry, sort of the cost for their long and healthy lives. I didn\u0027t know how I felt about that. I didn\u0027t wish death on either of them...and yet, how much simpler would things be if there was no Maiwenn and no baby? Even now, I could picture Kiyo by her side, holding her hand. His handsome face would be lined with worry as he spoke words of encouragement. Surely, with his human blood, their baby would be healthy and strong. And Maiwenn was a healer.... would that be useful to herself? Maybe. Everything would go well, I was certain, and they\u0027d undoubtedly have a beautiful baby, one that would create a bond between them forever, a bond I could never be a part of....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drank my next shot and noticed that Ysabel had manfully downed hers. \"Nice work,\" I said. \"You want another?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"I don\u0027t consider it ladylike to drown oneself in excess, losing hold of inhibitions and all sense of decorum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you don\u0027t,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe,\" she added primly, \"that the Willow Queen shares my views.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, spinning my cup on the ground, watching in fascination as it turned in smaller and smaller circles before coming to a stop. With Maiwenn\u0027s baby consuming my thoughts, Ysabel\u0027s baiting seemed insignificant tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe continued on for a while, Rurik keeping up with me in shots, with Shaya only occasionally indulging. Ysabel seemed to have lost her fear of me and continued her running commentary of barbed remarks. I think knowing I was in a fragile state over Maiwenn\u0027s labor had emboldened her. In fact, she was in the middle of some anecdote about how Kiyo and Maiwenn had first gotten involved when her words came to a halt, and her features lit up with surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My lord!\" she cried, springing up just as one of my servants began announcing, \"His royal majesty, King Dorian, of the House of Arkady, caller of earth-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDorian strode forward into the courtyard without waiting for his titles to finish. Ysabel fell to her knees before him, face radiant. \"My lord!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave her a brief nod of acknowledgment and then swept on past her toward me. I don\u0027t think anyone except me saw the devastation that filled her face over the slight. Shaya and Rurik began to rise out of courtesy, but Dorian quickly motioned them down. Unfastening his cloak-it appeared to be navy in the moonlight-he spread it on the ground and sat beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, well, a party, and no one invited me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was kind of impromptu,\" I said, reaching over to pour him a shot. My hand trembled as I held the bottle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDorian took it from me and finished pouring. He eyed me carefully. \"And yet, it appears to have been going on for some time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. We\u0027re toasting the birth of the next king or queen of the Willow Land.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I\u0027ve heard, which is why I came to see how the news was received here.\" Dorian tossed back the tequila. His eyebrows rose in surprise at the taste, but it didn\u0027t stop him from pouring another. \"And don\u0027t presume her child will inherit. It all depends on strength and power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words reminded me distantly of Leith\u0027s own inheritance problems, which then reminded me of Leith\u0027s declaration of love. Ugh. I\u0027d probably killed our one chance at engineering help. Well, that was a concern for another day. \"How\u0027d you get here so fast?\" I asked Dorian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not that fast. I heard hours ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHours ago. Dorian had found out before I had. Probably everyone had. Who was I, after all? Certainly no one who was connected to this birth. I was just another monarch who\u0027d be expected to send jewels or tapestries when the baby was born. I poured another shot, but Shaya reached for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I have another?\" She wasn\u0027t a fan of this stuff, but I had a feeling she wanted to stop me from drinking any more. Oh, well. There appeared to be about one more shot in the bottle-though Dorian beat me to that one too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll make yourself sick,\" I warned, reaching for the bottle. Only a few drops poured into my cup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll take my chances. This is a fascinating substance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It comes from cacti,\" I said helpfully, hoping it might deter him from that last shot. It didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Intriguing,\" he said after downing it. \"You should try producing it here. I\u0027m certain a number of people would trade for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t be certain in the near-darkness, but it looked like Shaya rolled her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of me resented Dorian\u0027s presence, though I had to admit that he did a good job in keeping the subject away from Maiwenn and Kiyo. That didn\u0027t stop me from thinking about them, of course, but I couldn\u0027t help but smile as he entertained the others. Whether it was part of being a king or just something inherently Dorian, he had a powerful charisma about him that could make everyone laugh and stay captivated. With my social reticence, his were skills I admired-and occasionally envied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the night wore on, though, I could feel the tequila\u0027s effects lessening a little. That wasn\u0027t to say I still wasn\u0027t drunk as hell; I\u0027d taken down half that bottle myself. But, I wanted to go to bed while I was still in that delirious haze. It didn\u0027t stop me from feeling down over Kiyo, but I had to imagine being sober would be worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone stood up when I did, and I felt my legs struggle for balance. \"Let me assist you,\" said Shaya, reaching toward me. Dorian intervened before she could help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, no. Allow me to guide the Thorn Queen to her room. I\u0027d like a few words.\" Ysabel\u0027s face darkened at this, and he gave her a chastising look. \"Oh, stop it. I\u0027ll come to you shortly-provided Eugenie will allow me to stay overnight in her castle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, sure,\" I said. \"Come on over. Make yourself at home. Pick out curtains.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe extended his arm to me, and I decided the indignity of letting Dorian guide me was less than that of me falling over in front of my servants. Ysabel\u0027s eyes followed us furiously, and I couldn\u0027t blame her. If my boyfriend were taking a drunk woman to her bedroom, I\u0027d be pissed too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was very high-handed of you to think I needed your moral support,\" I told him once we were out of earshot of the others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. You only need the moral support of a bottle,\" he teased. \"Be honest, Eugenie. Your lover\u0027s at the side of a former lover, eagerly awaiting the birth of their child. I\u0027d be distressed as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing distresses you,\" I grumbled. We reached my room, and he followed me in without invitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plenty of things do,\" he said. He frowned, ever so slightly, and it occurred to me he was none too sober himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let go of his arm and walked over to the full-length mirror that stood on one side of the room, edged in gold. I\u0027d pinned up my hair earlier and let it down now, wondering if I wanted to bother with sending Nia for a nightgown or if I\u0027d just sleep in my clothes. Standing there, I stared at my body, thinking again of my mother\u0027s claims that I was too skinny. I always argued it was an athletic build. Running my hands over the sides of my stomach and down to my hips, I studied my figure. Whatever you wanted to call it, it was slim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can never do that for him,\" I said in a small voice. \"I can never give him a baby like she can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDorian strolled over and stood behind me, meeting my eyes in the mirror. \"Do you want to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Kids were never on my radar...it was always a \u0027maybe someday\u0027 kind of thing. But now...knowing I can\u0027t...\" My hips and stomach suddenly seemed as unhealthily skinny as my mother had always said. They would remain untouched and infertile, never filling out with the kind of life Maiwenn\u0027s had. I would never share that with Kiyo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flinched as Dorian reached from behind and placed his hands on the narrowest part of my waist. He rested his head on my shoulder, and I was too weary to shoo him away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You speak like someone who\u0027s been condemned with infertility or like you\u0027ve passed your prime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I might as well be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not true. You\u0027re young. You radiate health and fertility. You could have a dozen children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head slowly. \"I can\u0027t,\" I said sadly. \"I won\u0027t. You know I won\u0027t, no matter how much you and every other Otherworldly creature want me to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you\u0027d have a daughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t take the risk.\" I knew I\u0027d never be confiding in him sober. \"And what if Kiyo decides he doesn\u0027t want that-to be with someone who\u0027s always going to be childless? What if he wants more kids? Maybe this baby...Maybe he\u0027ll go back to Maiwenn. Maybe...maybe he\u0027ll leave me....\" I could feel tears forming in my eyes and hated myself for the weakness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDorian tightened his grip on my waist. \"He\u0027d be a fool. And you\u0027d be a fool to mourn him if he did. You\u0027re more than a childbearing vessel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not the way everyone talks. Not the way you talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my shock, Dorian spun me around. Still gripping me, he pressed his forehead to mine so that only an inch was between us. I could smell the tequila on his breath, no doubt mirroring my own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eugenie, you\u0027re a woman without equal, and no matter how much you annoy the hell out of me and no matter how much I try to get you out of my head-and believe me, both occur regularly-I can\u0027t stay away from you. Even if you were barren, I\u0027d take you as my consort in an instant and spend the rest of my life with you-childless, so long as it meant you\u0027d be by my side. I would gladly bring you to my bed with no other thoughts than taking joy from your body. It would be enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed. \"But you\u0027re with...I mean, what about...what about Ysabel? She can have kids....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ysabel,\" he said dismissively, \"is nothing. A pale imitation of you-and not even a good one at that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was harsh of him, but it filled me with something warm and loved and special. I realized then that no matter the bantering, sexual tension, and many schemes, Dorian really was my friend. I also realized that I wanted so badly then for him to kiss me, to crush his body against mine and run his hands along my bare skin. I wanted to have sex with him against the wall, on the bed, on the floor...it honestly didn\u0027t matter, so long as our bodies were joined, and I could feel him in me....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoa. I jerked away, my heart racing, barely stopping myself from doing something I\u0027d regret. Deciding he was my friend was one thing; jumping into bed was another. I knew it was the tequila and my worry over Kiyo causing this. I didn\u0027t want to be with Dorian again; I couldn\u0027t be. Even if he claimed it would be for love and pleasure, I knew it could never be that simple. There would always be politics and schemes....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so, I did the most unsexy thing I could. I summoned Volusian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe icy, dark presence of my minion caught even Dorian by surprise, and he took a step back. It was the Otherworldly equivalent of a cold shower. Volusian\u0027s eyes flicked to him and then turned back to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mistress requires more intoxication,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" My magical hold on him trembled ever so slightly. It was nowhere near enough for me to lose control, but the alcohol messed with my power a bit. \"I wanted you to go to the Willow Land and see if there\u0027s any news.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More romantic errands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just go,\" I snapped, trying to sound as harsh and commanding as I could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Volusian was gone, Dorian strode angrily to me, all traces of sensuality gone. \"That was stupid, Eugenie. You shouldn\u0027t have summoned him after drinking so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned away from him. \"I need to find out what\u0027s going on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to banish him. You\u0027re going to regret keeping him someday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s useful,\" I protested. \"I don\u0027t need any lectures. You should go to Ysabel now. I don\u0027t need any more declarations of love today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\" His light tone returned. \"Had a few of those today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Leith,\" I admitted. \"He came by tonight to profess his undying devotion and see if he had a chance with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDorian\u0027s green eyes watched me carefully. \"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And, of course not. I had to tell him no a few times before he finally got it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDorian didn\u0027t bother hiding his satisfaction. \"You\u0027ve broken the poor boy\u0027s heart. And his mother\u0027s, no doubt. There\u0027ll be no ball now. Would you like me to throw one instead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" My sadness was turning into irritability. \"I want you to leave. Go to Ysabel and paint her or tie her up or whatever it is you do together. I\u0027m tired and want to go to bed. Alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo my surprise, Dorian didn\u0027t protest. Much. \"As you wish. If you need me, you know where I\u0027ll be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would take a lot for me to interrupt you,\" I said dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDorian gave me one of his knowing, sly smiles and then left without another word. The thought of him going to Ysabel\u0027s bed troubled me more than I would have liked. He\u0027d barely been gone a few minutes when Volusian returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" I asked. My stomach was queasy. I didn\u0027t know what I wanted to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf it was in Volusian\u0027s nature to smile, I swear, he would have. \"The servants of the Willow Land report joyfully that their queen has given birth to a daughter. All are healthy and well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body went perfect still, and for a moment, I saw nothing in the room except those glowing red eyes. Finally, I snapped back to myself. \"Thank you, Volusian.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does my mistress require me to learn anything else about this joyous occasion?\" There was a sneer in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Go back to Jasmine. Now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe obeyed, leaving me alone. I sat on the bed for several minutes, thinking of everything and nothing. I felt numb. I felt every emotion in the world. And when I suddenly ripped the air from the room and used it to smash a vase against the wall, I couldn\u0027t say if it was because of Dorian or Kiyo. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thorn-queen-dark-swan-2/page-15.html","bookId":2039,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:35:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:35:53 PM"}
