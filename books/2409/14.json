NAIL was run by a former CIA guy from Omaha, a paranoid electronics genius named Jay Ziegler, who built his own audio filter boards and playback equipment because, he said, he didn\u0027t trust anyone to do it for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNorton had constructed NAIL to help the government agencies interpret cockpit voice recorder tapes. After an accident, the government took CVRs and analyzed them in Washington. This was done to prevent them from being leaked to the press before an investigation was completed. But although the agencies had experienced staff to transcribe the tapes, they were less skilled at interpreting sounds inside the cockpit - the alarms and audio reminders that often went off. These sounds represented proprietary Norton systems, so Norton had built a facility to analyze them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heavy soundproof door, as always, was locked. Casey pounded on it, and after a while a voice on the speaker said, \"Give the password.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Casey Singleton, Jay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give the password.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jay, for Christ\u0027s sake. Open the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a click, and silence. She waited. The thick door pushed open a crack. She saw Jay Ziegler, hair down to his shoulders, wearing dark sunglasses. He said, \"Oh. All right. Come ahead, Singleton. You\u0027re cleared for this station.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the door a fraction wider, and she squeezed past him into a darkened room. Ziegler immediately slammed the door shut, threw three bolts in succession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better if you call first, Singleton. We have a secure line in. Four-level scramble encoded.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Jay, but something\u0027s come up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Security\u0027s everybody\u0027s business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe handed him the spool of magnetic tape. He glanced at it. \"This is one-inch mag, Singleton.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t often see this, at this station.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you read it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZiegler nodded. \"Can read anything, Singleton. Anything you throw at us.\" He put the tape on a horizontal drum and threaded it. Then he glanced over his shoulder. \"Are you cleared for the contents of this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my tape, Jay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just asking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"I should tell you that this tape is - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t tell me anything, Singleton. Better that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn all the monitors in the room, she saw oscilloscope squiggles, green lines jumping against black, as the tape began to play. \"Uh ... okay,\" Ziegler said. \"We got high-eight audio track, Dolby D encoded, got to be a home video camera ...\" Over the speaker, she heard a rhythmic crunching sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZiegler stared at his monitors. Some of them were now generating fancy data, building three-dimensional models of the sound, which looked like shimmering multicolored beads on a string. The programs were also generating slices at various hertz.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Footsteps,\" Ziegler announced \"Rubber-soled feet on grass or dirt. Countryside, no urban signature. Footsteps probably male. And, uh, slight dysrhythmic, he\u0027s probably carrying something. Not too heavy. But consistently off-balance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey remembered the first image on the videotape: a man walking up the path, away from a Chinese village, with the child on his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right,\" she said, impressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow there was a tweeting sound - some sort of birdcall. \"Hold on, hold on,\" Ziegler said, punching buttons. The tweet replayed, again and again, the beads jumping on the string. \"Huh,\" Ziegler said finally. \"Not in the database. Foreign locale?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"China.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh well. I can\u0027t do everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe footsteps continued. There was the sound of wind. On the tape, a male voice said, \"She\u0027s fallen asleep...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZiegler said, \"American, height five-nine to six-two, mid thirties.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, impressed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed a button, and one of the monitors showed the video image, the man walking up the path. The tape froze. \"Okay,\" Ziegler said. \"So what am I doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey said, \"The last nine minutes of tape were shot on Flight 545. This camera recorded the whole incident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really,\" Ziegler said, rubbing his hands together. \"That should be interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to know what you can tell me about unusual sounds in the moments just prior to the event. I have a question about - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t tell me,\" he said, holding up his hand. \"I don\u0027t want to know.

And Jay? I\u0027d appreciate if you\u0027d keep this tape to yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZiegler looked at her blankly. \"What tape?\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6:10 P.M.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey was back at her desk a little after 6 P.M.

Korman, PROD SUPPORT TO: C. Singleton, QA/IRT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have finalized the design parameters of the N-22 Virtual Heads-Up Display (VHUD) for use by ground personnel at domestic and foreign repair stations. The CD-ROM player now clips to the belt, and the goggles have been reduced in weight. The VHUD allows maintenance personnel to scroll Maintenance Manuals 12A/102-12 A/406, including diagrams and parts cutaways. Preliminary articles will be distributed for comments tomorrow. Production will begin 5/1.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis Virtual Heads-Up Display was part of Norton\u0027s ongoing effort to help the customers improve maintenance. Airframe manufacturers had long recognized that the majority of operational problems were caused by bad maintenance. In general, a properly maintained commercial aircraft would run for decades; some of the old Norton N-5s were sixty years old and still in service. On the other hand, an improperly maintained aircraft could get in trouble\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;or crash\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;within minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder financial pressure from deregulation, the airlines were cutting personnel, including maintenance personnel. And they were shortening the turnaround time between cycles; time on the ground had in some cases gone from two hours to less than twenty minutes. All this put intense pressure on maintenance crews. Norton, like Boeing and Douglas, saw it as in their interest to help crews work more effectively. That was why the Virtual Heads-Up Display, which projected the repair manuals on the inside of a set of glasses for maintenance people, was so important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext she saw the weekly summary of parts failures, compiled to enable the FAA to track parts problems more carefully. None of the failures in the previous week was serious. An engine compressor stalled; an engine EOT indicator failed; an oil filter clog light illuminated incorrectly; a fuel heat indicator went on erroneously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen there were more IRT follow-up reports from past incidents. Product Support checked all incident aircraft every two weeks for the next six months, to make sure that the assessment of the Incident Review Team had been accurate, and that the aircraft was not experiencing further trouble. Then they issued a summary report, like the one she now saw on her desk:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAIRCRAFT INCIDENT REPORT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePRIVILEGED INFORMATION\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eREPORT No:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; IRT-8-2776\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; TODAY\u0027S DATE:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; 08 April\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMODEL:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; N-20\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; INCIDENT DATE: 04 March\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOPERATOR:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Jet Atlantic\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; FUSELAGE No:\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; 1280\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNFA REPORTED BY: J.

She turned it off, and looked over at the tanned shoulder of the man next to her, and felt a burst of annoyance. He was a stuntman on a TV series, she\u0027d met him a few months back. He had a craggy face and a nice muscular body and he knew how to perform ... but Jeez, she hated it when guys stayed over. She had hinted politely, after the second time. But he\u0027d just rolled over and gone to sleep. And now here he was, snoring away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer hated to wake up with some guy in the room. She hated everything about it, the sounds they made breathing, the smell coming off their skin, their greasy hair on the pillow. Even the catches, the celebrities who made her heart skip over candlelight, looked like soggy beached whales the next day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like the guys didn\u0027t know their place. They came over; they got what they wanted; she got what she wanted; everyone was happy. So why didn\u0027t they go the fuck home?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d called him from the plane: Hi, I\u0027m coming into town, what are you doing tonight? And he said, without hesitation, Doing you. Which was fine with her. It was sort of funny, sitting in an airplane seat next to some accountant bent over his laptop, the voice in her ear saying, I\u0027m doing you tonight, in every room of your suite. Which, to his credit, he did. Not subtle, this guy, but he had lots of energy, that pure California body energy that you never found in New York. No reason to talk about anything. Just fuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now, sunlight streaming through the windows ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe got up from the bed, feeling the cold air-conditioned air on her naked skin, and went to the closet to choose the clothes she would wear. She was doing pretty straight types, so she picked jeans, a white Agnes B. T-shirt, and a navy Jil Sander jacket. She carried them into the bathroom, ran a shower. While the water was getting warm, she called the cameraman and told him to have the crew ready in the lobby in an hour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile she took her shower, she reviewed the coming day. Barker first at nine, she\u0027d film him briefly with some aviation background to warm him up, then break to do the rest at his office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext the reporter, Rogers. No time to do him at his newsroom in Orange County; she\u0027d start him at Burbank, another airport, different look. He\u0027d talk about Norton with the Norton buildings behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen at noon, she\u0027d talk to the Norton guy. By then she\u0027d already know the arguments from the other two guys, and she\u0027d try to scare Norton enough that they\u0027d give her access to the president\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then . . . let\u0027s see. The ambulance chaser later in the day, briefly. Someone from the FAA on Friday, for balance. Someone from Norton on Friday, as well. Marty would do a stand-up outside Norton, the script wasn\u0027t prepared but all she needed was the intro and the rest was voice-over. B-roll of passengers boarding, going to their doom. Takeoffs and landings, then some good crash shots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she was done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis segment was going to work, she thought, as she stepped out of the shower.
