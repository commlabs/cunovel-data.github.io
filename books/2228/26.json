No sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Secret Archives were black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear, Langdon now realized, was an intense motivator. Short of breath, he fumbled through the blackness toward the revolving door. He found the button on the wall and rammed his palm against it. Nothing happened. He tried again. The door was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpinning blind, he called out, but his voice emerged strangled. The peril of his predicament suddenly closed in around him. His lungs strained for oxygen as the adrenaline doubled his heart rate. He felt like someone had just punched him in the gut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he threw his weight into the door, for an instant he thought he felt the door start to turn. He pushed again, seeing stars. Now he realized it was the entire room turning, not the door. Staggering away, Langdon tripped over the base of a rolling ladder and fell hard. He tore his knee against the edge of a book stack. Swearing, he got up and groped for the ladder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found it. He had hoped it would be heavy wood or iron, but it was aluminum. He grabbed the ladder and held it like a battering ram. Then he ran through the dark at the glass wall. It was closer than he thought. The ladder hit head-on, bouncing off. From the feeble sound of the collision, Langdon knew he was going to need a hell of a lot more than an aluminum ladder to break this glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he flashed on the semiautomatic, his hopes surged and then instantly fell. The weapon was gone. Olivetti had relieved him of it in the Pope\u0027s office, saying he did not want loaded weapons around with the camerlegno present. It made sense at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon called out again, making less sound than the last time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext he remembered the walkie-talkie the guard had left on the table outside the vault. Why the hell didn\u0027t I bring it in! As the purple stars began to dance before his eyes, Langdon forced himself to think. You\u0027ve been trapped before, he told himself. You survived worse. You were just a kid and you figured it out. The crushing darkness came flooding in. Think!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon lowered himself onto the floor. He rolled over on his back and laid his hands at his sides. The first step was to gain control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelax. Conserve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo longer fighting gravity to pump blood, Langdon\u0027s heart began to slow. It was a trick swimmers used to re-oxygenate their blood between tightly scheduled races.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is plenty of air in here, he told himself. Plenty. Now think. He waited, half-expecting the lights to come back on at any moment. They did not. As he lay there, able to breathe better now, an eerie resignation came across him. He felt peaceful. He fought it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou will move, damn it! But where...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn Langdon\u0027s wrist, Mickey Mouse glowed happily as if enjoying the dark: 9:33 P.M. Half an hour until Fire. Langdon thought it felt a whole hell of a lot later. His mind, instead of coming up with a plan for escape, was suddenly demanding an explanation. Who turned off the power? Was Rocher expanding his search? Wouldn\u0027t Olivetti have warned Rocher that I\u0027m in here! Langdon knew at this point it made no difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOpening his mouth wide and tipping back his head, Langdon pulled the deepest breaths he could manage. Each breath burned a little less than the last. His head cleared. He reeled his thoughts in and forced the gears into motion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlass walls, he told himself. But damn thick glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wondered if any of the books in here were stored in heavy, steel, fireproof file cabinets. Langdon had seen them from time to time in other archives but had seen none here. Besides, finding one in the dark could prove time-consuming. Not that he could lift one anyway, particularly in his present state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow about the examination table? Langdon knew this vault, like the other, had an examination table in the center of the stacks. So what? He knew he couldn\u0027t lift it. Not to mention, even if he could drag it, he wouldn\u0027t get it far. The stacks were closely packed, the aisles between them far too narrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aisles are too narrow...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, Langdon knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a burst of confidence, he jumped to his feet far too fast. Swaying in the fog of a head rush, he reached out in the dark for support. His hand found a stack. Waiting a moment, he forced himself to conserve. He would need all of his strength to do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePositioning himself against the book stack like a football player against a training sled, he planted his feet and pushed. If I can somehow tip the shelf. But it barely moved. He realigned and pushed again. His feet slipped backward on the floor. The stack creaked but did not move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe needed leverage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinding the glass wall again, he placed one hand on it to guide him as he raced in the dark toward the far end of the vault. The back wall loomed suddenly, and he collided with it, crushing his shoulder. Cursing, Langdon circled the shelf and grabbed the stack at about eye level. Then, propping one leg on the glass behind him and another on the lower shelves, he started to climb. Books fell around him, fluttering into the darkness. He didn\u0027t care. Instinct for survival had long since overridden archival decorum. He sensed his equilibrium was hampered by the total darkness and closed his eyes, coaxing his brain to ignore visual input. He moved faster now. The air felt leaner the higher he went. He scrambled toward the upper shelves, stepping on books, trying to gain purchase, heaving himself upward. Then, like a rock climber conquering a rock face, Langdon grasped the top shelf. Stretching his legs out behind him, he walked his feet up the glass wall until he was almost horizontal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow or never, Robert, a voice urged. Just like the leg press in the Harvard gym.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith dizzying exertion, he planted his feet against the wall behind him, braced his arms and chest against the stack, and pushed. Nothing happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFighting for air, he repositioned and tried again, extending his legs. Ever so slightly, the stack moved. He pushed again, and the stack rocked forward an inch or so and then back. Langdon took advantage of the motion, inhaling what felt like an oxygenless breath and heaving again. The shelf rocked farther.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a swing set, he told himself. Keep the rhythm. A little more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon rocked the shelf, extending his legs farther with each push. His quadriceps burned now, and he blocked the pain. The pendulum was in motion. Three more pushes, he urged himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt only took two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was an instant of weightless uncertainty. Then, with a thundering of books sliding off the shelves, Langdon and the shelf were falling forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalfway to the ground, the shelf hit the stack next to it. Langdon hung on, throwing his weight forward, urging the second shelf to topple. There was a moment of motionless panic, and then, creaking under the weight, the second stack began to tip. Langdon was falling again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike enormous dominoes, the stacks began to topple, one after another. Metal on metal, books tumbling everywhere. Langdon held on as his inclined stack bounced downward like a ratchet on a jack. He wondered how many stacks there were in all. How much would they weigh? The glass at the far end was thick...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon\u0027s stack had fallen almost to the horizontal when he heard what he was waiting for - a different kind of collision. Far off. At the end of the vault. The sharp smack of metal on glass. The vault around him shook, and Langdon knew the final stack, weighted down by the others, had hit the glass hard. The sound that followed was the most unwelcome sound Langdon had ever heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no crashing of glass, only the resounding thud as the wall accepted the weight of the stacks now propped against it. He lay wide-eyed on the pile of books. Somewhere in the distance there was a creaking. Langdon would have held his breath to listen, but he had none left to hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne second. Two...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, as he teetered on the brink of unconsciousness, Langdon heard a distant yielding... a ripple spidering outward through the glass. Suddenly, like a cannon, the glass exploded. The stack beneath Langdon collapsed to the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike welcome rain on a desert, shards of glass tinkled downward in the dark. With a great sucking hiss, the air gushed in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty seconds later, in the Vatican Grottoes, Vittoria was standing before a corpse when the electronic squawk of a walkie-talkie broke the silence. The voice blaring out sounded short of breath. \"This is Robert Langdon! Can anyone hear me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria looked up. Robert! She could not believe how much she suddenly wished he were there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guards exchanged puzzled looks. One took a radio off his belt. \"Mr. Langdon? You are on channel three. The commander is waiting to hear from you on channel one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know he\u0027s on channel one, damn it! I don\u0027t want to speak to him. I want the camerlegno. Now! Somebody find him for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the obscurity of the Secret Archives, Langdon stood amidst shattered glass and tried to catch his breath. He felt a warm liquid on his left hand and knew he was bleeding. The camerlegno\u0027s voice spoke at once, startling Langdon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Camerlegno Ventresca. What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon pressed the button, his heart still pounding. \"I think somebody just tried to kill me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence on the line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon tried to calm himself. \"I also know where the next killing is going to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice that came back was not the camerlegno\u0027s. It was Commander Olivetti\u0027s: \"Mr. Langdon. Do not speak another word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e87\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon\u0027s watch, now smeared with blood, read 9:41 P.M. as he ran across the Courtyard of the Belvedere and approached the fountain outside the Swiss Guard security center. His hand had stopped bleeding and now felt worse than it looked. As he arrived, it seemed everyone convened at once - Olivetti, Rocher, the camerlegno, Vittoria, and a handful of guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria hurried toward him immediately. \"Robert, you\u0027re hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Langdon could answer, Olivetti was before him. \"Mr. Langdon, I\u0027m relieved you\u0027re okay. I\u0027m sorry about the crossed signals in the archives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Crossed signals?\" Langdon demanded. \"You knew damn well - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was my fault,\" Rocher said, stepping forward, sounding contrite. \"I had no idea you were in the archives. Portions of our white zones are cross-wired with that building. We were extending our search. I\u0027m the one who killed power. If I had known...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Robert,\" Vittoria said, taking his wounded hand in hers and looking it over, \"the Pope was poisoned. The Illuminati killed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon heard the words, but they barely registered. He was saturated. All he could feel was the warmth of Vittoria\u0027s hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camerlegno pulled a silk handkerchief from his cassock and handed it to Langdon so he could clean himself. The man said nothing. His green eyes seemed filled with a new fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Robert,\" Vittoria pressed, \"you said you found where the next cardinal is going to be killed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon felt flighty. \"I do, it\u0027s at the - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Olivetti interrupted. \"Mr. Langdon, when I asked you not to speak another word on the walkie-talkie, it was for a reason.\" He turned to the handful of assembled Swiss Guards. \"Excuse us, gentlemen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldiers disappeared into the security center. No indignity. Only compliance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti turned back to the remaining group. \"As much as it pains me to say this, the murder of our Pope is an act that could only have been accomplished with help from within these walls. For the good of all, we can trust no one. Including our guards.\" He seemed to be suffering as he spoke the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRocher looked anxious. \"Inside collusion implies - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Olivetti said. \"The integrity of your search is compromised. And yet it is a gamble we must take. Keep looking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRocher looked like he was about to say something, thought better of it, and left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camerlegno inhaled deeply. He had not said a word yet, and Langdon sensed a new rigor in the man, as if a turning point had been reached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Commander?\" The camerlegno\u0027s tone was impermeable. \"I am going to break conclave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti pursed his lips, looking dour. \"I advise against it. We still have two hours and twenty minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A heartbeat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti\u0027s tone was now challenging \"What do you intend to do? Evacuate the cardinals single-handedly?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I intend to save this church with whatever power God has given me. How I proceed is no longer your concern.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti straightened. \"Whatever you intend to do...\" He paused. \"I do not have the authority to restrain you. Particularly in light of my apparent failure as head of security. I ask only that you wait. Wait twenty minutes... until after ten o\u0027clock. If Mr. Langdon\u0027s information is correct, I may still have a chance to catch this assassin. There is still a chance to preserve protocol and decorum.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Decorum?\" The camerlegno let out a choked laugh. \"We have long since passed propriety, commander. In case you hadn\u0027t noticed, this is war.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA guard emerged from the security center and called out to the camerlegno, \"Signore, I just got word we have detained the BBC reporter, Mr. Glick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camerlegno nodded. \"Have both he and his camerawoman meet me outside the Sistine Chapel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti\u0027s eyes widened. \"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty minutes, commander. That\u0027s all I\u0027m giving you.\" Then he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Olivetti\u0027s Alpha Romeo tore out of Vatican City, this time there was no line of unmarked cars following him. In the back seat, Vittoria bandaged Langdon\u0027s hand with a first-aid kit she\u0027d found in the glove box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti stared straight ahead. \"Okay, Mr. Langdon. Where are we going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e88\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven with its siren now affixed and blaring, Olivetti\u0027s Alpha Romeo seemed to go unnoticed as it rocketed across the bridge into the heart of old Rome. All the traffic was moving in the other direction, toward the Vatican, as if the Holy See had suddenly become the hottest entertainment in Rome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon sat in the backseat, the questions whipping through his mind. He wondered about the killer, if they would catch him this time, if he would tell them what they needed to know, if it was already too late. How long before the camerlegno told the crowd in St. Peter\u0027s Square they were in danger? The incident in the vault still nagged. A mistake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti never touched the brakes as he snaked the howling Alpha Romeo toward the Church of Santa Maria della Vittoria. Langdon knew on any other day his knuckles would have been white. At the moment, however, he felt anesthetized. Only the throbbing in his hand reminded him where he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverhead, the siren wailed. Nothing like telling him we\u0027re coming, Langdon thought. And yet they were making incredible time. He guessed Olivetti would kill the siren as they drew nearer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow with a moment to sit and reflect, Langdon felt a tinge of amazement as the news of the Pope\u0027s murder finally registered in his mind. The thought was inconceivable, and yet somehow it seemed a perfectly logical event. Infiltration had always been the Illuminati powerbase - rearrangements of power from within. And it was not as if Popes had never been murdered. Countless rumors of treachery abounded, although with no autopsy, none was ever confirmed. Until recently. Academics not long ago had gotten permission to X-ray the tomb of Pope Celestine V, who had allegedly died at the hands of his overeager successor, Boniface VIII. The researchers had hoped the X-ray might reveal some small hint of foul play - a broken bone perhaps. Incredibly, the X-ray had revealed a ten-inch nail driven into the Pope\u0027s skull.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon now recalled a series of news clippings fellow Illuminati buffs had sent him years ago. At first he had thought the clippings were a prank, so he\u0027d gone to the Harvard microfiche collection to confirm the articles were authentic. Incredibly, they were. He now kept them on his bulletin board as examples of how even respectable news organizations sometimes got carried away with Illuminati paranoia. Suddenly, the media\u0027s suspicions seemed a lot less paranoid. Langdon could see the articles clearly in his mind...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe British Broadcasting Corporation\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJune 14, 1998\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePope John Paul I, who died in 1978, fell victim to a plot by the P2 Masonic Lodge... The secret society P2 decided to murder John Paul I when it saw he was determined to dismiss the American Archbishop Paul Marcinkus as President of the Vatican Bank. The Bank had been implicated in shady financial deals with the Masonic Lodge...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe New York Times\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAugust 24, 1998\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy was the late John Paul I wearing his day shirt in bed? Why was it torn? The questions don\u0027t stop there. No medical investigations were made. Cardinal Villot forbade an autopsy on the grounds that no Pope was ever given a postmortem. And John Paul\u0027s medicines mysteriously vanished from his bedside, as did his glasses, slippers and his last will and testament.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLondon Daily Mail\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAugust 27, 1998\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... a plot including a powerful, ruthless and illegal Masonic lodge with tentacles stretching into the Vatican.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cellular in Vittoria\u0027s pocket rang, thankfully erasing the memories from Langdon\u0027s mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria answered, looking confused as to who might be calling her. Even from a few feet away, Langdon recognized the laserlike voice on the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vittoria? This is Maximilian Kohler. Have you found the antimatter yet?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Max? You\u0027re okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw the news. There was no mention of CERN or the antimatter. This is good. What is happening?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We haven\u0027t located the canister yet. The situation is complex. Robert Langdon has been quite an asset. We have a lead on catching the man assassinating cardinals. Right now we are headed - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ms. Vetra,\" Olivetti interrupted. \"You\u0027ve said enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe covered the receiver, clearly annoyed. \"Commander, this is the president of CERN. Certainly he has a right to - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has a right,\" Olivetti snapped, \"to be here handling this situation. You\u0027re on an open cellular line. You\u0027ve said enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria took a deep breath. \"Max?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I may have some information for you,\" Max said. \"About your father... I may know who he told about the antimatter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria\u0027s expression clouded. \"Max, my father said he told no one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid, Vittoria, your father did tell someone. I need to check some security records. I will be in touch soon.\" The line went dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria looked waxen as she returned the phone to her pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You okay?\" Langdon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria nodded, her trembling fingers revealing the lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The church is on Piazza Barberini,\" Olivetti said, killing the siren and checking his watch. \"We have nine minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Langdon had first realized the location of the third marker, the position of the church had rung some distant bell for him. Piazza Barberini. Something about the name was familiar... something he could not place. Now Langdon realized what it was. The piazza was the sight of a controversial subway stop. Twenty years ago, construction of the subway terminal had created a stir among art historians who feared digging beneath Piazza Barberini might topple the multiton obelisk that stood in the center. City planners had removed the obelisk and replaced it with a small fountain called the Triton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Bernini\u0027s day, Langdon now realized, Piazza Barberini had contained an obelisk! Whatever doubts Langdon had felt that this was the location of the third marker now totally evaporated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA block from the piazza, Olivetti turned into an alley, gunned the car halfway down, and skidded to a stop. He pulled off his suit jacket, rolled up his sleeves, and loaded his weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t risk your being recognized,\" he said. \"You two were on television. I want you across the piazza, out of sight, watching the front entrance. I\u0027m going in the back.\" He produced a familiar pistol and handed it to Langdon. \"Just in case.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLangdon frowned. It was the second time today he had been handed the gun. He slid it into his breast pocket. As he did, he realized he was still carrying the folio from Diagramma. He couldn\u0027t believe he had forgotten to leave it behind. He pictured the Vatican Curator collapsing in spasms of outrage at the thought of this priceless artifact being packed around Rome like some tourist map. Then Langdon thought of the mess of shattered glass and strewn documents that he\u0027d left behind in the archives. The curator had other problems. If the archives even survive the night...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlivetti got out of the car and motioned back up the alley. \"The piazza is that way. Keep your eyes open and don\u0027t let yourselves be seen.\" He tapped the phone on his belt. \"Ms. Vetra, let\u0027s retest our auto dial.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVittoria removed her phone and hit the auto dial number she and Olivetti had programmed at the Pantheon. Olivetti\u0027s phone vibrated in silent-ring mode on his belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commander nodded. \"Good. If you see anything, I want to know.\" He cocked his weapon. \"I\u0027ll be inside waiting. This heathen is mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, very nearby, another cellular phone was ringing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hassassin answered. \"Speak.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is I,\" the voice said. \"Janus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hassassin smiled. \"Hello, master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your position may be known. Someone is coming to stop you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are too late. I have already made the arrangements here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Make sure you escape alive. There is work yet to be done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those who stand in my way will die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those who stand in your way are knowledgeable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You speak of an American scholar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are aware of him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hassassin chuckled. \"Cool-tempered but naive. He spoke to me on the phone earlier. He is with a female who seems quite the opposite.\" The killer felt a stirring of arousal as he recalled the fiery temperament of Leonardo Vetra\u0027s daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a momentary silence on the line, the first hesitation the Hassassin had ever sensed from his Illuminati master. Finally, Janus spoke. \"Eliminate them if need be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe killer smiled. \"Consider it done.\" He felt a warm anticipation spreading through his body. Although the woman I may keep as a prize. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/angels-demons-robert-langdon-1/page-26.html","bookId":2228,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:07:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:07:23 PM"}
