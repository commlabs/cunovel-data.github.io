What were their parents thinking to let them out of their sight? Hell, anyone could grab them. Anything could happen, and they wouldn’t know about it until it was too late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis attention returned to Laurant. “Lonnie had a flashlight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, it was more like a penlight, a red one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A red penlight . . . you mean, a laser beam, maybe?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, exactly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why didn’t you tell me this last night?” he demanded impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I told you Lonnie was on the roof.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The son of a bitch could have had you in his sights.” His face was tight with anger. “Where in God’s name would he get his hands on that kind of equipment?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“From his father’s cabinet,” she answered. “The sheriff prides himself on his gun collection, and Lonnie would have easy access.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick picked up his phone and started dialing. “And that’s why you came out of the bathroom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” she answered. “Who are you calling?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Farley,” he answered. “He can find out if Lonnie was on that roof or not.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who else could it have been?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick didn’t answer her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgent Farley was just about to step onto a plane in Des Moines when his phone rang. When he heard Nick’s voice, he moved away from the crowd filing on board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You just caught me,” he said. “Another minute and I would have turned my phone off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you pick up Lonnie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” he answered. “He’s gone to ground, and I’ve been reassigned. Wesson’s letting the Nugent sheriff and his deputies go after Lonnie and bring him in.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is Feinberg still around, or did Wesson send him packing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not sure,” Farley answered. “They both went to Nugent with Brenner,” he said. “And they could still be there. This isn’t sitting right with you, is it, Nick? You don’t think Brenner’s our man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I don’t,” he said. “But I don’t have anything to prove it yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This could be an easy case, and you’ve just never had one of those before.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, maybe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you going to stay in Holy Oaks?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry I had to bail on you, but I didn’t have a choice. As soon as Wesson E-mailed headquarters and let them know I was ready for reassignment, they pounced,”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are you headed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Detroit. There’s a situation brewing there, and it’s a messy one. Be thankful you’re on vacation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You be careful,” Nick said. “And Joe, thanks for helping.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A lot of damn good I did. I’ll tell you this. I’ve worked with Wesson a couple of times in the past, and he was always a pain in the ass, but he was never this difficult. I think it’s you,” he added. “You bring out the worst in him. He’s gone too far this time though. I’m never going to work with that egomaniac again, even if means handing in my badge. By the book, my ass. Wesson doesn’t know what teamwork is, and that’s what’s going in my report,” Joe paused a second. “Nick you know what’s worrying me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Getting on that plane?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, that’s your hang-up, not mine. It’s that gut feeling of yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you’re right, and Brenner isn’t the unsub, then you and Noah are out there all alone. God help you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 32\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurant found a couple of gowns that would work for the wedding, and after they dropped off the clothes at the cleaners, they drove to the abbey. Noah was in the kitchen eating cold fried chicken with all the trimmings. Nick pulled out a chair for Laurant as he grabbed a chicken leg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should eat something, honey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah’s right eyebrow shot up, and his gaze bounced between Laurant’s flushed face and Nick’s pained expression. Then he burst into laughter. “It took you long enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t start,” Nick warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t start what?” Noah asked innocently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nick calls everyone honey,” Laurant blurted, feeling like a fool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sure he does,” Noah agreed. “He’s been calling Tommy and me honey every chance he gets.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let it alone,” Nick insisted. “Where is Tommy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s in one of the conference rooms with that editor woman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What does she want?” Laurant asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah shrugged. “Beats me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick heard a door close behind him and crossed the kitchen to look out the window. He saw Lorna hurry down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where did this feast come from?” Laurant asked Noah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Noah’s fan club,” Tommy answered from the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah grinned. “The ladies like me. What can I say?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s been doing a little counseling.” Tommy shook his head in exasperation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, I’m good at it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurant was having trouble looking at her brother. It was Nick’s fault, she knew, because he had planted the ridiculous notion that Tommy would know what happened last night if he looked in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Laurant, I want a word in private with you,” Tommy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick gave her an I-told-you-he’d-know look and turned around. “Tommy, you and I have to talk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Laurant all but shouted as she pushed the chair back and stood. “What do you want to talk to me about?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lorna was just here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did she want?” Laurant asked. “She has enough news to keep her busy for the next month, what with the fire and Steve Brenner. Is she trying to figure out a way to blame me for all that too?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She is writing another article about you, but it doesn’t have anything to do with the fire or Brenner. She wanted confirmation from me. It seems she ran into the banker’s wife, who mentioned the money you borrowed for your store, and one bit of gossip led to another. Damn it, Laurant,” he said, his voice shaking with anger, “why didn’t you tell me the trust was gone? All this time, I thought you were fine and I wouldn’t have to worry about you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurant was stunned by Lorna’s audacity. “I had to fill out a financial statement, and I had to explain about the trust in order to get the loan,” she cried. “But the banker had no right to tell anyone, not even his wife. That was confidential information. And how dare Lorna poke her nose in my affairs.” She took a step toward her brother. “Did you hear what you just said to me? All this time you thought I was fine and you wouldn’t have to worry about me? I’m not ten years old, Tommy, but you can’t seem to get that through your head. The money was gone before I turned twenty-one and could do anything about it. The lawyers took it. Every cent. I didn’t tell you because I knew you’d get upset, and there wasn’t anything you could do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Millions of dollars . . . our grandfather’s hard-earned money gone? When I signed my trust over to them to put with yours, I thought . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brother’s expression made her want to cry. He looked devastated. And horribly disappointed in her. He made her feel as though she had squandered the money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It wasn’t your sister’s fault,” Nick said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not acting like you do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy’s shoulders slumped. “When exactly did you find out the money was gone?” His face was red with the anger he was trying to contain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On my twenty-first birthday.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should have told your family then. Maybe something could have been done.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah knew it wasn’t his place to interfere, but he couldn’t stop himself. He looked Tommy in the eye and said, “What family? From what I’ve gathered, Laurant didn’t have one of those when she was growing up. Who exactly was she supposed to tell?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m her family,” Tommy railed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Try to see it her way,” Noah insisted. “When you were growing up, you had Nick’s family to help you, and when you joined the priesthood, the church became your new family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My sister will always be part of my family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She was in Europe, and you were here. You can’t change the way things were. The guilt is making you angry because she was left out in the cold.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy looked tormented. Laurant slowly shook her head and went to him. “That isn’t true. I wasn’t out in the cold. I always knew you were there for me. I knew you were fighting to get me to the United States. Tommy, I always knew you loved me. Please don’t be angry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his arms around her and hugged her. “It just came as a shock, that’s all. Don’t keep things from me, Laurant. Big brothers are supposed to look out for their little sisters, no matter how old they are. Look, let’s make a pact, okay? From now on, we don’t hide anything from each other. If I have to have chemo, I tell you, and if you have a problem, you tell me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t expect you to solve my problems for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, I know you don’t, but you should be able to talk to me about them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded. “Yes, okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When’s the article going to run?” Nick asked. He was trying to figure out if there was time to stop it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It isn’t going to be in the paper. Lorna and I had a little talk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah grinned. “Did you threaten her with the fires of hell?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy wasn’t amused. “No, I didn’t, but I did talk to her about being jealous of Laurant. She didn’t want to hear my opinions, but she agreed not to run the article. She’s afraid other people will think she’s jealous because she’s gone after Laurant so many times.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need a glass of milk,” Laurant said. Her stomach was upset, thanks to Lorna, and she hoped the milk would settle it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll get it. You go sit down,” Tommy offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah pushed her plate in front of her. “Eat,” he suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isn’t there anything you can do about those lawyers?” Nick asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am doing something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy poked his head out of the pantry. “What?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m suing them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brother grabbed a glass and hurried back into the kitchen. “You’re suing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” she said. “The day after I found out, I started searching. It took a year to find an attorney who was willing to take on the giants.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“David against Goliath, huh?” Noah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know, Noah, you’re starting to think like a priest. Maybe you ought to consider joining up,” Nick teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah grimaced. “That isn’t going to happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy got the gallon of milk out of the refrigerator and poured some into Laurant’s glass. “But about the suit? What’s happening?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a drink before she answered. “I won the first round, and then I won again. They’ve been dragging it out with motions to delay, but my attorney told me that this next round is the last appeal. I should hear something soon. Win or lose, it will be final.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, there’s a good possibility you could get the money back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It could go either way,” she said. “I’m prepared for either outcome.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No wonder you drive that junky old car,” Nick said. “You’ve been living on a shoestring.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was smiling at her, as though he thought she had done something remarkable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I budget like most people do,” she said. “And I happen to like my car.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe conversation came to an abrupt end when the sheriff came storming into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where the hell is my boy?” he demanded in a snarl. He had his gun half drawn as he shouted, “What have you done with him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick’s back was to the door, but Noah sat facing the stampeding sheriff. In a heartbeat, his hand reached inside his black robe and pointed the gun under the table at Lloyd. “You pull that weapon out, and you’re a dead man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLloyd stopped, frozen in his tracks. He was stunned by this priest who dared to threaten him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaurant hadn’t even had time to turn in her chair before Nick had whirled around and drawn his weapon. He was standing now, shielding her, and the barrel of his gun was pressed against Lloyd’s temple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy came up behind the sheriff and took the gun away from him. Then he calmly suggested that Lloyd sit down and discuss the problem in a reasonable manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m the authority here,” he bellowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, you’re not,” Nick informed him. He put his gun back in the holster and told the sheriff to do as Tommy had said and sit down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLloyd chose the chair at the far end of the table. “Give me my gun back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTommy handed Nick the weapon, and he quickly unloaded the magazine before he slid the gun toward the sheriff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What seems to be the problem?” Tommy asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My boy,” Lloyd muttered. “He’s gone missing. That’s what the problem is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s hiding,” Nick told him. “He started that fire, and now he’s hiding.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLloyd shook his head. “I ain’t gonna get into all that fire business ’cause you and I see it different from each other. My boy knows he’s got me for his alibi. He wouldn’t think he had to hide. He was in bed, sleeping sound, when I got home from Nugent. I was dead tired,” he added. “Up most of the night, and I was just getting myself in bed when the low-life sheriff from Nugent knocked on my door. He said he was gonna take Lonnie and book him on arson. We argued a bit, but then I decided to let the lawyers handle it, and I let him on in. Lonnie weren’t in his bed though, and his window was wide open.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick glanced at Noah, who promptly shook his head to let him know he hadn’t done anything with Lonnie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNick said then, “Maybe Wesson decided to pick him up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That ain’t what happened.” The sheriff was whining now. “He’s still with the others cooped up with Brenner in a two-by-four room, questioning him. They wouldn’t let me listen in, didn’t want me to know nothing that was going on. I finally gave up and was heading out the door when I heard they were accusing him of murder. One of the sheriff ’s deputies told me they had the goods on him.” He took his hat off and rubbed his brow. “It’s all going in the toilet.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/heartbreaker-buchanan-renard-1/page-43.html","bookId":1835,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:38:23 PM"}
