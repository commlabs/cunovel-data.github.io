I deserved to be admired on the court, because I was worth something when I played. Not only was I part of the team, I was the one my teammates looked up to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more that other dads showed up to matches, the harder I would play. It was as if I wanted those dads to regret I wasn\u0027t their kid. No matter if my dad loved me or not, there would be other dads that would do anything to have me be their daughter. Having other dads congratulate me was worth more to me than the varsity trophy I earned my sophomore year. I might not be worthy of my dad\u0027s love, but I was worthy of that trophy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pain in my leg shoots up into my spine, a mocking reminder that I\u0027ll never be a champion again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maggie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn toward my mom, who\u0027s now officially freaked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t play tennis,\" I tell her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Gerrard wants you to try. You will try, won\u0027t you?\" But I won\u0027t be good, and then my dad wont have anything to be proud of me for. He\u0027ll never want me to be part of his new family. \"Can we go home? I want to go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom sighs. I hate feeling like I\u0027m disappointing her. I know she tries so hard to support us emotionally, physically, and financially. She\u0027s like the little cheerleader of our family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we get in the car, I calm down. I look at my mom, driving the car with a sad look on her face. \"Mom, what do you want out of life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gives a little laugh. \"Right now, money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Besides money.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cocks her head to the side, thinking. When we reach a red light, she turns to me. \"I guess I\u0027d like a partner to share my life with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you miss Dad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes. I miss the companionship, I miss going out as a couple. I don\u0027t miss the fights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light turns green and we accelerate, our car passing a woman and man holding hands with their daughter. \"Will he ever want me to visit him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One day,\" she says, but I can tell she\u0027s not so sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to date Mr. Reynolds?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes go wide. \"Why would you ask such a thing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you were dancing with him at the Fall Festival. He doesn\u0027t have kids. I think he came to be with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMom laughs, this big laugh that fills the car, and the people in the next car could probably hear her, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Auntie Mae\u0027s Diner was a sponsor of the event, Maggie. That\u0027s why Lou was there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" I say defensively, \"you two were looking pretty chummy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was just being nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hmm ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing. Just go back to being a kid, will ya?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sit in silence the rest of the way home. When we walk inside the house, I ignore the lump in my throat as I say, \"For the record ... if you want to invite Mr. Reynolds over for dinner one night, I wouldn\u0027t mind,\" and head upstairs to my room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my room, I want to take my words back. I only said them because I know how miserable Mom has been lately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the truth is I miss my dad every day, too. More than anything. And I know he has another wife and another life. What if Mom and Mr. Reynolds start dating or, even worse, get married. Will they want to start a new life without me, too?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lock my door and open my closet. In the back, in the darkest shadows, is my racquet. I know it\u0027s there although it\u0027s hidden behind clothes. I feel its presence when I\u0027m in my room, kind of like kryptonite for Superman. Desperation washes over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach out and grab the handle, the weight of the racquet foreign but, at the same time, familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maggie, open the door.\" Panic. \"Just a second.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI toss the racquet in the closet and unlock my door. Mom is staring at me strangely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI brush the hair from my face, hoping she can\u0027t see right through me and realize I\u0027ve always known where my lost racquet is. \"Mom, what\u0027s up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was thinking. About Lou, my boss. Were you serious when you said I should invite him for dinner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWENTY-SEVEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaleb\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked Brian to meet me at the park for some one-on-one. I\u0027m practicing free throws when he drives up in his Yukon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look like a middle-aged man in that thing,\" I say. He gives a fake-insulted huff. \"It\u0027s better than the car you drive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t drive one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stand facing each other. I say what needs to be said. \"Listen, about you and Kendra. How about we call a truce.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fair enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pass him the ball. He dribbles the ball too far away from his body, so I knock it and grab it away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"B-ball\u0027s still not your game, is it?\" I say as I dribble down the court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrian\u0027s shuffling backwards, following my every move. When I stop, his hands are up and ready to block my shot. \"Get me on a wrestling mat and I\u0027ll kick your ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a shot. It bounces off the rim and Brian gets the rebound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrian is an anxious player. He runs down the court and shoots too quickly, missing the basket by a mile. The ball lands in the grass. I take the ball inbounds. \"You\u0027re a lightweight, Bri,\" I say. \"I\u0027d pin you in less than ten seconds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put your money where your mouth is, big guy, tomorrow after school.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI move around Brian and make an easy lay-up. \"I have to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe holds the ball. \"You say that, but you never say where. Rumor has it you\u0027re a homo and meet up with your lover after school. Is he the one who gave you the bruise on your face?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy muscles start to tense up. \"Don\u0027t give me shit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrian starts dribbling down the court, his eye on the basket. \"Why? You gonna threaten me like you threatened Drew?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrian shoots and the ball goes right in. This time I hold the ball under my arm, stopping the game. \"He was trying to piss me off and you know it.\" My old friend crosses his arms on his chest. \"You\u0027ve changed, Caleb. I don\u0027t even know you anymore. And this has nothing to do with Kendra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bullshit. I\u0027m the same person.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs. \"You\u0027ve got a chip on your shoulder. Everybody knows it but you. That\u0027s the scary part.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, the scary part is that people don\u0027t realize how much they\u0027ve changed. \"So everyone else is the same except me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, dude. Everybody\u0027s changed, nobody is the same. You\u0027re the only one who can\u0027t accept it. You\u0027re not a sophomore anymore, you\u0027re not dating Kendra, you\u0027re not the wrestling stud. You\u0027re a bad-ass, brooding ex-con.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll show him a brooding ex-con. I dribble the ball down the court, and when Brian gets in my face I push him down before I take the shot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Foul!\" Brian calls out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said to accept my bad-ass ex-con self. I\u0027m only taking your suggestion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold out a hand. He looks at me suspiciously, then grabs my wrist as I pull him up. I get three more baskets and recover two of Brian\u0027s rebounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what you need?\" Brian says as he wipes sweat from his brow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A new best friend?\" I suggest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. You need a girlfriend. Name a chick you think is hot. Just throw out a name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maggie Armstrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, seriously. Name a chick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dude, that\u0027s sick. You went to jail because of her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m well aware of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re telling me you have the hots for the Maggie Armstrong? Your next-door neighbor? The girl who walks weird because you ran over her leg with your car?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brian, you\u0027re starting to act like Drew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrian looks confused as he\u0027s trying to comprehend what I just admitted to him. Then he bursts out laughing. He can\u0027t stop and falls to the ground in hysterics, holding his stomach. \"That\u0027s ... hilarious!\" he yells when he can catch his breath. \"Oh my God, it can\u0027t be true ...\" he says, then goes back to laughing hysterically again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m seriously considering kicking his ass right now. But this isn\u0027t Vic or Drew, this is Brian. I take the ball and head back home, but not before telling Brian to go to hell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody is home; I have the house all to myself. I want to yell at the top of my lungs, but just as I\u0027m about to do it the doorbell rings. Brian is an idiot if he\u0027s stupid enough to come here to laugh in my face again. Maybe, after all, I will use his head as my punching bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I open the door and my ex-best friend isn\u0027t standing in front of me. It\u0027s Kendra, my ex-girlfriend. Shiny lips and all. \"Hi,\" she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are your parents home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope.\" She already knew they weren\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I come in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI open the door wider. She heads straight upstairs to my room. I watch her back and my eyes focus on her thong underwear sticking out of the top of her shorts before I follow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing my door like I always do when we\u0027re about to fool around, I lean back against the door and watch her. But this time we\u0027re not going to fool around. I know it. She doesn\u0027t, obviously, I can tell by what she\u0027s wearing. A ridiculously low-cut shirt, I swear her nipples are millimeters below the ruffled collar. And her shorts reveal way more than I\u0027d ever want any girlfriend of mine to reveal. But she\u0027s not my girlfriend, she\u0027s Brian\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKendra wanders around my bedroom, fingering my desk, my dresser, and my bookshelves. When she picks up my lightsaber and turns it on, I\u0027m tempted to tell her not to touch it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When are you going to get rid of these toys?\" she asks, waving it in the air. I don\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing, she says, \"I know Brian told you about him and me. But I still love you, you know.\" She closes the distance between us, close enough that I can smell her cherry lips. She licks them and leans in for a kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn my head away. \"What? One boyfriend isn\u0027t enough for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s over, Kend. Way over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not and you know it. Because--and I know this sounds selfish, but it\u0027s true--I don\u0027t want anyone else to have you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Break up with Brian. The guy wants to marry you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe chuckles. \"My parents think he\u0027s good for me, so I\u0027m playing along. Besides, I need a boyfriend I can hang with in public. But you can be my private boyfriend, CB.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never gonna happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wanna bet?\" She steps back, points the tip of the saber at me, and pushes the blunt tip against my throat. A wicked grin crosses her mouth. \"You can be my little secret. You like keeping secrets, don\u0027t you Caleb?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy pulse quickens, and the mood in the room changes instantly. One thought burns in my brain ... she knows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\" I say evenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"CB, don\u0027t look so sad. I just want you,\" she says, then lowers the saber and goes in for another kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time I don\u0027t turn away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTWENTY-EIGHT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a week for Mom to invite Mr. Reynolds over for dinner. She asked me about twenty more times if it was okay with me. I didn\u0027t have the heart to say no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Reynolds comes in the house wearing a grey three-piece suit and red tie, as if he\u0027s going to court for a traffic violation. In his hands are a dozen purple tulips for my mom and a box of Frango chocolates for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I say awkwardly as he hands me the box. Do I open it now, or wait until later ... or tomorrow? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/leaving-paradise-leaving-paradise-1/page-19.html","bookId":2771,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:16:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:16:18 PM"}
