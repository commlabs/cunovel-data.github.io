Maybe because we publish a respectable paper.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did the man who called know about the Mogadorians?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He said he had captured one of them and tortured it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. His phone number was from the area code near Columbus. So north of here. Maybe sixty or eighty miles north.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You spoke to him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. And I wasn’t sure if he was crazy or not, but we had heard rumors about something like this before. He started talking about them wanting to wipe out civilization as we know it, and sometimes he talked so fast that it was hard to make sense of anything he said. One thing he kept repeating was that they were here hunting something, or somebody. Then he started spouting numbers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes open wide. “What numbers? What did they mean?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have no idea. Like I said, he was talking so fast that it was all we could do to write it all down.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You wrote while he talked?” Henri says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course we did. We’re journalists,” he says incredulously. “Do you think we make up the stories we write?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, I do,” says Henri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you still have the notes that you wrote?” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks at me and nods. “I’m telling you, they’re worthless. Most of what I wrote are scribbles on their plan to destroy the human race.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I need to see them,” I nearly bellow. “Where, where are they?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe motions towards a desk against one of the walls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“On the desk. On sticky notes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk over to the desk, which is covered with papers, and start looking through the sticky notes. I find some very vague notes on the Mogadorians’ hope to conquer Earth. Nothing concrete, no plans or details, just a few indistinct words:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Overpopulation”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Earth’s resources”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Biological warfare?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Planet Mogadore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI come to the note I’m looking for. I read it carefully three or four times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlanet Lorien? The Loric?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1–3 dead\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7 trailed in Spain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9 on the run in SA\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(what is he talking about? What do these numbers have to do with invading Earth?)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why is there a question mark after the number 4?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because he said something about it but he talked too fast and I didn’t get it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve got to be kidding me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head. I sigh. Just my luck, I think. The one thing said about me is the one thing that wasn’t written.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What does ‘SA’ mean?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“South America.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did he say where in South America?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, stare at the slip of paper. I wish I could have heard the conversation, that I could have asked questions of my own. Do the Mogadorians really know where Seven is? Are they really following him or her? If so, the Loric charm still holds. I fold the sticky notes and slip them into my back pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you know what the numbers mean?” he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. “I have no idea.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t believe you,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shut up,” Sam says, and pokes him in the gut with the heavy end of the bat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is there anything else you can tell me?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thinks about it for a moment, then says, “I think bright light bothers them. It seemed to cause them pain when they took their sunglasses off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hear a noise downstairs. Like someone trying to slowly open the door. We look at each other. I look to the man in the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who is that?” I quietly say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They said they’d be watching. That they knew someone might be coming.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hear quiet footsteps on the first floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenri and Sam look at each other, both terrified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why didn’t you tell us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They said they’d kill me. And my family.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI run to the window, look out the back. We’re on the second floor. It’s a twenty-foot drop to the ground. There’s a fence around the yard. Eight feet of wood slats. I move quickly back to the stairs, and peer down. I see three huge figures, in long black trench coats, black hats, and sunglasses. They’re carrying long gleaming swords. There’s no way we’re going to make it down the stairs. My Legacies are growing stronger, but they aren’t strong enough to take on three Mogadorians. The only way out is through one of the windows or over a small porch at the front of the room. The windows are smaller but the backyard will allow us to escape unseen. If we go out the front, we will most likely be visible. I hear noise coming from the basement and the Mogadorians talking to each other in an ugly, guttural language. Two of them move towards the basement while the third starts walking towards the stairs that lead to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have a second or two to act. The windows will break if we go through them. Our only chance is the doors leading to the second-floor porch. I open them using telekinesis. It’s black outside. I hear footsteps coming up the stairs. I pull Sam and Henri over to me and I throw each of them over my shoulders like sacks of potatoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing?” whispers Henri.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have no idea,” I say. “But I hope it works.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as I see the top of the first Mogadorian’s hat, I sprint towards the doors and right before the ledge of the porch, I jump. We go flying into the night sky. For two or three seconds we’re floating. I see cars moving down the street beneath us. I see people on the sidewalk. I don’t know where we’re going to land, or if my body will support all the weight I’m carrying when we do. When we hit the roof of a house across the street I collapse, with Sam and Henri on top of me. I get my breath knocked out of me, and it feels like my legs are broken. Sam starts to stand, but Henri keeps him down. He drags me to the far end of the roof and asks if I can use my telekinesis to get him and Sam onto the ground. I can and I do. He tells me I need to jump. I stand on legs that are wobbly and still hurt, and just before I jump, I turn and see the three Mogadorians are standing on the porch across the street, looking confused. Their swords are gleaming. Without a second to spare, we got away without them seeing us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe get to Sam’s truck. Henri and Sam have to help me walk. Bernie is there waiting for us. We decide to leave Henri’s truck because they most likely know what it looks like and would track it. We pull out of Athens and Henri starts driving back to Paradise, which it really might be after the night we just had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenri starts from the beginning, telling Sam everything. He doesn’t stop until we are pulling into our driveway. It’s still dark. Sam looks over at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Unbelievable,” he says, and smiles. “It’s the coolest thing I’ve ever heard of.” I look at him and I see the validation he has always looked for in his life, an affirmation that the time he’s spent with his nose in the conspiracy rags, looking for clues to his father’s disappearance, wasn’t in vain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you really resistant to fire?” he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God, that’s awesome.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks, Sam.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can you fly?” he asks. At first I think he is joking, but then I see that he isn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t fly. I’m resistant to fire and can turn my hands into lights. I have telekinesis, which I only learned to use yesterday. More Legacies are supposed to come soon. We think so, anyhow. But I have no idea what they will be until they actually develop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hope you learn to make yourself invisible,” Sam says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My grandfather could. And anything he touched also became invisible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seriously?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe starts laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I still can’t believe you two drove all the way to Athens by yourselves,” Henri says. “You guys are really something. When we stopped for gas I saw that the plates have been expired for four years. I really don’t see how you made it without getting stopped.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, you can count on me from now on,” says Sam. “I’ll do whatever it takes to help stop them. Especially because I bet they’re the ones who took my dad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks, Sam,” says Henri. “The most important thing you could do is stay quiet with our secret. If anyone else finds out about this it could lead to our deaths.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry. I’ll never tell anyone. I don’t want John using his powers on me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe laugh and thank Sam again and he pulls away. Henri and I go inside. Even though I slept on the drive back, I’m still exhausted. I lie down on the couch. Henri sits in a chair across from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sam won’t say anything,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn’t respond, just stares at the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They don’t know we’re here,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They don’t,” I say. “If they knew they’d be following us now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stays silent. I can’t take it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not leaving Ohio on nothing more than speculation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenri stands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m happy that you’ve made a friend. And I think Sarah is great. But we can’t stay. I’m going to start packing,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When we’re packed I’ll go into town and buy a new truck. We need to get out of here. They might not have followed us, but they know how close they were at catching us, and that we might still be nearby. I believe the man who called the magazine did in fact capture one of them. That was his story, that he captured one and tortured it until it talked and then he killed it. We don’t know what kind of tracking technology they have, but I don’t think it will take them long to find us. And when they do, we’ll die. Your Legacies are emerging, and your strength is growing, but you’re nowhere near ready to fight them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walks out of the room. I sit up. I don’t want to leave. I have a real friend for the first time in my life. A friend who knows what I am and isn’t scared, doesn’t think I’m a freak. A friend who is willing to fight with me, and go into danger with me. And I have a girlfriend. Someone who wants to be with me, even without knowing who I am. Someone who makes me happy, someone I would fight for, or go into danger in order to protect. My Legacies haven’t all emerged yet, but enough of them have. I took down three grown men. They didn’t stand a chance. It was like fighting with little kids. I could do anything I wanted to them. We also now know that humans can also fight, and capture, and hurt, and kill Mogadorians. If they can, then I definitely can. I don’t want to leave. I have a friend, and I have a girlfriend. I am not going to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenri walks back out of his room. He is carrying the Loric Chest that is our most prized possession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Henri,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re not leaving.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes we are.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/i-am-number-four-lorien-legacies-1/page-27.html","bookId":1675,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:18 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:49:18 AM"}
