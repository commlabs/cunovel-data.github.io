My home in Beverly Hills, where we drive after leaving Las Vegas, is one of the most opulent ones. As we enter the front door, Seymour stares in wonder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we stay here,\" he says, \"I have to get new clothes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can have the clothes, but we\u0027re not staying. Ray\u0027s father knew about this house, so the govern?ment might as well. We\u0027re just here to get money, credit cards, clothes, and fresh identification.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeymour is doubtful. \"The government knew you were at the compound. They\u0027ll think you died in the blast.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll have to know for sure that I died. They were obsessed with my blood, so they\u0027ll research every possible lead concerning me.\" I step to the window and peer outside. It is the middle of the night. \"They may be watching us now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeymour shrugs. \"Are you going to get me fresh ID?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance at him. \"You should go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head firmly. \"I\u0027m not going to leave you. Forget it. I mean, you don\u0027t even know how to be human.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step past him. \"We can discuss this later. We don\u0027t want to be here a minute more than we have to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the basement of my Beverly Hills home, I pick up the things I mentioned to Seymour. I also take a 9mm Smith \u0026amp; Wesson equipped with a silencer and several rounds of ammunition. My reflexes and vision are not what they used to be, but I believe I am still an excellent shot. All my supplies I load into a large black leather suitcase. I am surprised how much it weighs as I carry it back upstairs. My physical weak?ness is disconcerting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t let Seymour see the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe leave Beverly Hills and drive toward Santa Monica. I let Seymour drive; the speed of the sur?rounding cars disturbs me. It is as if I am a young woman from 3000 B.C. who has been plucked from her slow-paced world and dumped into the dizzyingly fast twentieth century. I tell myself I just need time to get used to it. My euphoria over being human remains, but the anxiety is there as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho was at the door?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t imagine. Not even a single possibility comes to mind. But there was something about that voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe check into a Sheraton hotel by the beach. My new name is Candice Hall. Seymour is just a friend helping me with my bags. I don\u0027t put his name down on the register. I will not stay Candice long. I have other ID that I can change my hair style and color to match, as well as other small features. Yet I feel safe as I close the door of the hotel room behind me. Since Las Vegas, I have kept an eye on the rearview mirror. I don\u0027t believe we\u0027ve been followed. Seymour sets my bag on the floor as I plop down on the bed and sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t felt this exhausted in a long time,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeymour sits beside me. \"We humans are always tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am going to enjoy being human. I don\u0027t care what you say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stares at me in the dimly lit room. \"Sita?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close my eyes and yawn. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am sorry what I said. If this makes you happy, then it makes me happy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just worry, you know, that there\u0027s no going back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit up and touch his leg. \"The decision would have been meaningless if I could have gone back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe understands my subtle meaning. \"You didn\u0027t do this because of what Krishna said to you about vampires?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod. \"I think partly. I don\u0027t think Krishna approved of vampires. I think he just allowed me to live out of his deep compassion for all living things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe there was another reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps.\" I touch his face. \"Did I ever tell you how dear you are to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiles. \"No. You were always too busy threaten?ing to kill me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel a stab of pain. It is in my chest, where a short time ago a stake pierced my heart. For a moment the area is raw with an agonizing burning, as if I am bleeding to death. But it is a brief spasm. I draw in a shuddering breath and speak in a sad voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I always kill the ones I love.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes my hand. \"That was before. It can be different now that you\u0027re not a monster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to laugh, although it is still not easy to take a deep breath. \"Is that a line you use to get a girl to go to bed with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leans closer. \"I already have you in bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI roll onto my side. \"I need to take a shower. We both need to rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe draws back, disappointed. \"You haven\u0027t changed that much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand and fluff up his hair, trying to cheer him up. \"But I have. I\u0027m a nineteen-year-old girl again. You just forget what monsters teenage girls can be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe is suddenly moved. \"I never knew the exact age you were when Yaksha changed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pause and think of Rama, my long dead husband, and Lalita, my daughter, cremated fifty centuries ago in a place I was never to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I say softly. \"I was almost twenty when Yaksha came for me.\" And because I was suspended so long between the ages, I add again, \"Almost.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later Seymour is fast asleep beside me on the king-size bed. But despite my physical exhaustion, my mind refuses to shut down. I can\u0027t be free of the images of Joel\u0027s and Arturo\u0027s faces from two nights earlier when I suddenly began to turn to light, to dissolve, to leave them just before the bomb was detonated. At the time I knew I was dead. It was a certainty. Yet one last miracle occurred and I lived on. Perhaps there was a reason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI climb out of bed and dress. Before leaving the hotel room, I load my pistol and tuck it in my belt, at the back, pulling my sweatshirt over it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hotel is located on Ocean Ave. I cross over it, and the Coast Highway that separates me from the ocean. Soon I am walking along the dark and foggy Santa Monica Beach, not the safest place to be in the early morning hours before the sun rises. Yet I walk briskly, heading south, paying little attention to my surroundings. What work it is to make my legs move over the sand! It is as if I walk with weights strapped around my ankles. Sweat drips in my eyes and I pant audibly. But I feel good as well. Finally, after thirty minutes of toil, my mind begins to relax, and I contemplate returning to the hotel and trying to sleep. It is only then that I become aware that two men are following me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey are fifty yards behind me. In the dark it is hard to distinguish their features, but it is clear they are both Caucasian and well built, maybe thirty years old. They move like two good ol\u0027 boys, one dark featured, ugly, the other bright as a bottle of beer foaming in the sunlight. I think these boys have been drinking beer--and stronger--and are feeling un?comfortably horny. I smile to myself as I anticipate the encounter, even imagine what their blood will taste like. Then I remember I am not who I used to be. A wave of fear sweeps through my body, but I stand and wait for them to come to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, girl,\" the one with dark hair says with a Southern accent. \"What are you doing out at this time of night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug. \"Just out for a walk. What are you guys up to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blond guy snickers. \"How old are you, girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dark-haired one moves slightly to my left. He flexes his fists as he speaks. \"We just want to know if you\u0027re legal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m old enough to vote,\" I say. \"Not old enough to drink. You boys been drinking tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both chuckle. The blond guy moves a step closer. He smells of beer, whiskey. \"You might say we\u0027ve been looking at the wrong end of a few bottles tonight. But don\u0027t let that worry you none. We\u0027re still fully capable of finishing what we start.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a step back. Perhaps it\u0027s a mistake that I show fear. \"I don\u0027t want any trouble,\" I say. And I mean it, although I feel as if I can still take them. After all, I am still a master of martial arts. A series of swift kicks to their groins, their jaws, should settle any unpleasantness. The dark-haired guy steps off to my left, and wipes at his slobbering mouth with the back of his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We don\u0027t want trouble either,\" he says. \"We\u0027re just looking for a good time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI catch his eye, and really do wish that my stare was still capable of burning into his brain. Seymour was right--my wishes have already settled into a pattern of wanting what I have lost. Yet I do my best to make my voice hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes a good time can cost you,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so,\" the blond guy says. \"You agree, John?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She looks like a freebie to me, Ed,\" John responds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027ve used their names in front of me. That is a bad sign. It means they\u0027re either too drunk to know better, or else they plan to kill me. The latter seems a distinct possibility since they clearly intend to rape me. I take another step back, and am tempted to reach for my gun. Yet I don\u0027t really want to kill them, especially since there is no need for their blood. Knocking them unconscious is my preference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, it is my second preference. Surviving is my first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you touch me I\u0027ll scream,\" I warn them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one\u0027s going to hear you down here,\" John says as he reaches out to grab me. \"Take her, Ed!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey go for me simultaneously, John close on my left, Ed three feet in front of me. But it is John who reaches me first. He has pretty good reflexes for a drunk. Before I can twist away, he catches me in a bear hug. Briefly I struggle, and then go limp. When Ed closes within two feet, however, I shove back against John and jump up, lifting both my feet off the ground. Lashing out with the right, I catch Ed in the groin. He shouts in pain and doubles up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The bitch got me!\" he complains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Goddamn it!\" John yells in my ear. \"You\u0027re going to pay for that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn response I slash backward and up with my left elbow. The blow catches John square on the jaw and his hold on me loosens as he staggers back. In an instant I am free. Since Ed is still bent over, I do him the favor of kicking him in the face, breaking his nose. He drops to his knees, his face dark with blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help me, John,\" he moans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help him, John,\" I mock as John regains his balance and glares at me with death in his eyes. I gesture with my little finger. \"Come on, John. Come and get your good-time girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn charges like a bull. I leap up and lash out with my left foot in order to kiss his jaw with the heel of my boot. The only trouble is that my timing and balance are all off. I have not risen far enough off the ground. Instead of striking him in the face, I hit him just above the heart, and the blow has not nearly the power I anticipated. John is a big man, over two hundred pounds. He grunts in pain as I strike but he doesn\u0027t stop. The momentum of his charge brushes aside my leg and now it is me who is suddenly off balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrantically, I try to bring my left leg back in beneath me before I land but I am too late. With a thud, I topple on my right foot and hit the sand with the right side of my face. John is on me in a second, grabbing me from behind and pinning my arms mid?way up my spine. He\u0027s strong. My upper vertebrae feel as if they will explode. With his free hand he smacks me on the back of the head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are one nasty bitch,\" he swears as he presses my face into the sand. Straining, I twist my head to the side so that I can breathe and see what is going to happen to me. \"Ed, give me a hand with this whore. She looked like a good sport to begin with but I\u0027m afraid when we\u0027re done pleasing ourselves we\u0027re going to have to bury her in this spot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well let the crabs eat her,\" Ed agrees as he staggers over, still bleeding profusely from his smashed nose. Behind me, John reaches around for the button on my pants. That is something of a break because if he had just tried to pull my pants down from behind, he would have found the gun. Also, reaching around as he is, I realize, John is slightly off balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDigging in with my right knee and pushing off with the tip of my left foot, I shove up as hard as possible. The move catches John by surprise, and I momentar?ily break free and roll in the sand. But my freedom will be measured in fractions of a second if I don\u0027t take drastic action. Squirming onto my back, I see both John and Ed staring down at me with stupid grins. They look ten feet tall and as ugly as highway billboards. Together they reach for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait!\" I cry as I move my right hand slowly under my lower back. \"If I lie still and cooperate will you please not hurt me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey pause to think about that. \"You better lie still, bitch,\" John says finally. \"But you\u0027ve messed up my friend too much to just walk away from tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we might give you a chance to crawl away,\" Ed says wiping at his bloody face and picking at his broken nose all in the same move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t leave here crawling,\" I say in a different tone of voice as my hand finds the butt of the gun. Leaning slightly to the left I whip it out and point it at the good ol\u0027 boys. They stare at it, frankly, as if they have never seen a gun before. Then they both take a step back. Maintaining my aim, I take my time getting back to my feet. I speak gently. \"That\u0027s right boys,\" I say. \"No sudden moves. No screams for help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn chuckles uneasily. \"Hey, you got us, girl. You got us good. We give you that. But you know we didn\u0027t mean you no harm. We just drank a little too much and didn\u0027t know what we were doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We weren\u0027t going to hurt you none,\" Ed adds, sounding scared, as well he should. Still taking my time, I step within a foot of Ed and place the barrel of the gun between his eyebrows. His eyes get real big, and he wants to turn and run but I stop him with a faint shake of my head. To my left, John stands frozen in wonder and horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are both liars,\" I say in a cold voice. \"You were not only going to rape me, you were going to kill me. Now I am going to kill you because you deserve to die. But you should be grateful I\u0027m using a gun. A few nights ago I would have used my teeth and nails, and you would have died much slower.\" I pause. \"Say goodbye to John, Ed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEd is consumed with murderer\u0027s remorse. \"Please!\" he says, his voice cracking. \"I have a wife and kid back home. If I die, who will take care of them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve got two kids back home,\" John says passion?ately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I am unmoved. Being human has not made me more gullible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, I usually do not kill when I have the upper hand. I do not kill for pleasure. But I know these two will harm others in the future, and therefore it is better that they die now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is better for your children not to grow up having to imitate trash like you,\" I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEd\u0027s face is awash with tears. \"No!\" he cries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I say, and shoot him in the head. He falls hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn the gun on John, who slowly backs away, shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have mercy,\" he pleads. \"I don\u0027t want to die.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you should never have been born,\" I reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoot him twice in the face. In the eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet that is all I do. The ancient thirst is gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leave their bodies for the crabs. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/phantom-the-last-vampire-4/page-2.html","bookId":2513,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:17:35 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:17:35 PM"}
