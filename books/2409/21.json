She wanted to talk to Ringer about the pilot\u0027s hat they\u0027d found. That hat was critical to the story, as it was now becoming clear to Casey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had a sudden thought, and called Norma. \"Listen, I think I know where that fax came from about the in-flight magazine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it matter?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.

The War Room was full of people, there were guys setting up big lights on stands, and taping sheets of cardboard to the ceiling. Other men were taping microphones to the table, and to the walls. There were two camera crews setting up, each with two cameras - four cameras in all, pointing in opposite directions. Two chairs had been arranged at opposite sides of the table, one for her, one for the interviewer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought it was inappropriate that they were taping in the War Room; she didn\u0027t know why Marder had agreed to it. She thought it was disrespectful that this room, where they worked and argued and struggled to understand what happened to planes in flight, had been turned into a prop for a television show. And she didn\u0027t like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey was off-balance; everything was happening too fast. The makeup woman kept asking her to keep her head still, to close her eyes, then open them. Eileen, Marder\u0027s secretary, came over and thrust a manila folder in her hands. \"John wanted to make sure you had this,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey tried to look at the folder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" the makeup woman said, \"I need you to look up for a minute.

Still looking up for makeup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Barbara,\" Malone said, to the makeup woman. \"Make sure you get the, uh ...\" And she waved her hand toward Casey, a vague gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will,\" the makeup woman said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get the what?\" Casey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A touchup,\" the makeup woman said. \"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone said, \"I\u0027ll give you a minute to finish here, and then Marty should be in to meet you, and we\u0027ll go over the general areas we\u0027re covering, before we start.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone went away.

The makeup woman jumped back, and Casey saw Marty Reardon standing in front of her. Reardon was in shirtsleeves and a tie. He had Kleenex around his collar. He held out his hand. \"Marty Reardon. Nice to meet you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for your help with this,\" Reardon said. \"We\u0027ll try to make it as painless as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know of course we\u0027re on tape,\" Reardon said. \"So if you have a bobble or something, don\u0027t worry; we\u0027ll just cut it.

He smiled, and turned away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe makeup woman moved back in front of her again. \"Look up,\" she said. Casey stared at the ceiling. \"He\u0027s very nice,\" the makeup woman said. \"A sweet man, underneath it all. Dotes on his children.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard Malone call out, \"How much more time, guys?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone said, \"Five minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sound?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re ready.

I better get some base on that, to take the blue out.\" She turned back to her box, got a piece of sponge with makeup on it. She began to daub it onto Casey\u0027s neck. \"I can\u0027t tell you how much I see, in my line of work, and the woman always denies it. But domestic violence has to be stopped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey said, \"I live alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, I know,\" the makeup woman said. \"Men count on your silence.

Casey turned to the right. A man came over and said, \"Ma\u0027am? Can I give you this?\" and he thrust a plastic box into her hands, with a dangling wire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Casey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look right, please,\" the makeup woman said. \"It\u0027s the radio mike.

Then she took Casey into the bathroom, and showed her how to thread the mike wire up under her blouse, through her bra, and clip it to her lapel. The wire ran back down inside her skirt, then back up to the radio box. The woman hooked the box to the waistband of Casey\u0027s skirt, and turned the power on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember,\" she said. \"From now on, you\u0027re live. They can hear whatever you say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Casey said. She adjusted her clothes. She felt the box pinching at her waist, the wire against the skin of her chest She felt cramped and uncomfortable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe makeup woman led her back into the War Room, holding her by the elbow. Casey felt like a gladiator being taken into the arena.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the War Room, the lights were glaring. The room was very hot. She was led to her seat at the table, told to watch she didn\u0027t trip over the camera cables, and helped to sit down. There were two cameras behind her. There were two cameras facing her. The cameraman behind her asked her to please move her chair an inch to the right. She did. A man came over and adjusted her microphone clip, because he said there was clothing noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the opposite side, Reardon was attaching his own microphone without assistance, chatting with the cameraman. Then he slipped easily into his chair. He looked relaxed, and casual. He faced her, smiled at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing to worry about,\" he said. \"Piece of cake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone said, \"Let\u0027s go, guys, they\u0027re in the chairs.

That\u0027s why we test our airframes to three times the design life - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very great concern. Do you think that\u0027s an adequate response?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey hesitated. What was he saying? \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said. \"I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t follow - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t the company have an obligation to build safe aircraft?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. And we do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not everyone agrees,\" Reardon said. \"The JAA doesn\u0027t agree. The Chinese may not agree ... Doesn\u0027t the company have an obligation to fix the design of an aircraft which it knows to be unsafe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What I mean,\" Reardon said, \"is that what happened to Flight 545 has happened before. Many times before. On other N-22s. Isn\u0027t that true?\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Casey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No?\" Reardon\u0027s eyebrows shot up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Casey said, firmly. This was the moment, she thought. She was stepping off the cliff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is the first time?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well then,\" Reardon said, \"perhaps you can explain this list.\" He produced a sheet of paper, held it up. She knew from across the room what it was. \"This is a list of slats episodes on the N-22, going back to 1992, right after the plane was introduced. Eight episodes. Eight separate episodes. Transpacific is the ninth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not accurate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, tell me why.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasey went through, as briefly as she could, the way Airworthiness Directives worked. She explained why they had been issued for the N-22. How the problem had been solved, except for foreign carriers that had failed to comply. How there had not been a domestic incident since 1992.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReardon listened with continuously raised eyebrows, as if he had never heard such an outlandish thing before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So let me see if I understand,\" he said. \"In your view, the company has followed the rules. By issuing these air directives, which are supposed to fix the problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Casey said. \"The company has fixed the problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has it? We\u0027re told slats deployment is the reason people died on Flight 545.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s incorrect\" She was now dancing on a tightrope, working a fine and technical line, and she knew it If he asked her, Did the slats deploy? she would be in trouble. She waited breathlessly for the next question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReardon said, \"The people who told us the slats deployed are wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know how they\u0027d know,\" Casey said. She decided to go farther. \"Yes, they\u0027re wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fred Barker, former FAA investigator, is wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The JAA is wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, as you know, the JAA is actually delaying certification over noise emissions, and - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s just stay with this for a moment,\" Reardon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered what Gershon had said: He\u0027s not interested in information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The JAA is wrong?\" he said, repeating the question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis called for a complicated answer, she thought. How could she put it briefly? \"They\u0027re wrong to say the aircraft is unsafe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So in your opinion,\" Reardon said, \"there is absolutely no substance to these criticisms of the N-22.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s correct. It is an excellent aircraft.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A well-designed aircraft.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A safe aircraft.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d fly in it\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whenever possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your family, your friends ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No hesitation whatsoever?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what was your reaction, when you saw the tape on television from Flight 545?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe \u0027II get you saying yes, then hit you from left field,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Casey was ready for it. \"All of us here knew that it was a very tragic accident. When I saw the tape, I felt very sad for the people involved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You felt sad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t it shake your conviction about the aircraft? Make you question the N-22?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because the N-22 has a superb safety record. One of the best in the industry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of the best in the industry...\" Reardon smirked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Mr. Reardon,\" she said. \"Let me ask you. Last year, forty-three thousand Americans died in automobile accidents. Four thousand people drowned. Two thousand people choked to death on food. Do you know how many died in domestic commercial transports?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReardon paused. He chuckled. \"I must admit you\u0027ve stumped the panel.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/airframe/page-21.html","bookId":2409,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:22 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:22 AM"}
