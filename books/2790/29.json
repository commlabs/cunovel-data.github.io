South Juneau sounded like a conference room, but it was really a gigantic dance hall that could hold thousands. \"Don\u0027t remind me,\" he said, and slouched off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone left him alone—the palace grounds were safe enough, and he was on the opposite side… all the guests were streaming into the place from the north.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood and watched the bees (a phrase he\u0027d picked up from Nicky and, dammit, they were people, he had to stop calling them \"castlebees\" in his head) setting up for the reception. It looked like there were bowls and bowls of flowers just… everyplace. And since the ceremony was going to be brief (thank you, thank you God), they were already setting food out, protectively covered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned to see the stacks and stacks of miniature hot dogs—in wee buns an inch long!—and hamburgers, and mini lobster rolls. He could see the cakes being rolled out to their tables: a four-tiered groom\u0027s cake (they had made an extra one for the wedding as well as the rehearsal banquet) in dark chocolate, and decorated with thin white ribbons circling each tier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndthe cake, the one Christina had insisted on making and decorating: four enormous Swiss vanilla tiers covered in ice-blue frosting—but it was that flat kind of frosting—fondue? Fondant? Anyway, it looked as smooth as an ice pond, and had been decorated with sugared pine cones and chocolate twigs. He wasn\u0027t a sweets person, but the cake really was something. He could have gobbled half a tier on his own, if he wasn\u0027t scared he\u0027d puke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got a little closer, puzzled because he kept seeing the same set of initials on everything: BR. Hanging banner-like from trees, on tables, on doors and windows—Rough? Bring Roses?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt hit him: duh. Baranov/Rivers. That was… nice. He guessed. Okay, it was a little creepy. He was sure someone had told him his and Alex\u0027s initials would be splashed all over everything on the big day, but to see it in real life was… weird.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey! Loser!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sheldon! Over here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked; there were the Grange twins in all their tuxedo\u0027d glory—he couldn\u0027t remember Teal ever wearing anything but a T-shirt and jeans. He grinned; truly a momentous occasion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for the real food,\" Teal said with his mouth full as Shel approached. \"Have you had one of these baby hot dogs? They\u0027re awesome!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn response to a pleading look from one of the caterers, Shel said, \"Knock it off, assface. Those\u0027re for the reception.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, we\u0027re guests of honor,\" Teal bragged, while his twin helped the caterer cover the hot dogs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True, but keep your ham-handed fingers off the food until it\u0027s time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must admit, you\u0027re the best looking valet I\u0027ve ever seen,\" Crane teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut your cake hole. Both of you.\" He pressed the heels of his hands to his eyes. \"Why didn\u0027t I elope?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because Alex never would have agreed. She\u0027s all about duty, that girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t remind me.\" The three friends fell silent and watched the caterers filling long clear vases with white calla lilies and place them on the tables. Kathryn had been right; the weather was a miracle. Lots of sun, no wind. It could have been August instead of early fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared down at the closest table, reading the top of the little box which served as a treat and a place holder, the name written in beautiful, spidery black script: Susan Sarandon. Oh, for Christ\u0027s sakes. That couldn\u0027t be right, could it? How did the Baranovs even know Susan Sarandon?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s in the boxes?\" Teal asked, poking one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop that.\" Crane smacked his brother\u0027s hand, which saved Shel the trouble. \"You take the top off, and there\u0027s a petit four inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell is a petit four?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a miniature cake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. You can have mine, bro. I\u0027ll just take an extra baby burger instead. Listen, Shel, while I\u0027ve got you alone, is it true you\u0027re giving dirt as wedding favors?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrane sighed, again saving Shel the trouble. \"They\u0027re tulip bulbs, you ignoramus. The guests take them and plant them in the next week or so—they\u0027re a fall bulb, as everyone knows—and next spring a physical symbol of Shel and Alexandria\u0027s love will bloom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yawn,\" Teal said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thinkmy wife\u0027s idea was charming.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, okay, don\u0027t burst a blood vessel, you big sissy. I still say they look like little clumps of dirt. You can dress them up in all the netting you want: they still look yuck.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, anything that\u0027s different looks \u0027yuck\u0027 to you, so be quiet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, since you got made first chair and moved to this place—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And knocked up your wife,\" Shel added helpfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"—you\u0027re more annoying than usual. And that\u0027s saying something!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrane ignored his brother\u0027s jibes. \"Sheldon, are you all right? Do you need anything?\" Crane pinched his brother and hissed, \"We\u0027re his groomsmen, we\u0027re supposed to be asking questions like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, do you need your back wubbed, wittle bitty groomey? How about a pony ride?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, for the first time that day. \"I\u0027m fine, you morons. Well, moron, singular. I just came out to get some air. There\u0027s too many people fluttering around me inside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like that Kathryn girl? She could flutter around me all she wants.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up, Teal, she\u0027s underage. And I guess…\" He sighed. \"I guess I better get used to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Underage girls?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, all the people.\" He sighed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeal rolled his eyes. \"Is this the part where we\u0027re supposed to cry for you because you\u0027re going to be stupidly wealthy for the rest of your life, Prince Sheldon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer, instead, he changed the subject: \"Did the rest of your sibs get here okay? Your folks?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup. Fourth row. They\u0027re in there right now, waiting to be impressed by the greatness that is us,\" Teal bragged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And my mother, for some unfathomable reason, wants to feel Jenny\u0027s stomach,\" Crane added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d feel Jenny\u0027s stomach,\" Teal leered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrane frowned at his brother. \"You best get up there, then, Shel. Or wherever you\u0027re supposed to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, don\u0027t want the king giving you a black eye. Did you see the size of that guy? And he\u0027s the one marrying you! I mean, you know. Not marrying you. Doing the ceremony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex wanted it that way.\" Shel shrugged. \"It makes the, uh, coronation part easier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ahhhhh. So they really just stick a crown on your head at the end and call it good?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The king does, yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you okay? You look kind of weird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My breakfast isn\u0027t agreeing with me. Why don\u0027t you guys go on in? I\u0027ll be right behind you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiving him identical doubtful looks, the twins left. Shel watched the bees—the palace employees—for a moment longer, then started the long death march toward the South end of the palace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he could have taken Alex without the title and the money and the employees and the royal protocol, he would have. Since he couldn\u0027t have her without all that other bullshit, he\u0027d be the Prince of Alaska. But boy, oh boy, it would take some getting used to. Prince Sheldon! Ha!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt must be love, he thought, more than a little shocked. It must be! Because I would never—I could never have—but I can\u0027t live without her, either. Just the thought of it… he shivered again, and again, it had nothing to do with the weather.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait! Oh, wait!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew that voice, and instantly turned. There was the Princess of Alaska running toward him,racing toward him, her full white skirt caught up in her hands so she could navigate the turf better—he could see her matching shoes, pointy toes and diamond straps and all—he could see her hair jiggle, only the Baranov pearls keeping it from falling down past her shoulders in the dark cloud he knew well, so well he dreamed about it every night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay,\" she gasped, finally reaching him. She pressed a hand to her bodice and fought for breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jeez, Alex, I don\u0027t think that dress is for, you know, running laps,\" he said mildly, but couldn\u0027t help grinning, he was so glad to see her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean… it\u0027s okay… you lasted longer… I don\u0027t want you to go… I\u0027ll hate it… but I understand…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I think… if you go… you\u0027re a coward…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just getting some air, you nimrod! I\u0027m not ducking out of the wedding.\" He looked around and observed that they were, for the moment, utterly alone. It was the perfect setting for an escape. \"Uh, but I can see why you thought that. No, I was getting freaked out in there and came out here for a bit while I still could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" she panted. \"If I had… the energy… I\u0027d be mortified… for thinking… the worst…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not like I haven\u0027t given you reason. Hey, do you need to sit down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m… fine. That\u0027s—okay.\" She gulped a deep breath and swayed on her feet for a second, then seemed to recover from her mad dash across the lawn. \"Well. Sorry. I saw you out the window and—and it\u0027s possible I jumped to conclusions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trying to corral me before I could make my getaway, huh?\" He looked her up and down. \"My God, who could ever leave you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dropped her skirts, covering her shoes, and he saw the dress in more detail now: off the shoulder, long sleeves, little white flowers sewn into the neckline, gigantic meringue skirt. Against the fall trees and the dying grass, she was the brightest thing on the grounds, the most beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis princess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled at him and reached up to see if her hair was in place; it was, secured firmly by the braids of pearls. Another set was around her neck, lustrous against her creamy skin: the Baranov pearls, inherited from her great-great grandmother. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-royal-pain-alaskan-royal-family-2/page-29.html","bookId":2790,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:35:41 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:35:41 PM"}
