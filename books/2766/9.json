We\u0027re digging up rocks that may have been here for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. Maybe our holy forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob walked on these rocks we\u0027re digging. It\u0027s not an easy task, and now the sun has come up and hits me in the face. I wish I had my sunglasses, because now I\u0027m squinting. I\u0027ll be able to blame my premature wrinkles on this rock-digging experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel a tickle on the back of my hand. I need to scratch it, but don\u0027t want to stop digging because I want to show Avi that I can be a good ditch-diggin\u0027 soldier and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t want to small-yamean-small back to the base. I really want a ride.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the itching bugs me so much I can\u0027t ignore it, I hesitate and look down at my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh! My! God!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a HUGE creepy black spider crawling on me. I throw down the shovel and shake my hand vigorously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"AAAHHHHHH!\" I scream and run, not able to stop the heebie jeebies. I keep shaking my hand just in case the creepy crawler is still on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if it bites me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if it\u0027s poisonous?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if it crawls up my sleeve?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if it already laid creepy spider babies on me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" Jess cries out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you hurt?\" Miranda yells over my screams in a concerned voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did something bite you?\" Nathan calls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t stop to explain, because I\u0027m still jumping around and shaking like a madwoman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m barely aware of Avi attempting to subdue me. I flail my arms and slap his hands away because I\u0027m still worried the spider is on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then Avi twirls me around so my back is against his and he wraps his arms around me so tight I can\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m breathing hard and I\u0027m sweaty and smelly and totally freaked out from spiders and embarrassment because everyone is watching me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I\u0027m in Avis arms, which are like a vice holding me still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wasitacrav?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not a crab,\" I gasp. Do crabs even live in the desert?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t say crab. Ah\u0027crav. .. a, uh...\" He\u0027s searching his brain for the English word so he can translate. \"Scorpion?\" he finally says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you hurt?\" he asks. He\u0027s so calm I stop struggling against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. It was...\" I choke out the word. \"A spider.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A spider!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone else laughs hysterically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... I think it was a black widow. It was really big! And hairy! And it was crawling on my SKIN!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Black widows aren\u0027t hairy,\" he says, but instead of making fun of me like everyone else, my boyfriend turns me around, takes my hands in his, and inspects them. \"It\u0027s gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if it crawled up my shirt?\" I say, squirming. I swear I feel little prickly legs on my back. It could be my imagination, like when you\u0027re talking about lice and you start scratching. But it really feels like spiders are crawling all over me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t panic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI keep squirming. \"I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s still on me. Avi, help me. Please,\" I beg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout hesitation, he picks me up like I weigh close to nothing and calls out for Liron to follow us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hurries behind a large boulder. \"Take your shirt off. Nobody can see you.\" He turns around, giving me privacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI unbutton the shirt as fast as I can while Liron stands next to Avi. Her back is to me, too. I think he called her over because he didn\u0027t want to have our entire unit see him take me somewhere alone. He doesn\u0027t want us to get in trouble again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiron is our chaperone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t believe I need a chaperone when I\u0027m with my boyfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, it\u0027s off. I\u0027m not going back out there in my bra.\" I mean, Avis seen me with just a bra on, but not in public.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi holds out his hand, his back still to me. \"Give it to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My bra?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glances back at me, even though we both know one word from Liron to Sergeant B-S about him seeing me with no shirt will probably have him doing pushups again. \"No. The shirt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I hand it to him, I watch him carefully inspect it from top to bottom. He turns it inside out, making sure its free of creepy crawlers. He even opens the pockets and inspects those.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tosses the shirt back to me. \"There\u0027s nothing on it, or in it. Trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" I say. If there\u0027s anyone at the top of my trust list, it\u0027s Avi. Now that I\u0027m calm, I can\u0027t confirm that the spider was hairy. And maybe it wasn\u0027t as big as I made it out to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiron shakes her head. \"If I didn\u0027t see it with my own two eyes, I wouldn\u0027t believe it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can\u0027t you believe?\" I ask her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Avi Gefen inspecting a shirt for a spider.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" My boyfriend is my hero; why shouldn\u0027t he help me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiron chuckles. \"Avi tells everyone else in SayeretTzefa to suck it up, whether they\u0027re tired, bleeding, or throwing up from exhaustion. But with you... and a little spider...\" She shakes her head. \"I don\u0027t get it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter I have the shirt back on, they both turn around to face me. Avi points to me as he talks to Liron. \"You saw her--she was freaking out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you came to her rescue. She\u0027s ruining your reputation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s my girlfriend,\" Avi says defensively. \"What would you want me to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Treat her like a soldier, like you treat the rest of us. She didn\u0027t sign up to be rescued, she signed up to be a trainee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t about Amy. It\u0027s about us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait. One. Second. Did he just say \"us\" as in Avi and Liron \"us\"... not Amy and Avi \"us\"?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, shit.\" Avi rubs his temples as he squeezes his eyes shut. \"I didn\u0027t mean to say that in English.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear, deep and strong, slices through my body. I\u0027m afraid to ask, but can\u0027t stop myself more than I can stop myself from breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\"What are you saying, Avi? Are you two, like, a couple or something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 11\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emilk + meat \u003d not kosher my boyfriend + kissing another girl\u003d not kosher\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn to Liron for answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Avi, tell her,\" Liron says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\"Yeah. Tell me.\" When he hesitates, my entire body goes numb. \"It doesn\u0027t matter, anyway, because Nathan and I have been dating since February, after you left. I wanted to tell you, but I didn\u0027t want to upset you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhew. I can\u0027t believe I got the lie out without choking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrunching stones alerts us that someone is about to join us. It\u0027s Nimrod. He looks at Liron, then Avi, then me. \"Hakol Beseder --everything okay? No more spiders?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No spiders,\" I say. \"And everything is just hunky-dory. Right, Avi?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lied to Liron and Avi because I didn\u0027t know what else to do. I\u0027m in total shock. \"Was everything Avi told me back in Chicago about how much he loves me a complete lie? \"Were all those letters he wrote me lies, too? He knows I have trust issues because my parents never married and I didn\u0027t even have a relationship with my father until last year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo wonder Avi doesn\u0027t want me here. He wants to be free to have his relationship with Liron on base and then have me, his American girlfriend, on the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUgh, the thought of it makes me sick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI storm back to my group, leaving Nimrod with the lovebirds. Okay, Avi and Liron don\u0027t look or act like lovebirds, but he\u0027s obviously dating her behind my back. And I\u0027m obviously the idiot girlfriend thinking it was worth it to spend time at a military boot camp to see my boyfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I\u0027m stuck. I would quit, but I begged my dad to sign me up and there\u0027s no turning back now. If I leave with my tail between my legs, I can just imagine what my dad will say. \"I told you you\u0027re too young to have a serious relationship with Avi. I told you the program wouldn\u0027t be easy, and you couldn\u0027t handle military life. Next time listen to your father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glare at anyone laughing at me. Every comment, every snicker, is like nails dragging down a chalkboard, making me cringe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJess runs up to me. \"Amy, are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine,\" I snap back, which earns me a weird look from my best friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you get bitten?\" Miranda asks me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I don\u0027t want to talk about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur team hasn\u0027t finished digging the hole yet, although all the other teams have. Nimrod\u0027s team is giving themselves high fives, so I assume they\u0027re the winners of the challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiron orders her team into formation without looking my way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi peers down into our pathetic, three-inch-deep hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We lost,\" Nathan tells him. \"Which isn\u0027t a big surprise considering we had one less person and no team leader after you guys disappeared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not going back until our ditch is finished,\" Avi informs us. \"No giving up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike he did with our relationship?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Avi left Chicago, I haven\u0027t thought of anyone else. I haven\u0027t been remotely interested in another guy because I know he\u0027s The One. He said we were going to be together forever, that he wanted to marry me one day. I believed him, which makes me the dummy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eListen, I know I have to finish high school, go to college, and get a job. But I also thought my future included Avi, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA big army truck comes into sight, kicking up desert dust in its wake. Nimrod and his team hop on and, within a minute, are out of sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy team members are still shoveling, per Avis orders. I\u0027m purposely ignoring anyone with a name that starts with an A, has an /at the end, and a Vin the middle. I can feel his eyes boring into my back like Superman\u0027s X-ray vision. But my boyfriend isn\u0027t Superman, at least not anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now, to save face, I have to pretend Nathan and I are in love. I\u0027m not sure Nathan will go for the charade. Dare I tell him? He\u0027s afraid enough of Avi as it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvi tells the rest of the teams to file out and head back to base while we finish digging. Tori is shoveling, although she\u0027s not going fast and I think we might be here for a few days. We\u0027re all so hot and sweaty I wonder if skin can actually melt off of our bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amy...\" I hear Avis voice from behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is someone talking to me?\" I ask Jess. \"Because all I hear is hot air.\" I tap on my ears with my palms, pretending to clear my ear canals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiranda taps me on the shoulder and nudges me to turn around. \"Avi\u0027s right behind you, Amy. Maybe you really did get bit by that spider and it affected your hearing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks, Miranda. Not. The girl is not too quick on social cues, that\u0027s for sure. I love Miranda to death (okay, not to death ... that\u0027s a bit over the top), but she can definitely use lessons in how to not take everything so literally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn to Avi with a cool smile on my face. \"Did you want something, O Unfaithful One?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t say that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not? It\u0027s true, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You walked away before I could explain, Amy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So explain now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not with an audience.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have no choice, Avi, do we?\" I focus on kicking a large rock. \"Did you sleep with her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll conversations immediately stop. Everyone waits for Avi to answer. I think the air even stops moving (although I can\u0027t say that\u0027s a big feat because there wasn\u0027t a breeze to begin with).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I didn\u0027t sleep with her--\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you kiss her?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/how-to-ruin-your-boyfriend-s-reputation-how-to-ruin-3/page-9.html","bookId":2766,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:08 PM"}
