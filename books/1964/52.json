You’ve got to be careful what you put outside your door, but Chase will tell you all about that, so don’t worry. We haven’t lost anyone to bears in two, three years now.” He laughed, and Lesley didn’t know if he was teasing or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallowed uncomfortably and pushed the thought out of her mind. “I think moose are interesting creatures,” she said conversationally, remembering Lori’s comment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We get ’em every now and then, but not often.” Once more it was Pete who answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time they landed, ninety minutes later, Lesley was both exhausted and worried. After they’d parked the plane in a hangar and unloaded their luggage, Pete drove them to a cabin nestled in a valley of alder, willow and birch trees. Lesley didn’t see any other cabins along the way, but then she wasn’t expecting Chase to live on a suburban street. Neighbors would have been welcome, but he didn’t seem to have any within walking distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See you in the morning,” Pete said, delivering two of the suitcases to the porch. He left immediately, after slapping Chase on the back and making a comment Lesley couldn’t hear. She figured Pete was issuing some unsolicited marital advice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re meeting him in the morning?” Lesley asked. Chase had told her he needed to be back at work. But she’d assumed he wouldn’t have to go in right away, that he’d be able to recover from his travels first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s picking me up,” Chase said. “I have to check in. I won’t stay long, I promise.” They were standing on the porch and Lesley was eager to get a look at her new home. The outside didn’t really tell her much. She’d seen vacation homes that were larger than this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase unlocked the door and turned to her, sweeping her off her feet as if she weighed no more than the suitcase. His actions took her by surprise and she gasped with pleasure when she realized he was following tradition by carrying her over the threshold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesley closed her eyes and reveled in the splendor of being in his arms. They kissed briefly, then Chase carried her into the bedroom and they sat on the edge of the bed together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This has been the longest day of my life,” Lesley said with a yawn. “I could kill for a hot bath and room service, but I don’t think I’d stay awake long enough for either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve dreamed of having you in this bed with me,” he said in a low voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesley cupped his face and tenderly kissed his lips. “Come on. I’ll help you bring in the luggage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nonsense,” Chase countered. “It’s no problem. I’ll get it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesley didn’t object. While Chase dealt with their suitcases, she could explore their home. The bedroom was cozy and masculine-looking. The walls were made of a light wood—pine, she guessed—with a double closet that had two drawers below each door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA picture was the only thing on the dresser and Lesley knew in an instant that the couple staring back at her from the brass frame were Chase’s parents. The bed was large, too big for the room, but that didn’t bother her. The floor was wood, too, with several thick, braided throw rugs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a small guest room across the hall, simply furnished with an iron bedstead and a chest of drawers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoving into the living room, Lesley admired the huge rock fireplace. It took up nearly all of one wall. He had a television, DVD player and music system. She’d known there was electricity; she’d made a point of asking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe furniture was homey and inviting. A recliner and an overstuffed sofa, plus a rocking chair. Chase loved books, if the overflowing bookcases were any indication. Between two of them stood a rough-hewn desk that held a laptop computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA microwave caught her eye from the kitchen counter, which was a faded red linoleum, and she moved in that direction. The huge refrigerator and freezer stood side by side and looked new, dominating one wall. Everything else, including the dishwasher and stove, were ancient-looking. She’d make the best of it, Lesley decided, but she was putting her word in early. The kitchen was often the heart of a home and she intended to make theirs as modern and comfortable as possible. From the looks of it, she had her work cut out for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well?” Chase asked from behind her. “What do you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think,” she said, turning and hugging him around the middle, “that I could get used to living here with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase sighed as if she’d just removed a giant weight from his shoulders. “Good. I realized as soon as I saw Pete that I hadn’t really prepared you for Twin Creeks. It’s not what you’d call a thriving metropolis.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve noticed. Are there neighbors?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Some,” he answered cryptically. He held her close, and she couldn’t read his expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nearby?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not exactly. So, are you ready for bed?” he asked, changing the subject, but not smoothly enough for her not to notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve decided I’ll have a bath, after all.” She planned to soak out the stiffness of all those hours cooped up inside planes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s one problem,” he said, sounding chagrined. “I don’t have a tub.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesley stared at him. “Pardon?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s only a shower. It’s all I’ve ever needed. At some point we can install a bathtub, if you want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay. I’ll manage.” A shower instead of a bath was a minor inconvenience. She’d adjust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase needed to make a couple of calls and while he was busy, Lesley showered and readied for bed. Her husband of four days undressed, showered and climbed into bed with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sheets were cold and instinctively Lesley nestled close to Chase. He brought her into the warm alcove of his arms, gently kissing her hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good night,” Lesley whispered when he turned off the light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“’Night.” The light was off, but the room was still bright. She’d adjust to sunlight in the middle of the night, too, Lesley reasoned. But it now seemed that she was going to have to make more adjustments than she’d realized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rolled onto her side and positioned the pillow to cradle her head. She was too tired to care, too tired to do anything but sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase, however, had other ideas.…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesley smiled softly to herself as he whispered in her ear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know what I want.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” She slipped onto her back and lifted her arms to him in welcome. She did know what he wanted. And tired or not, she wanted the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase was awakened by the alarm. His eyes burned and he felt as if he were fighting his way out of a fog before he realized what he needed to do to end the irritating noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesley didn’t so much as stir. He was pleased that the buzzer hadn’t woken her. He’d like nothing better than to stay in bed and wake his wife and linger there with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat wasn’t possible, though. Not this morning. There’d be plenty of other mornings when they could. He looked forward to those times with pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase slipped out of bed and reached for his jeans and shirt. Wandering into the bathroom, he splashed cold water onto his face in a desperate effort to wake up. He’d report in to work, do what needed to be done and leave again. It shouldn’t take more than thirty minutes, an hour at the most. There was a chance he’d be home before Lesley even woke up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled the whole time he made himself a cup of coffee. He sat in the recliner and laced his boots, put on a light jacket and let himself out the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePete was just pulling into his yard when Chase walked down the two front steps. He sipped from his coffee in its travel mug and walked toward his friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Trouble,” Pete greeted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It isn’t going to take long, is it?” Chase knew the answer to that already. Nothing was ever easy around the pump station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I gotta tell you,” Pete said to him good-naturedly, “your arrival back couldn’t have been more timely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase released a four-letter word beneath his breath. He’d wait an hour or so, call Lesley and explain. This certainly wasn’t the way he wanted their lives together to begin, but it couldn’t be helped. Too bad she’d learn the truth so soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLesley woke to blazing sunshine. That was how she’d gone to sleep, too. She turned her head toward Chase, surprised to find the other half of the bed empty. Swallowing her disappointment, she tossed aside the covers and sat on the edge of the mattress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChase had parked their suitcases by the bedroom door. Lesley decided to unpack first, and by the time she was through, she hoped Chase would be back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dressed, then looked in the cupboard for something to eat. As soon as Chase returned, they’d need to do some grocery shopping. Since he’d been gone for several weeks, they needed to restock the essentials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang while she was munching on dry cereal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hello,” she answered enthusiastically, knowing it was likely to be Chase; she was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lesley, I’ve run into some problems here at the station.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will you be long?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know. Do you think you can manage without me for a while?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Of course.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can send Pete if you’d rather not be alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be fine, and I certainly don’t need a baby-sitter.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hesitated. “Don’t go wandering off by yourself, all right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry. With bears and wolves roaming around, I won’t be taking any strolls.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry about this,” he said regretfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re sure?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chase, stop worrying, I’m a big girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve got to go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know. Just answer one thing. We need groceries. Would you mind if I took your truck and drove into town and picked up a few items?” She eyed her bowl of cereal. “We need milk, eggs and so on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard him curse under his breath. “Groceries. I didn’t think of that. Hold off, would you, for a little while? I’ll be back as soon as I can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know.” She was lonely for him already, but determined to be a helpmate and not a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother hour passed and she’d completely reorganized their bedroom. She consolidated the things in Chase’s dresser to make room for hers and hung what she could in his cramped closet. When Chase had a few minutes to spare, she needed him to weed out anything he didn’t need. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/an-engagement-in-seattle/page-52.html","bookId":1964,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:38 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:38 AM"}
