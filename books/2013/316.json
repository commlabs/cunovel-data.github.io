For one who is poison, there is great pleasure in anguish. In wild longing. In the meaningless explorations of delighted surrender, subjugation-well, subjugation that was in truth domination-no point in being coy here. I surrender in order to demand. Relinquish in order to rule. I invite the rape because the rapist is me and this body here is my weapon and you, my love, are my victim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause heroes die. As Udinaas says, it is their fate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice that was Mockra, that was the Warren of the Mind, had not spoken to her since that first time, as if, somehow, nothing more needed to be said. The discipline of control was hers to achieve, the lures of domination hers to resist. And she was managing both. Just.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this the echoes of the past served to distract her, lull her into moments of sensual longing for a man now dead, a love that could never be. In this, even the past could become a weapon, which she wielded to fend off the present and indeed the future. But there were dangers here, too. Revisiting that moment when Trull Sengar had drawn his sword, had then set it into her hands. He wished me safe. That is all. Dare I create in that something more? Even to drip honey onto desire?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeren Pedac glanced up. The fell gathering-her companions-were neither gathered nor companionable. Udinaas was down by the stream, upending rocks in search of crayfish-anything to add variety to their meals-and the icy water had turned his hands first red, then blue, and it seemed he did not care. Kettle sat near a boulder, hunched down to fend off the bitter wind racing up the valley. She had succumbed to an uncharacteristic silence these past few days, and would not meet anyone’s eyes. Silchas Ruin stood thirty paces away, at the edge of an overhang of layered rock, and he seemed to be studying the white sky-a sky the same hue as his skin. ‘The world is his mirror,’ Udinaas had said earlier, with a hard laugh, before walking down to the stream. Clip sat on a flat rock about halfway between Silchas Ruin and everyone else. He had laid out his assortment of weapons for yet another intense examination, as if obsession was a virtue. Seren Pedac’s glance found them all in passing, before her gaze settled on Fear Sengar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrother of the man she loved. Ah, was that an easy thing to say? Easy, perhaps, in its falsehood. Or in its simple truth. Fear believed that Trull’s gift was more than it seemed; that even Trull hadn’t been entirely aware of his own motivations. That the sad-faced Edur warrior had found in her, in Seren Pedac, Acquitor, a Letherii, something he had not found before in anyone. Not one of the countless beautiful Tiste Edur women he must have known. Young women, their faces unlined by years of harsh weather and harsher grief. Women who were not strangers. Women with still-pure visions of love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis realm they now found themselves in, was it truly that of Darkness? Kurald Galain? Then why was the sky white? Why could she see with almost painful clarity every detail for such distances as left her mind reeling? The Gate itself had been inky, impenetrable-she had stumbled blindly, cursing the uneven, stony ground underfoot-twenty, thirty strides, and then there had been light. A rock-strewn vista, here and there a dead tree rising crooked into the pearlescent sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt what passed for dusk in this place that sky assumed a strange, pink tinge, before deepening to layers of purple and blue and finally black. So thus, a normal passage of day and night. Somewhere behind this cloak of white, then, a sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sun in the Realm of Dark? She did not understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear Sengar had been studying the distant figure of Silchas Ruin. Now he turned and approached the Acquitor. ‘Not long, now,’ he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned up at him. ‘Until what?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, his eyes fixing on the Imass spear. ‘Trull would have appreciated that weapon, I think. More than you appreciated his sword.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnger flared within her. ‘He told me, Fear. He gave me his sword, not his heart.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He was distracted. His mind was filled with returning to Rhulad-to what would be his final audience with his brother. He could not afford to think of… other things. Yet those other things claimed his hands and the gesture was made. In that ritual, my brother’s soul spoke.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked away. ‘It no longer matters, Fear.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘It does to me.’ His tone was hard, bitter. ‘I do not care what you make of it, what you tell yourself now to avoid feeling anything. Once, a brother of mine demanded the woman I loved. I did not refuse him, and now she is dead. Everywhere I look, Acquitor, I see her blood, flowing down in streams. It will drown me in the end, but that is no matter. While I live, while I hold madness at bay, Seren Pedac, I will protect and defend you, for a brother of mine set his sword into your hands.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-316.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
