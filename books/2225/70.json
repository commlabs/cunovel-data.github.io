His business affairs were handled by a firm in Arden Hills—I believe that’s where he met his wife. However, I was his personal attorney.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The night he disappeared you called him. You left a message on his answering machine. ‘Something’s gone wrong. Better call me ASAP.’”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The police already asked about that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was about the ball, the Entrepreneur’s Club Ball to be held tomorrow evening. We were having trouble with one of the bands, but it was straightened out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, your call had nothing to do with the Family Boyz.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Family Boyz? What’s that? A rock band?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A street gang, a little more interesting than most.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know nothing about them.” Casselman looked me straight in the eye, not daring even to blink. I took it as proof he was lying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bruder had dealings with them. So did Cook.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t believe that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t believe it or don’t want to?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t imagine what kind of business dealings David and Napoleon would have had with such people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were their lawyer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But not their keeper.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nonetheless.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you have any proof of their involvement? Any evidence that would stand up to scrutiny?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In court, you mean? No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then, Mr. McKenzie, you should be more careful with your accusations.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sounds like good advice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was meant to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd here I always thought lawyers were supposed to be subtle. I went back on the offensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where were you Tuesday night, the night Jamie was murdered?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasselman waited one, two, three, four, five beats and said, “You should be a trial lawyer. Excuse me.” He moved to the entrance of the kitchen. He called, “Lila? Lila, would you come down here for a moment?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasselman took another pull of his beer while we waited. Lila was wearing an oversize black T-shirt that barely brushed her thighs and nothing more that I could see. I tried not to stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is Mr. McKenzie,” Casselman told her. “He’s investigating Jamie’s murder.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The paper said David did it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Apparently the paper is wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, who then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what he’s here to find out.” Casselman asked me to repeat my question. I knew I was wasting my time but I asked anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was here, with Lila.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is that true, Mrs. Casselman?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” she said without hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All night.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How about Friday night between eleven and midnight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Friday night? Isn’t that”—Casselman looked to his wife—“The night we went …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To the movies and for a drink afterwards,” Lila finished. “We went to see the new Tom Hanks film. It was a date. We hardly ever have time for dates anymore.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasselman nodded in agreement. He and Lila danced well together. I knew I wasn’t going to get anything more out of either of them until they were separated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you for your time, Mr. Casselman. Mrs. Casselman. I can let myself out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasselman wasn’t as anxious to see me depart as I would have guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mr. McKenzie, do you own your own business?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m self-employed,” I admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then you certainly qualify for the Northern Lights Entrepreneur’s Club Ball. It’s tomorrow night at the Minnesota Club. Have you received an invitation?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It must have been lost in the mail.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please plan on attending,” he told me. “I’ll arrange to have an invitation sent to you by messenger.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s gracious of you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s going to be a great party. A great send-off for Napoleon and the others.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sure it will be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be looking forward to seeing you there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough all of this, Lila stood mute, looking first at her husband, then at me, watching our conversation like it was a tennis match. Just for the hell of it, I decided to serve her a high, hard one. I glanced at my watch even though I had no interest in the time and said, “I have to go. I promised to meet someone at Rickie’s.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked directly into Lila Casselman’s eyes when I said that last part. Her smile froze and her face went pale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m unfamiliar with Rickie’s. Is that a club?” Casselman asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. In St. Paul.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I confess that I rarely get to St. Paul.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should make more of an effort,” I told him. Lila stared at me without blinking. “Thank you for your time and trouble.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No trouble at all,” he replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLila didn’t say anything and probably wouldn’t until the blood returned from her feet. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-hard-ticket-home-mac-mckenzie-1/page-70.html","bookId":2225,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:01:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:01:26 PM"}
