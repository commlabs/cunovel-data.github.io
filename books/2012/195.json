Me and Stormy and Truth and that Trell? ‘I hear you,’ he whispered, studying the dog. ‘The way you wince when you get up after another night on cold ground. I see you limping at day’s end, Bent.’ You and me, we’re both breaking down. This journey will be the last of us, won’t it? You and me, Bent. The last of us . ‘I’ll take your side when the time comes,’ he said. ‘In fact, I will die for you, dog. It’s the least I can do.’ The promise sounded foolish, and he looked round to make certain no one else was near. Their only company was the other dog, Roach, digging frantically at some mouse hole. Gesler sighed. But who says my life’s worth any more than this dog’s? Or that its life is worth less than mine? Who stands around measuring these things? The gods? Hah! Good one. No. We do, and that’s the sorriest joke of all .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling chilled, he shook himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBent sat down on his left, yawned with a grinding, grating sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler grunted. ‘We seen a lot, ain’t we? All that grey in our muzzles, hey?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAren Way. The sun was hot, but we could barely feel it. Truth brushing the flies from the wounds. We don’t like death. It’s as simple as that. We don’t like it .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard soft footpads and turned to see Destriant Kalyth approaching. When she settled down on Bent’s other side and rested a hand on the beast’s head, Gesler flinched. But the dog did not move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grunted. ‘Never seen Bent accept that from anybody, Destriant.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘South of the Glass Desert,’ she said. ‘We are soon to enter the homeland of my people. Not my tribes, but our kin. The Elan lived on the plains that enclose the Glass Desert on three sides. My own clan was to the north.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then you can’t be certain they’re all dead – these ones in the south.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. ‘I am. The voice-slayers from Kolanse hunted down the last of us. Those that didn’t die from the drought, I mean.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Kalyth, if you got away, others did too.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I hope not,’ she whispered, and she set to massaging the cattledog, along the shoulders, down the length of the beast’s back to the hips, and under her breath she chanted something in her own language. Bent’s eyes slowly closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler watched her, wondering at the meaning of her reply. Whispered like a prayer. ‘It seems,’ he muttered after a moment, ‘that us survivors all share the same torment.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced up at him. ‘That is why you and the Shield Anvil always argue. It’s like watching your children die, isn’t it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA clutch of pain inside made him look away. ‘I don’t know why the Adjunct wants it this way, but I do know why she’s keeping it all inside. She has no choice. Maybe none of us do – we are what we are, and no amount of talking or explaining is going to make a difference to anything.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBent was lying down now, breathing slow in sleep. Kalyth slowly withdrew her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You just took away his pain, didn’t you?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. ‘My people kept such animals. As children, we all learned the songs of peace.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘“Songs of peace,”’ Gesler mused. ‘It’d be nice to hear a few more of those in the world, wouldn’t it?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Not any time soon, I fear.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They just found you, didn’t they? In their search for people to lead them.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, straightening. ‘It wasn’t fair. But I’m glad of it, Mortal Sword.’ She faced him. ‘I am. And I am glad of you. And Stormy – and these dogs. Even Grub.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut not Sinn. No one is glad of Sinn. Poor girl – she probably knows it, too . ‘Sinn lost her brother,’ he said. ‘But she might have been unhinged long before that. She was caught in a rebellion.’ He glanced down at Bent. ‘No one came through it unscarred.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘As you said, the curse of surviving.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Making us no different from the K’Chain Che’Malle,’ he observed. ‘I’m surprised it took them so long to realize it.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Gunth Mach’s mother realized it, and for that she was deemed insane. If we do not fight together, we end up fighting each other. She died before she could witness the fruits of her vision. She died believing she had failed.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Kalyth, the winged assassin, Gu’Rull, does it remain guarding us?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked skyward, eyes narrowing at the Jade Strangers. ‘I sent the Shi’gal to scout our approach.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Into Kolanse? Isn’t that risky?’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-195.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
