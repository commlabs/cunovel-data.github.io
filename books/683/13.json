If he had only known beforehand what she wanted he could have come prepared . . . that was the way with women! \u0026nbsp;Always thinking of themselves! \u0026nbsp;And now? \u0026nbsp;Of course she wouldn’t stump up after his refusing her. \u0026nbsp;What would his father say if he came to hear of it? \u0026nbsp;And he must speak to him soon, for these chaps were threatening to County Court him if he didn’t pay. \u0026nbsp;Those harpies in Vere Street were quite nasty . . . ’ \u0026nbsp;He wondered if he could work Stephen for a loan.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He walked on through the woodland path, his pace slower than before. \u0026nbsp;‘How pretty she had looked!’ \u0026nbsp;Here he touched his little moustache. \u0026nbsp;‘Gad! \u0026nbsp;Stephen was a fine girl anyhow! \u0026nbsp;If it wasn’t for all that red hair . . . I like ’em dark better! . . . And her being such an infernal boss!’. . .

And now, just because she didn’t tell me what she wanted to speak about, or the governor didn’t give me a hint so that I might be prepared, I have gone and thrown away the chance. \u0026nbsp;After all it mightn’t be so bad. \u0026nbsp;Stephen is a fine girl! . . .
