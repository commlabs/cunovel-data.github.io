{"id":88816,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"\u003cp\u003eStay here,\" Rashel said sharply, but Hannah ran with the rest of them toward the front of the house. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould hear a ferocious snarling and barking outside-a very familiar sort of sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNilsson and the other CIA guys were running around. They looked grim and efficient, moving fast but\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enot frantically. Hannah realized that they knew how to do this sort of thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t see Lupe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe snarling outside got louder, building to a volley of short barks. There was a yelp-and then a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003escrambling noise. After a moment of silence there came a sound that lifted the hair on Hannah\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eforearms-a wild and eerie and beautiful sound. A wolf howling. Two other wolf voices joined the first,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echording, rising and falling, interweaving with each other. Hannah found herself gasping, her entire skin\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshivering. Then there was one long sustained note and it was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow,\" the tiny blond called Gillian whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah rubbed her bare arms hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front door opened. Hannah felt herself looking toward the ground, but nothing four-legged came in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead it was Lupe and two guys, all disheveled, flushed, and grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was just some scouts,\" Lupe said. \"We ran them off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scouts from Maya?\" Hannah said, feeling a tightness in her stomach. It really was true, then. Maya was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etrying to storm the house to get to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLupe nodded. \"It\u0027ll be okay,\" she said almost gently. \"But I think all of you better stay inside today. You\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecan watch movies or play games in the game room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah spent the day talking with the Circle Daybreak members. The more she found out about them,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe more she liked them. Only one thing made her uncomfortable. They all seemed to defer to her-as if,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomehow, they expected her to be wiser or better because of her former lifetimes. It was embarrassing,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebecause she knew she wasn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to keep her mind off Thierry... and Maya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn\u0027t easy. That night she found herself walking restlessly through the house. She wound up in a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elittle anteroom on the second floor that looked down on the enormous living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can\u0027t relax?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lazy murmur came from behind her. Hannah turned to see Ash, his lanky elegant body propped\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eagainst a wall. His eyes looked silver in the dimly lit room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really,\" Hannah admitted. \"I just wish they\u0027d find Thierry. I\u0027ve got a bad feeling about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stood for a moment in silence. Then Ash said, \"Yeah, it\u0027s hard to be without your soulmate. Once\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou\u0027ve found them, I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah looked at him, intrigued. The way he said that...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spoke hesitantly. \"This morning Thea said you were all here because you had human soulmates.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked across the room at French doors that led to a balcony. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And-well...\" Maybe she\u0027s dead, Hannah thought suddenly. Maybe I shouldn\u0027t ask. \"And you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewant to know where mine is,\" Ash said. \"I didn\u0027t mean to pry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. It\u0027s okay.\" Ash looked out at the darkness beyond the French doors again. \"She\u0027s waiting-I hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve got some things to put right before I see her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t seem scary anymore, no matter how his eyes changed. He seemed-vulnerable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure she is waiting,\" Hannah said. \"And I\u0027ll bet she\u0027ll be glad to see you when you\u0027ve put things\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eright.\" She added quietly, \"I know I\u0027ll be glad to see Thierry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at her, startled, then smiled. He had a very nice smile. \"That\u0027s true, you\u0027ve been in her shoes,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehaven\u0027t you? And Thierry\u0027s certainly tried to make up for his past. I mean, he\u0027s been doing good works\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor centuries. So maybe there\u0027s hope for me after all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said it almost mockingly, but Hannah caught an odd glistening in his eyes. \"You\u0027re like her, you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknow,\" he added abruptly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like my-like Mary-Lynnette. You\u0027re both... wise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Hannah could think of something to say to that, he nodded to her, straightened up, and went\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eback into the hallway, whistling softly through his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah stood alone in the dim room. For some reason, she felt better suddenly. More optimistic about\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think I\u0027ll be able to sleep tonight. And tomorrow, maybe Thierry will be here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe clamped down hard on the rush of hope that filled her at the thought. Hope... and concern. After\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eall she\u0027d said to him, she couldn\u0027t be absolutely sure how Thierry would receive her. What if he doesn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewant me after all? Don\u0027t be silly. Don\u0027t think about it. Go outside and get a breath of air, and then go to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, of course, she realized just how stupid she had been. She should have known that getting a breath\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof fresh air only led to one thing in her life. But at the moment it seemed like a good idea. Lupe had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewarned her not to open any outside doors-but the French doors only led to a second-floor balcony\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eoverlooking the backyard. Hannah opened them and stepped out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNice, she thought. The air was just cool enough to be pleasant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom here she could look across dark stretches of grass to flood-lit palm trees and softly splashing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efountains. Although she couldn\u0027t see Thierry\u0027s people, she knew they were out there, stationed around the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egrounds, watching and waiting. Guarding her. It made her feel safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing can get to the house with them around it, she thought. I can sleep just fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was about to turn and go back inside when she heard the scratching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came from above her. From the roof. She glanced up and got the shock of this particular lifetime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a bat hanging from the roof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bat. A bat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA huge bat. Upside down. Its leathery black wings were wrapped around it and its small red eyes shone\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eat her with reflected light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWild thoughts tumbled through Hannah\u0027s mind, all in a fraction of an instant. Maybe it\u0027s a decoration...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eno, idiot, it\u0027s alive. Maybe it\u0027s somebody to guard me. God, maybe it\u0027s Thierry....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut all the while, she knew. And when the instant of paralysis passed and she could command her body\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eagain, she sucked in a deep breath to scream an alarm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe never got the chance to make a sound. With a noise like an umbrella opening, the bat unfolded its\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewings suddenly, displaying an amazingly large span of black membrane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same moment something like sheet lightning seemed to hit Hannah, a blinding surge of pure mental\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eenergy. She saw stars, and then everything faded to darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head, Hannah thought slowly. And my back. In fact, she hurt all over. And she was blind-or she had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher eyes shut. She tried to open them and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enothing changed. She could feel herself blinking, but she could only see one thing. Blackness. Utter,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecomplete blackness. She realized then that she\u0027d never seen real darkness before. In her bedroom at\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enight there was always some diffused light showing at the top of her curtains. Even outdoors there was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ealways moonlight or starlight, or if it were cloudy, the reflection of human lights, however faint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was different. This was solid darkness. Hannah imagined she could feel it pressing against her face,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eweighing down on her body. And no matter how wide she opened her eyes or how fixedly she stared,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe couldn\u0027t see even the slightest glimmer breaking it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will not panic, she told herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was hard. She was fighting an instinctive fear, hardwired into the brain since before the Stone Age.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll humans panicked in complete blackness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust breathe, she told herself firmly. Breathe. Okay. Now. You\u0027ve got to get out of here. First things first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you hurt?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t tell. She had to shut her eyes in order to sense her own body. As she did, she realized that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe was sitting up, instinctively huddling into herself to keep safe from the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay. I don\u0027t think you\u0027re hurt. Let\u0027s try standing up. Very slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was when the real shock came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t stand up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could move her arms and even her legs. But when she tried to lift her body, even to shift position\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eslightly, something bit into her waist, keeping her immobile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a crawling feeling of horror, Hannah put her hands to her waist and felt the rough texture of rope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m tied. I\u0027m tied....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was something hard against her back. A tree? Her hands flew to feel it. No, not a tree-too\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eregular. Tall, but squarish. A post of some kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rope seemed to be wound many times around her waist, tightly enough that it constricted her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebreathing a little. It bound her securely to the post. And then it fastened above or far behind her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomewhere-she couldn\u0027t find any knots with her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt felt like very strong, very sturdy rope. Hannah knew without question that she wasn\u0027t going to be able\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto wiggle out of it or untie it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe post seemed very sturdy, too. The ground under Hannah was dirt and rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m alone, she thought slowly. She could hear her own gasping breath. I\u0027m all alone... and I\u0027m tied here\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein the dark. I can\u0027t move. I can\u0027t get away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaya put me here. She left me to die all alone in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a while, then, Hannah simply lost control. She screamed for help and heard her voice echo oddly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled and twisted at the rope with her fingers until her fingertips were raw. She threw her whole\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebody from one side to the other, trying to loosen the rope or the post, until the pain in her waist made her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estop. And finally she gave in to the galloping fear inside her and sobbed out loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had never, ever, felt so desolate and alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, though, she cried herself out. And when she\u0027d gasped to a stop, she found that she could\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethink a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eListen, girl. You\u0027ve got to get a grip. You\u0027ve got to help yourself, because there\u0027s nobody else to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t the cool wind voice or even the crystal voice-because they were both just part of her now. It\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas Hannah\u0027s own mental voice. She had accepted all her past selves and their experiences, and in return\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe felt she could call on at least some of their wisdom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, she thought grimly. No more crying. Think. What can you tell about your situation?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not out in the open. I know because there\u0027s no light at all and because of the way my voice echoed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m in a big... room or something. It\u0027s got a high ceiling. And the floor is rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGood. Okay, do you hear anything else?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah listened. It was hard to concentrate on the silence around her-it made her own breathing and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eheartbeat seem terrifyingly loud. She could feel her nerves stretch and fray... but she held on, ignoring\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher own noises and trying to reach out into the darkness with her ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she heard it. Very far away, a sound like a faucet dripping slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell? I\u0027m in a big black room with a rock floor and a leaky faucet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShut up. Keep concentrating. What do you smell?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah sniffed. That didn\u0027t work, so she took long breaths through her nose, ignoring the pain as her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emidsection pressed against the rope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s musty in here. Dank. It smells damp and cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, it was very cold. Her panic had kept her warm before, but now she realized that her fingers were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eicy and her arms and legs were stiff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, so what have we got? I\u0027m in a big black refrigerated room with a high ceiling and a stone floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it\u0027s musty and damp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cellar? A cellar without windows?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she was just fooling herself. She knew. The skin of her face seemed to sense the pressure of tons of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erock above her. Her ears told her that that musical dripping was water on rock, very far away. Her nose\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etold her that she wasn\u0027t in any building. And her fingers could feel the natural irregularity of the ground\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunderneath her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t want to believe it. But the knowledge crowded in on her, inescapable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m in a cave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cave or a cavern. Anyway, I\u0027m inside the earth. God knows how deep inside. Deep enough and far\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eenough that I can\u0027t see any light from an entrance or vent hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery deep inside, her heart told her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was in the loneliest place in the world. And she was going to die here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah had never had claustrophobia before. But now she couldn\u0027t help feeling that the mass of rock\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003earound and above her was trying to crush her. It could fall in at any minute, she thought. She felt a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ephysical pressure, as if she were at the bottom of the ocean. She began to have trouble breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to get her mind off it. She refused to turn into that screaming, gibbering thing in the darkness\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eagain. Worse than the thought of dying was the thought of going insane down here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThink about Thierry. When he finds out you\u0027re missing he\u0027ll start looking for you. You know that. And he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewon\u0027t give up until he finds you. But I\u0027ll be dead by then, she thought involuntarily. This time, instead of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efear, the idea of her death brought a strange poignant loneliness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother life where I missed him, she thought. She blinked against tears suddenly. Oh, God. Great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s so hard. So hard to keep hoping that someday it\u0027s going to work out. But I\u0027ll meet him again in my\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enext life. And maybe I won\u0027t be so stupid then; I won\u0027t fall for Maya\u0027s tricks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027ll be harder for him, I guess. He\u0027ll have to wait and get through the years day by day. I\u0027ll just go to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esleep and eventually wake up somewhere else. And then someday he\u0027ll come for me and I\u0027ll remember . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e. and then we\u0027ll start all over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI really did try this time, Thierry. I did my best. I didn\u0027t mean to mess things up. Promise me you\u0027ll look\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor me again. Promise you\u0027ll find me. I promise I\u0027ll wait for you. No matter how long it takes. Hannah shut\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher eyes, leaning back against the post and almost unconsciously touching the ring he\u0027d given her. Maybe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enext time she\u0027d remember it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly she didn\u0027t feel sad or afraid anymore. Just very tired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes still shut, she grinned weakly. I feel old. Like Mom\u0027s always complaining she feels. Ready to turn\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethis old body in and get a new...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought broke off and disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas that a noise?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHannah found herself sitting up, leaning forward as far as the rope would allow, straining her ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought she\u0027d heard... yes. There it was again. A solid echoing sound out in the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sounded like footsteps. And it was coming closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, yes. I\u0027m rescued, I\u0027m saved. Hannah\u0027s heart was pounding so hard that she could hardly breathe to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyell. But at last, just as she saw a bobbing point of light in the blackness, she managed to get out a hoarse\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esquawk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thierry? Hello? I\u0027m over here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light kept coming toward her. She could hear the footsteps coming closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was no answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thierry... ?\" Her voice trailed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFootsteps. The light was big now. It was a beam, a flashlight. Hannah blinked at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart was slowly sinking, until it seemed to reach stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the flashlight was right in front of her. It shone in her face, dazzling her eyes. Another light\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esnapped on, a small camping lantern. Vision rushed back to Hannah, sending information surging to her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebrain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there was no happiness in it. Hannah\u0027s entire body was ice cold now, shivering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of course it wasn\u0027t Thierry. It was Maya.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope I didn\u0027t disturb you,\" Maya said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put down the lantern and what looked like a black backpack. Then she stood with her hands on her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehips and looked at Hannah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will not cry. I won\u0027t give her the satisfaction, Hannah thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know vampires could really change into bats,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaya laughed. She looked beautiful in the pool of lantern light. Her long black hair fell in waves around\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher, hanging down her back to her hips. Her skin was milky-pale and her eyes looked dark and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emysterious. Her laughing mouth was red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was wearing designer jeans and high-heeled snakeskin boots. Funny, Hannah had never noticed any\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof Maya\u0027s clothes before. Usually the woman herself was so striking that it was impossible to focus on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehow she was dressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not all vampires can shapeshift,\" Maya said. \"But, then, I\u0027m not like other vampires. I\u0027m the first, my\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edarling. I\u0027m the original. And I have to say I\u0027m getting really sick of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe feeling is mutual, Hannah thought. She said, \"Then why don\u0027t you leave me alone? Why don\u0027t you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eleave me and Thierry alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because, then, my sweetpea, I wouldn\u0027t win. And I have to win.\" She looked at Hannah directly, her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eface oddly serious. \"Don\u0027t you understand that yet?\" she said softly. \"I have to win-because I\u0027ve given up\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etoo much to lose. It can\u0027t all be for nothing. So winning is all there is.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-soulmate-night-world-6/page-14.html","bookId":2080,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:27 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:31:27 PM"}
