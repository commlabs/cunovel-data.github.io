They are outrageous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What say you, Anthony?\" he asked Gideon\u0027s second in command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m against this union,\" the yellow-haired soldier muttered. \"Any man who would willingly give up his name disgusts me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I feel the same,\" Faudron interjected, his hawk-like face red with anger. \"Brisbane and Otis are despicable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nay, they\u0027re simply cunning old men who want the best for their clan. I\u0027ve known for some time now that they were going to come to me, and I\u0027ve had time to contemplate the matter. Tell me, Gideon, are you in favor of such a union?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you are,\" he replied. \"Your heart is too soft, Laird. It\u0027s a troubling flaw, that. I see the problems involved in such a union.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So do I,\" Ramsey said. \"But Otis is right; they have much to offer in return. More important is their cry for help, Gideon. Can you turn your back on them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis commander shook his head. \"Nay, the Boswells would slaughter them. However, I\u0027m most concerned about Proster and the other dissenters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve had time to come to terms with this union,\" Ramsey reminded him. \"You heard what Otis said. They first voted four months ago. Besides, we\u0027ll keep a close eye on them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mind\u0027s made up, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027ll welcome them into our clan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027ll be problems with our soldiers…\" Ramsey slapped Gideon\u0027s shoulder. \"Then we\u0027ll deal with them,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t look so bleak. Let\u0027s put the matter aside for now and join the festivities. Iain and Judith Maitland have been here since yesterday afternoon and I\u0027ve still not spoken to them. Let\u0027s hunt them down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is one more pressing matter you must attend to first.\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey dismissed Anthony and Faudron and then said to Gideon, \"I can see from your grin the matter isn\u0027t serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To your faithful soldier, Dunstan Forbes, the matter is very serious. You might as well sit down, Laird, for Dunstan has requested permission to marry Bridgid KirkConnell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey was suddenly weary. \"How many does this make now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon laughed. \"Including me, I count seven proposals in all, but Douglas swears there have been eight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey sat down and stretched his long legs out in front of him. \"Does Bridgid know about this latest suitor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet,\" he answered. \"But I have taken the liberty of sending for her. She\u0027s waiting outside, and you will at last meet the thorn in your side.\" After making the comment, he burst into laughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey shook his head. \"Do you know, Gideon, all this time I believed that when I challenged you tor the position of laird, I beat you fairly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon instantly sobered. \"But you did beat me fairly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you certain you didn\u0027t let me win just so you wouldn\u0027t have to deal with Bridgid KirkConnell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon laughed again. \"Perhaps,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll admit I like being in her presence, for she\u0027s a beautiful woman and a true delight to observe. She has a spirit few other women possess. She\u0027s quite… passionate… but alas, she\u0027s also as stubborn as a Buchanan. I\u0027m glad now she turned me down, for I have no wish to marry such a difficult woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is it that I have had to deny three proposals on this woman\u0027s behalf while I have been laird but I have yet to meet her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She sent her refusals from her uncle\u0027s home in Carnwath. I specifically remember telling you that I had given her permission to help her aunt with the new bairn. They, too, are here at the festival.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you told me, I\u0027ve forgotten,\" he said. \"I do remember her rejections though. She always sent back the same message.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve a feeling she\u0027ll say those very words today and Dunstan will join the rapidly growing ranks of the brokenhearted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My father is to blame for this nuisance duty I\u0027m now saddled with because he was the one who gave his promise to Bridgid\u0027s father that she could choose her husband. It\u0027s unthinkable to me that she alone will decide her future.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have a choice in the matter,\" Gideon said. \"You must honor your father\u0027s word. Bridgid\u0027s father was a noble warrior, and he was on his deathbed when he forged this promise. I wonder if he knew how stubborn his daughter was going to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey stood and then suggested Gideon call Bridgid inside. \"And stop grinning,\" he ordered. \"This is an important matter to Dunstan, and we shall treat it as such. Who knows? She may say yes to his proposal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, and it might rain pigs this afternoon,\" Gideon drawled as he folded back the flap of the tent. He hesitated, turned back to his laird, and in a soft voice asked, \"Have you ever had your head turned by a lady?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question exasperated Ramsey. \"No, I haven\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027d brace myself if I were you. I swear your head\u0027s going to spin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, Gideon\u0027s prediction almost came true, as Bridgid KirkConnell walked into the tent and literally knocked the wind out of her laird. She was an astonishingly pretty young lady, with fair skin, sparkling eyes, and sinfully curly, long honey-colored hair that floated beyond her shoulders. Her gentle curves were in all the right places, and Ramsey was surprised that there had been only eight proposals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made a curtsy, smiled ever so sweetly up at him, and said, \"Good day to you, Laird Ramsey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe bowed. \"So we meet at last, Bridgid KirkConnell. I\u0027ve had to break the hearts of several suitors on your behalf without benefit of knowing why those good men were so anxious to wed such an obstinate woman. Now I understand the reason my soldiers are so persistent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile vanished. \"But we have met before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"I assure you that if I had met you, I would not have forgotten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s true, we did meet,\" she insisted. \"And I remember our encounter as though it had taken place just yesterday. You had come home for your cousin\u0027s wedding. While my parents were attending the celebration, I decided to go swimming in the lake beyond the glen. You fished me out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clasped his hands behind his back and tried to concentrate on what she was telling him. Gideon hadn\u0027t exaggerated. She was an extraordinary woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And why did I fish you out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was drowning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t you know how to swim, lass?\" Gideon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Much to my surprise, I didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled again, and Ramsey\u0027s heartbeat began to race. He was stunned by his own reaction to the woman, for he couldn\u0027t seem to get past the fact that she was so damned pretty. It wasn\u0027t like him to behave like this—he wasn\u0027t a boy and he had certainly been in the presence of comely women before. It was her smile, he decided then. It was really quite infectious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wondered if Gideon was experiencing a similar response to the lass, and just as soon as he could find the discipline to stop gawking at her, he\u0027d look at his commander.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you didn\u0027t know how to swim, why did you go in the lake?\" Gideon asked, trying to make sense out of such an illogical act.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"Swimming didn\u0027t look difficult, and I was sure I could figure it out, but alas, I was mistaken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were a bold lass,\" Gideon commented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nay, I was stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were young,\" Ramsey offered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must have turned your parents\u0027 hair white,\" Gideon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was accused of doing just that on several occasions,\" she replied before turning her attention to Ramsey again. \"I understand why you don\u0027t remember. I\u0027ve changed in my appearance and it has been a long while. I\u0027m grown up now, but I\u0027m not obstinate, Laird. Truly I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You should have married by now,\" Ramsey said. \"And it would seem to me that you are being difficult. All of the men who have proposed marriage are fine and worthy soldiers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I\u0027m certain they are good men,\" she agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey took a step toward her. She took a step back, for she knew what was coming and wanted to be close to the opening of the tent so she could make a quick exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey noticed her glancing over her shoulder and thought she might be judging the distance to freedom. He maintained his serious demeanor, but it was difficult. Her panic made him want to laugh. Was marriage that repulsive to her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now another soldier has stepped forward to ask for your hand in marriage,\" he said. \"His name is Dunstan. Do you know him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"No, I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a good man, Bridgid, and he would certainly treat you well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? \"she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why what?\" he countered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why does he want to marry me? Did he give you a reason?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince Ramsey hadn\u0027t spoken to Dunstan personally, he turned to Gideon. \"Did he give you a reason?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commander nodded. \"He wants you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey could tell from the hesitation in Gideon\u0027s voice that he wasn\u0027t telling her the full story. \"Give her his exact words,\" he ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon\u0027s face colored. \"Surely the lass doesn\u0027t wish to hear every word, Laird.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think she does,\" Ramsey countered. \"And Dunstan expects us to speak for him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe commander scowled to cover his embarrassment. \"Very well then. Bridgid KirkConnell, Dunstan swears his love for you. He treasures your beauty and worships the very ground you… float upon… As God is my witness, those were his very words.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey smiled, but Bridgid wasn\u0027t the least bit amused. Insulted by the declaration, she tried to hide her feelings, knowing that her laird wouldn\u0027t understand. How could he? He was a man and, therefore, couldn\u0027t possibly know what was in her heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can this be?\" she asked. \"I have not even met this man, yet he declares his love for me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dunstan is a good man,\" Gideon told her. \"And I believe he means what he says.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s clearly infatuated with you,\" Ramsey added. \"Would you like time to consider his proposal? Perhaps if you were to sit down with him and discuss this matter—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she blurted out. \"I don\u0027t want to sit down with him, and I don\u0027t need time to consider his proposal. I would like to give my answer now. Would you please tell Dunstan that I thank him for his proposal, but…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what?\" Gideon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t have him\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose were the identical words she had used to deny eight other men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" Ramsey demanded, his irritation obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t love him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does love have to do with a marriage proposal? You could learn to love this man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will love the man I marry or I won\u0027t marry at all.\" After making her vehement statement, she took another step back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do I reason with such an absurd belief?\" Ramsey asked Gideon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" he replied. \"Where could she have gotten such notions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir rudeness in openly discussing her as though she weren\u0027t even there angered and frustrated her, but she tried to control her temper because Ramsey was her laird and she should respect his position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t change your mind about Dunstan?\" Ramsey asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"I won\u0027t have him,\" she repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, Bridgid, you are a stubborn lass to be sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing criticized a third time stung her pride, and she found it impossible to keep silent any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have been in your presence less than ten minutes, but in that short while you have called me obstinate, difficult, and stubborn. If you are through insulting me, I would like to join my aunt and uncle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey was astonished by her burst of anger. She was the first woman ever to speak to him in such a tone. Her behavior bordered on insolence, yet he couldn\u0027t fault her because he had said those very words to her, and they were insulting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will not speak to your laird with such disrespect,\" Gideon commanded. \"Your father would turn in his grave if he could hear you now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lowered her head, but Ramsey saw the tears in her eyes. \"Let\u0027s leave her father out of this,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But, Laird, at the very least she should apologize.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? I insulted her, though not deliberately, and for that I apologize.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer head snapped up. \"You apologize to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile was radiant. \"Then I must tell you I\u0027m sorry for being so contrary.\" She bowed, then turned and ran outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon frowned after her. \"She\u0027s a difficult woman,\" he remarked. \"I pity the man who does marry her, for he will have a fine battle on his hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey laughed. \"But what an invigorating battle it would be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon was surprised by the comment. \"And would you be interested in pursuing a—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shout stopped his question and he turned to the entrance just as a young soldier came running inside the tent. He was Emmet MacPherson\u0027s son, Alan, and he looked as though he had just seen the ghost of his father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Laird, come quickly. There\u0027s been a terrible accident… terrible… at the falls,\" he stammered, panting for breath. \"Your brother… oh, God, your little brother…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamsey was already running outside when Alan\u0027s next words hit him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Michael\u0027s dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Two\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEngland, in the reign of King John\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was hanging by a thread. In his desperation to hide from his enemy, the little boy had wrapped the old discarded rope he\u0027d found in the corner of the stables around and around the jagged boulder, then tied a tight triple knot the way his Uncle Ennis had taught him to do, and quickly, before he became plagued with second thoughts, slithered over the lip of the canyon on his belly with the rope twined around his left arm. Too late, he remembered he should have looped the rope around his waist and used his feet to brace himself the way he\u0027d seen the seasoned warriors do when they worked their way down Huntley Cliffs to their favored fishing spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy was in too much of a hurry to climb back up and start all over again. The rocks were as sharp as needles against his tender skin, and his chest and stomach were soon scraped raw and bleeding. He was sure that he would end up with scars, which would make him a real warrior, and while he thought that was a very good thing for a boy of his age to accomplish, he wished it didn\u0027t have to hurt so much. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ransom-highlands-lairds-2/page-5.html","bookId":1843,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:33:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:33:36 PM"}
