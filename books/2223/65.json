I’m a cop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFive minutes later we were walking under bright fluorescent lights through the bowels of the Victoria City Center, arms and legs moving in perfect synchronization, to a door labeled RECORDS. Along the way we passed Officer Andy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How’s it going?” I asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I sent off the paint chips to PDQ. My girlfriend said she’d try to expedite the search. We should get a hit right away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who the hell do you work for, Andy?” Mallinger wanted to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy looked from me to her like he wasn’t sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait here,” Mallinger told me when we reached the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd waited some more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Mallinger reappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s go,” she said as she brushed past me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“To see Chief Bohlig.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The file on Elizabeth Rogers. It’s missing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChief Bohlig was a tall man, creased like old leather and wearing a thermal shirt that was faded from frequent washings and threadbare along the collar and cuffs. We found him chopping wood in the backyard of his lake home with a double-bladed ax. There was a pile of logs sawed into eighteen-inch lengths on his right. One by one, he split them into halves and quarters and tossed them into an even more impressive pile on his left. He chopped the logs on a thick, wide tree stump. The snow was trampled all around him and wood chips were littered everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMallinger asked him why he didn’t hire someone younger to chop his wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve seen it before,” Bohlig said. “Seen it many times, how the soft life takes a man around the neck and slowly strangles him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you think?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never argue with a man who’s holding an ax.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good idea,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe watched him chop a few more logs. I grew impatient, yet said nothing. It was Mallinger’s play. Finally, she asked, “Chief, what happened to the file on Elizabeth Rogers?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBohlig kept chopping as if he hadn’t heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chief?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” Bohlig asked in between swings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Josie Bloom is dead. Suicide or murder, we’re not sure yet. We think it’s connected to the Rogers killing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The murder was over thirty years ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where’s the file?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gone. Destroyed. When I retired I purged a lot of old case files. I figured you could use the space.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t contain myself any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The only murder committed in the history of Victoria, Minnesota, and you destroyed the file?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBohlig ceased chopping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who are you?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t believe you threw away the file,” Mallinger said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBohlig continued splitting logs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Probably shouldn’t have,” he said. “I didn’t think it was important.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?” I said. “Some people might think you knew exactly how important it was and that’s why you destroyed it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat stopped Bohlig in midswing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“McKenzie,” Mallinger called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“McKenzie?” asked Bohlig. “Is that your name? McKenzie, you don’t know what you’re talking about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Enlighten me. What was in the file you didn’t want anyone to see?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then why did you destroy it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBohlig didn’t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You covered it up, didn’t you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have no right to say that to me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why? Why did you do it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBohlig continued to chop wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who killed Elizabeth?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he refused to answer, I stepped inside the arch of Bohlig’s swing, like a boxer getting close to an opponent. Bohlig could have split me in half if he had wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who killed Elizabeth?” I repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s in my report.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What report?” Mallinger asked. “The report you destroyed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBohlig didn’t answer. Instead, he shoved me out of range. I nearly tripped on a log. Mallinger and I continued to watch him work. After a few moments he stopped and leaned on his ax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know who killed Beth Rogers,” he said without looking at either of us. “The town is better off for my not knowing. Look at it. Look at what it’s become.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You sonuvabitch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“McKenzie,” Mallinger said. “Enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were a cop for forty years,” I told Bohlig, “and the one time you had a chance to get it right, you sold out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You don’t know anything about it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then tell us.” I waved at Mallinger. “Give us the benefit of your wisdom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBohlig continued to work on his woodpile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s in my report,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe drove back to town in silence. Not a sound emanated from the radio and for a moment I thought Mallinger might have switched it off. I had never heard a police radio so silent. But then we were in crime-free Victoria.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I looked up to him when I was a kid,” Mallinger said eventually. “I wanted to be a cop partly because of him.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pretty-girl-gone-mac-mckenzie-3/page-65.html","bookId":2223,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:52:55 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:52:55 PM"}
