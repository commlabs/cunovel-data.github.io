Compared to Zheng’s worry of the army causing trouble, the army feared they would get killed in order to cut off any news concerning the immortals. The army quickly withdrew from the valley once team China gained control of the place. The efficiency they showed was rarely seen in the Chinese army.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Looks like you have done a lot in the world. See how you scared people?” Zheng complained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No shit. Did you ever think Xuan knows how to hold back when he’s in danger? Or that he has this kind of emotion?” ChengXiao answered him with another question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uh. I asked a stupid question.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng continued to find conversational topics on the way they walked. At the same time, he inquired the events that happened during the past seven days. He was already too late to do anything but he showed his care over the team as the leader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Even though ChengXiao can’t keep his mouth to himself, he’s a reliable person. WangXia is a well qualified soldier. Zero’s the most dependable one. But Heng… his personality is not in sync with his strength. He’s the most concerning person in the team and he just revived YanWei. God knows if he can bear what has happened.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTeam China entered the tomb. The entrance appeared like a cave with carvings on the rims. The outside of the tomb looked weathered and worn but the inside was clean and dry. People had obviously cleaned the place up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonathan said with a smirk. “Fallen rocks and weeds covered the cave when we first found it. There were also rotten animal corpses and insect exoskeletons all over the ground. Took us a long time to clean everything up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of team China examined the area. The entrance was clean but dilapidated. There were traces of excavation though these traces were very faint. Anyone not a professional or had an aptitude for observation would mistaken these traces as a result of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXuan crawled on the ground and studied the traces in a very natural manner. Quite some time later, he said to Jonathan. “The traces seem to be left by man. They are severely weathered. Can you see the era that these traces come from with your knowledge?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonathan was surprised then carefully looked at the ground. “They should be from several thousand years ago.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Several thousand?” Xuan said in a serious tone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Several… about two thousand. I am not certain. You will need instruments and time to determine it. There’s no way to find out in a short period of time.” Jonathan scratched his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s enough.” Xuan got up from the ground and walked over to Zheng. “Do you remember what this place is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shanxi? China? Asia?” Zheng produced several geographical names.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXuan shook his head at every one of them. Zheng stopped guessing and looked straight at Xuan with curiosity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“God’s Realm.” Xuan adjusted his glasses then lowered his head. “This is God’s Realm, a place created by the Saints and Cultivators. If the cave is left by the Cultivators, I am curious whether this place is affected by the flow of time in this movie world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So what?” Zheng seemed more confused than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXuan rubbed his temples for a while before he said. “Let me put it this way. Do you think the existence of the movie world is logical?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question attracted everyone’s attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeng asked. “What’s not logical? How come we didn’t notice anything?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The existence of the whole world is not logical. This is the second greatest mystery of God’s Realm. Why are there independently existing worlds? That’s impossible! If this world truly exists, the question becomes… have the Saints and Cultivators achieved omnipotent? Can they create a whole universe and living beings? Or is the movie world nothing more than just another planet in the universe. The Saints and Cultivators only altered the planet to look like Earth? If this is the case, it will explain why we lose a moment of consciousness upon transporting into the movie worlds. That is the time needed to get us into this planet… However, I can not find an explanation for a few other questions. First is the distance. Second is the constellation. And third is the similarity of the worlds’ histories. Even in a virtually simulated world, history can not completely follow along of what happened on Earth. It’s statistically impossible. We can basically reject the possibility that the worlds are virtual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“However, if the movie worlds are real, then the Saints and Cultivators have the ability to create actual worlds… Now what kind of enemies would pose threats to them? Only the creators from beyond the world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Creators from beyond the world?” Everyone asked in sync.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA fanatical expression overtook Xuan’s face. He said in an exciting tone. “Only few people in the scientific field have this conjecture. Our universe is too harmonious with its many laws and theories. If even one law is wrong, like the force between protons and electrons are different, or gravitational force is different, our universe will cease to exist. The whole universe is created upon very extreme coincidences, countless number of coincidences. It’s impossible under the chaos theory. So some people come to believe that our universe and everything inside it are a program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You can imagine as our technology improves. We will eventually develop artificial intelligence. What if we let this artificial intelligence simulate a universe in a supercomputer and then give birth to beings with true intelligence, not the robots that you know of. However, these intelligent beings live in a world that’s nothing more than the supercomputer that you see. How would they see their universe? How would they become aware of our world? And similarly, how can you be sure we are not living inside a little box? Or enacting a story on someone’s book? Are the enemies of the Saints and Cultivators the creators of our box? Or are the enemies the viruses these creators sent into the supercomputer?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXuan walked ahead of everyone as he said. Then he sighed. “It’s a depressing theory that the universe we know of is nothing more than the product of a higher form of life… However, if it’s true then the Saints and Cultivators reached an interesting level. They could create worlds and living beings just like the creators. It’s likely that they have violated the creators’ taboo because they have attained a terrifying height. As a result, the creators attacked them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s easy to verify whether this world is real. Since the bug mission set up by the Cultivators also suffered from the weathering of time, then we aren’t under hypnosis, we aren’t in a virtual world that God drew our minds into like the Matrix. This is a real dimension, a real world. The Saints and Cultivators could create their own boxes or they had discovered the method of creating the boxes. God is probably the core of their box!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the rest of the team thought over his conjecture, they found that it explained a lot of the questions they had. All the messages left by the Saints and Cultivators mentioned their fear of their enemies. Even the demons and gods were only at the same level of the Saints. What did Saints who reached the highest form of life feared? It could only be something that still surpassed this highest form of life. Going by Xuan’s conjecture, the enemies were the creators of their universe!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s… shocking.” Zheng muttered. “However, it sounds possible… Say, do you think the Cultivators recorded the truth in this Sky Tower?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXuan’s showed a glimpse of expression on his face and then said bitterly. “Even if there is a record of the truth, we probably can’t obtain it. Sigh. Just try our best.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe group descended several hundred meters along the cave until they came into a bright wide and open area. The walls were covered with white glowing crystals. Strangely, this was the bottom of the cave. There was no more path ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-19-chapter-14-01\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-19-chapter-14-03\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-19-chapter-14-02","bookId":1512,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:20 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:20 AM"}
