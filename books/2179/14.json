{"id":99692,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"\u003cp\u003eEverything\u0027s a blur. School, chatting with my friends, playing happy families with Dervish and Juni. Life goes on as normal around me, and I take part, the way I always have. But I\u0027m not fully there. Always thinking about the moon, the cave, the tramp, Dervish (possibly) scheming behind my back. Waiting for the change to hit. Going to bed tense every night, lying in the dark, wondering if this is when I\u0027ll turn. Stiffening whenever one of my fingers twitches or my stomach growls. Terror when my lips lift back over my teeth in a wolf-life snarl-then relief when I realise I\u0027m only yawning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI discuss some of it with Dervish but I\u0027m reluctant to share everything. The more I think about it, the more positive I am-he called in the Lambs. I resent him for that. There\u0027s no real reason to. It\u0027s not like he\u0027s washing his hands of me. I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll be extra careful, that he won\u0027t let them act unless I\u0027m beyond saving. But why summon them so soon? He didn\u0027t with Bill-E. He kept them in the dark. Dealt with it himself while there was still hope. I was sure he\u0027d act the same way with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, I\u0027m different. We can\u0027t work the Lord Loss angle anymore. Dervish didn\u0027t call the Lambs in last time because he planned to fight for Bill-E\u0027s humanity. If he won, Lord Loss would have cured Bill-E. If he lost, they\u0027d have both been slaughtered by the demon master. Either way, no need for the Lambs. I\u0027m not that lucky. There\u0027s no get-out clause in my case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso there\u0027s the magic. Dervish can deal with a werewolf, but perhaps not one with magical powers. Maybe he\u0027s scared, isn\u0027t sure what I\u0027ll be capable of when I turn, doesn\u0027t feel he can handle me solo, wants the security of back-up. Perfectly logical if he does. I can\u0027t blame him for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even so, I feel betrayed and the feeling won\u0027t go away. I should talk with him, tell him I know he called in the Lambs, discuss my disappointment, give him the chance to explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I don\u0027t. Afraid to bring the subject out into the open, like when I first became aware of the magic inside me and kept it secret. Ludicrously hoping that I\u0027m wrong about the tramp, that things aren\u0027t at such an advanced stage, that I can still be saved. Figuring if I don\u0027t talk about it, maybe it will go away. Grubbs Grady-human ostrich!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA week to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday, at lunch, when we\u0027re alone, Reni asks if anything is wrong. I haven\u0027t been paying her the kind of attention she expects. She wants to know if I\u0027ve lost interest, if I\u0027m seeing or thinking about somebody else. She puts it lightly, tries to make a joke of it, but I can see the suspicion and hurt in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lie. Say things are the same as always. Make excuses. Tell her there\u0027s a lot of confusion in my life-Loch dying (not that I put it so bluntly), Juni moving in with Dervish. I even mention exams and the future, pretending I\u0027m worried about the direction I\u0027m taking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe buys it. Thinks I\u0027m going through a mid-teen crisis, that it\u0027s nothing to do with her. Willing to wait for my mood to improve. Confident I\u0027ll be back looking to put the moves on her once I sort through my problems. Never guessing that they might be the ripping-her-throat-open-with-my-teeth type of moves-if I turn into a werewolf next weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalking home slowly, watching for the tramp. I\u0027ve caught glimpses of him since that night at the cave, hanging around school, on the streets of Carcery Vale, once in the trees across from my bedroom window. But he\u0027s kept at a safe distance. No follow-up contact. Slips away if I try to approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m surprised he even spoke to me that once. Maybe it was an accident-late at night, standing guard in the forest, at the scene of a tragedy. Perhaps the mood affected him and he spoke without meaning to. I\u0027m sure even the executioners of the Lambs are prone to human slip-ups every now and then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThinking about the tramp and the Lambs as I let myself in. Wondering how they kill the werewolves. I imagine it\u0027s clinical and undramatic, probably a powerful poison, injected humanely. But I can\u0027t help playing out shock-horror scenes-hordes of Lambs dressed as tramps surrounding me, attacking me with machetes and clubs, a slow, humiliating, painful death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grubbs,\" Dervish calls as I\u0027m heading up the stairs, disrupting my train of morbid thoughts. \"Could you come see me when you\u0027re ready?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\" Up to my room. Toss my bag into a corner. Out of my uniform swiftly, into jeans and a baggy sweater seconds later. Jog back down in my socks to find Dervish and Juni sitting on one of the couches in the TV room, looking edgy and stern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a seat, wary. I look at them and they stare at me. A long, ragged silence. Then Dervish speaks quickly. \"I\u0027ve told Juni about you. About us. The family curse. What\u0027s been happening with you recently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blink slowly and glance at Juni. Can\u0027t tell what she\u0027s thinking. Wearing her most enigmatic counsellor\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought long and hard about this,\" Dervish says, leaning forward. \"It would have been easy to ask Juni to go away next weekend and keep her out of the loop. Easy and safe.\" He looks at her. She smiles briefly and lays a hand on his. \"But we need her help. I don\u0027t know why, but you\u0027ve stopped talking to me. This last week or two, you\u0027ve been withdrawn, moody, sullen. Maybe it\u0027s just fear. But I think there\u0027s more to it. You\u0027ve cut me out as if you have issues with me and that\u0027s not good. I need to know what you\u0027re thinking and feeling. I can\u0027t help you if I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on inside your head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think Juni can open me up,\" I say stiffly. \"Stick me on a couch, get into my brain, worm out the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" Dervish mutters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We only have your best interests at heart,\" Juni says. \"This is a troubled time for you. Dervish wants to help. I do too. If you have problems with your uncle-or with me-you should lay them out in the open. Or, if it\u0027s something you don\u0027t want to discuss with Dervish, perhaps you can tell me in private.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Patient to counsellor?\" I sneer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you like,\" she says calmly. \"I\u0027d rather talk informally as a friend, but if you prefer we can do it professionally, with the guarantee of confidentiality.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t mind,\" Dervish says. \"I just want to help you survive the next week. If I\u0027ve upset you and you don\u0027t want to tell me about it, fine. But you don\u0027t have to cut Juni out. Surely you can talk with her if not with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if there\u0027s no problem?\" I mumble. \"What if I\u0027m just scared to death that I\u0027m going to turn into a werewolf and don\u0027t feel like talking about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That would be entirely understandable,\" Juni says. \"But unless you\u0027re sure that\u0027s the case, you should discuss it with someone. Talking about your fears can be a highly positive experience. You know that, Grubbs. You\u0027re not an innocent child. Going through this alone is a bad call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Especially as you might not even be going through it,\" Dervish says. I look at him with a raised eyebrow. \"You mightn\u0027t be turning. Juni thinks...\" He stops and looks at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just because people in your family are victims of a disease which alters their bodies-I refuse to refer to them as werewolves, since that\u0027s a hysterical term-it doesn\u0027t mean you are going to change,\" Juni says. \"From what you\u0027ve described, it sounds as if you\u0027re in trouble, but it\u0027s by no means certain. This might be a mental problem, not a physical one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I\u0027m imagining things?\" I growl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps,\" Juni says. \"The mind can play tricks on the most ordinary people-and you\u0027re far from ordinary! To come through what you have... to see so much of the world-and other worlds-at such a young age... to lose your loved ones in a grisly fashion, then fight for your brother\u0027s life... what happened to us in Slawter... Your resilience amazes me. You\u0027re one of the strongest people I\u0027ve ever met and I\u0027m not saying that to stroke your ego. You\u0027re incredible, Grubbs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile crookedly, blushing, tears coming to my eyes. Part of me wants to leap up and hug her. Another part wants me to wave her compliment away and act cool. In the end I just carry on smiling, blushing and crying lightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But even the strongest of us has a breaking point,\" Juni says. \"Maybe Loch was yours. Or perhaps there\u0027s something else, a small upset you\u0027re not even aware of. It\u0027s possible you\u0027re turning-but it\u0027s also possible you\u0027re not. I want to try and find out. In a week we\u0027ll know for definite. But we can cover a lot of ground in a week. It could make a real difference if you\u0027re wrong about the change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if I\u0027m right?\" I ask tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuni beams. \"We\u0027ll just have to fire a silver bullet through the middle of your forehead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laugh loudly. Dervish does too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My sense of humour\u0027s rubbing off on her,\" Dervish chuckles proudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You say that like it\u0027s a good thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boys, boys,\" Juni tuts. \"Let\u0027s not get sidetracked. Grubbs, will you accept my offer of help? Talk with me privately if you have something you don\u0027t want to say to both of us? Accept me as a counsellor if not a friend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost blurt it out and tell them I know about the Lambs, which is why I\u0027ve been so surly. But that would mean a confrontation with Dervish, admitting to his face that I feel he betrayed me. I can\u0027t do that, not after all the good things he\u0027s done for me. If I\u0027m wrong, it would hurt him to hear me speak that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I take Juni up on her offer, lower my head to hide my thoughts, and mutter, \"Yeah, talking with you sounds good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Juni says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nice one,\" Dervish adds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we pretend for a while that everything\u0027s fine and all our problems have been solved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong talks with Juni at school in the day and at home in the evenings. Not just about Loch. We cover all kinds of ground-my past, parents, Gret, Lord Loss, the institute, life with Dervish, Bill-E changing into a werewolf, Slawter. All the things we didn\u0027t discuss before, when she was only interested in helping me deal with Loch\u0027s death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe spend a lot of time on magic, the buzz of energy I sometimes feel in my gut, what I\u0027ve done with it, my mind-set when the magic was flowing through me. With Dervish\u0027s permission, Juni runs some tests, trying to tap into my magical core, to find out what\u0027s going on inside, what I might be capable of doing. But she comes up blank. If the magic\u0027s still there, it\u0027s buried too deep for her to find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe also spends a lot of time researching the Demonata, pumping Dervish for information, finding out all she can about them. She\u0027s especially hot on Lord Loss-if he\u0027s able to cure our lycanthropic curse, she doesn\u0027t see why we shouldn\u0027t be able to do it too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not powerful enough,\" Dervish tells her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it\u0027s just a matter of knowing the right spells,\" Juni suggests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so,\" he says. \"If that was the case, Bartholomew Garadex would have discovered them. He was dogged in his determination to end the curse but he got nowhere by himself. It takes a demon master to overturn the spell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Dervish insists. \"Bartholomew was the world\u0027s most powerful magician of the last couple of centuries. If he wasn\u0027t able to do it, none of us can. We\u0027d be wasting our time if we went down that avenue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if we tried Lord Loss?\" she asks. \"Maybe you\u0027re wrong about him not accepting the chess challenge again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Dervish laughs shortly. \"That isn\u0027t an option.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if he\u0027s the only one who can turn Grubbs back...\" Juni persists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not an option,\" Dervish says again. Firmly. End of discussion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m enjoying my time alone with Juni. She\u0027s different than when she was merely counselling me. Magic is her thing, what really interests her. She\u0027s more open when we\u0027re talking about spells and demons. She lets her guard down and stops treating me like a patient. Sometimes it seems we talk more about her and magic than we do about me and my problems, but that\u0027s fine. She still sees Bill-E and some of my friends in her professional capacity, but not as much as before. She\u0027s due to finish at our school at the end of the week. Misery\u0027s not returning but he\u0027s being replaced by another counsellor. Juni\u0027s done what she set out to. Time to move on to another job, another challenge. But she\u0027s not thinking about that until after the weekend. First she wants to see what happens to me when the full moon rises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThursday. Testing for magical potential again. In the TV room. Dervish is in the kitchen, keeping out of the way. Juni\u0027s trying something new. Up to this point she\u0027s probed carefully, gently, just scratching the surface. Tonight she wants to go deeper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relax,\" she says, standing behind me as I squat on a stool. \"Clear your mind.\" She puts her hands on my head. \"I\u0027m going to provoke you.\" Her fingers slide to my neck and her nails scratch the flesh there, lightly. \"I\u0027m going to pick and poke at your flesh while I jab magically at you. It will be more irritating that way. I\u0027m hoping something will stir within you in response, drive me out and stop me hurting you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Hurting\u0027?\" I repeat uneasily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry.\" I sense her smile. \"I won\u0027t really hurt you. Trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe massages my shoulders. At first it\u0027s nice but then she digs her thumbs in. Works her way down my arms, pinching, scratching. Nothing too severe. Just irritating, like she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe mutters spells while she works. I feel magic seep into me, a weird sensation beneath my skin. It\u0027s like having a dead leg, only I\u0027m itchy all over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMinutes pass. Juni works. Down my back, my chest, my legs. Very prickly now, twitching and jerking, wishing she\u0027d stop, wondering if I should say something or just grit my teeth and bear it. Finally, when I\u0027m on the point of calling it quits, she releases me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" she says, sounding disappointed. She puts a couple of fingers on my left cheek. \"You can open your eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I blink my eyes open, I catch her looking at me. A strange look. As if she thinks I\u0027m lying and disapproves of me. There\u0027s even a shade of hostility in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was definitely there before,\" I tell her as she takes her fingers away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure it was,\" she says, the suspicious look disappearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it\u0027ll come back tomorrow or the next night. When the moon...\" I nod towards the window, where the curtains keep out the light of the almost full globe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps,\" she says. \"Magic is certainly affected by lunar movements. Most mages experience a surge of extra energy around the time of a full moon. But it\u0027s strange for you not to be showing any signs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sits beside me. Brings a hand up and ruffles my hair. Smiles fondly, then whispers, \"Tell me your secret. The thing you won\u0027t talk to Dervish about. I haven\u0027t asked before and I won\u0027t ask again if you don\u0027t answer. But I think you want to reveal it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMouth dry. Heart beating hard. I wasn\u0027t going to tell her. I meant to keep it secret. But now that she\u0027s asked, I realise she\u0027s right. I want to share it with her. Hell, I\u0027m suddenly longing to spill the beans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He called the Lambs,\" I croak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lambs?\" she frown. \"What have sheep to do with this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Family executioners. The Lambs. When one of us turns... if the parents can\u0027t bear to keep them alive, but can\u0027t kill them by themselves, the Lambs do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah. I remember. The dream in Slawter. Their laboratory.\" Her frown deepens. \"You think Dervish summoned them? That he\u0027s plotting against you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not plotting,\" I mutter. \"But if I turn and he can\u0027t control me, I think he wants them to kill me. He said he was going to ask a magician for help, but he didn\u0027t. He called in the Lambs instead. And that\u0027s... y\u0027know... not fine, but I know why he did it. I just wish he\u0027d waited. Or told me he was summoning them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He hasn\u0027t told you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then how do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI explain about his conversation on the phone, the black folder, the tramp. She asks me to describe the tramp but I can only give her a very general description.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re certain he\u0027s a lamb?\" she asks dubiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He never said?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But he\u0027s been hounding me. I\u0027ve seen him outside this house. And at the cave.\" We\u0027ve told her about the cave, how Loch really died. Dervish took her there to get a sense of it. One magical whiff of the place and she agreed he\u0027d done the right thing, that it needed to be hidden from the world. \"Why would he be following me if he wasn\u0027t one of the Lambs?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There are all sorts of people in the world,\" Juni says. \"Some follow boys for dark-but very human-reasons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" I shift uncomfortably. \"But it\u0027d be an awful coincidence, this tramp taking an interest in me at this precise time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sometimes think the world runs on coincidences.\" Juni pats my hand. \"Don\u0027t worry about the tramp.
