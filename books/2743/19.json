Or call?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, combing his hair back from his forehead with one hand, the other stuffed into the front pocket of his jeans. “I was in the building.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI angled my head. “You were in the building, and thought you’d just stop by and I’d be in my room?” I had planned to just be in my room, but that was beside the point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, of course I didn’t assume you’d be there,” he backpedaled. “I hoped you’d be there.” He looked toward the curb again. “Is… that guy waiting for you, or something?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned then and saw Lucas, arms crossed over his chest, still leaning against his motorcycle. I couldn’t make out his facial features from this distance, even with the flood lights surrounding the dorm. But his body language spoke volumes. I lifted a hand and waved, to let him know I wasn’t being threatened. “No. He was just dropping me off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a smirk of disdain in Lucas’s direction, Kennedy turned his sharp green eyes to me. “He doesn’t look as though he understands the concept of ‘dropping off,’ if you ask me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I didn’t ask you. What do you want, Kennedy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome guy going inside called out, “K-Moore!” and Kennedy acknowledged him with a lifted chin before answering me. “I told you, I want to talk.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crossed my arms, starting to feel the chill in the air I hadn’t felt pressed to Lucas. “About what? Haven’t you said everything that needs to be said? Do you want to devalue me some more? Because I have to tell you, I’m not real super amenable to that.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed as though tolerating some sort of distraught outburst, a familiar consequence of me being inflexible—his word—that I’d seen many times in the past three years. I’d forgotten about that until seeing it again. “There’s no need to be inflexible,” he said then, as though reading my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really? I think there are plenty of reasons for my inflexibility. Or stubbornness. Or obstinacy. Or pigheadedness—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I get it, Jackie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands made fists at my hips. “It’s. Jacqueline.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped closer, his eyes flaring. For a split second, I thought he was angry—but that wasn’t anger in his eyes. It was desire. “I get it, Jacqueline. I hurt you. And I deserve everything you’re saying, and everything you feel.” He raised his hand to my face and I stepped back, out of his reach, my thoughts chaotic. Dropping his hand, he added, “I miss you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 13\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnapping my mouth closed, I spun to swipe my card and enter the dorm, and Kennedy followed me through the door. I turned to tell him I didn’t want to talk and saw Lucas grabbing the door just before it snapped shut. Stepping next to me, he glared at my ex and the air was charged between them the moment Kennedy turned and noticed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You okay, Jacqueline?” Lucas asked, his eyes never wavering from my ex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lucas—” I started to reiterate verbally that Kennedy was no physical threat to me when he huffed an arrogant laugh, peering at Lucas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait—aren’t you the maintenance guy? The one who repaired the A/C at the house?” He glanced at me, and back to Lucas. “What would administration think about you sniffing around the students?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look on Lucas’s face was murderous, but he held his ground without reaction, ignoring Kennedy’s question as though it hadn’t been asked. He turned his eyes to me, waiting for my answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine. I promise.” I held my breath, hoping he’d believe me. People near the door were already nudging each other and whispering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you hooking up with this guy, too?” Kennedy interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Too?” I asked, but I knew what he meant before he confirmed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In addition to Buck.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe edges of my vision closed in. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKennedy took my arm just above the elbow, as though he meant to escort me away, and Lucas’s hand shot out, grabbing his wrist and removing his hand from me easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the fuck?” Kennedy’s voice was a low growl as he jerked his arm from Lucas’s grip. He put himself slightly in front of me, facing off with Lucas, and everyone within sight of the developing spectacle was stock-still and gawking. The two of them looked evenly matched, but I knew Lucas’s proficiency firsthand. Kennedy would lose, and Lucas would be expelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped around my ex and laid a hand on his forearm. It was rock-hard beneath my fingers. “Kennedy, leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not leaving you with this—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kennedy, leave.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s a maintenance man, Jackie—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s a student, Kennedy.” I decided not to point out that Lucas was in our econ class, in case he recognized him as the class tutor and reported him for going out with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKennedy inclined his head, his expression transforming into concern—slightly furrowed brow, eyes searching mine. “We’ll talk next week. When we’re home.” His meaning was clear and directed at Lucas. The two of us were about to spend several days in our hometown, where he would have unrestricted access to me, without the nuisance of interference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to tell him I had nothing to say to him, not now or then, but my jaw was clenched so tightly that I couldn’t speak. Still unsure what I was even doing over Thanksgiving break, I ignored his implication that we would be alone then. Judiciously, he didn’t try to touch me again, though his lethal expression matched Lucas’s as they faced off. I didn’t exhale until he went through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnlooker disappointment was palpable. A few hung around to see if there would be a bonus row between Lucas and me. The adrenaline was clearly still pumping through him—his body was taut, like the hard wire of my bass strings, and when I reached a hand to his forearm, it was granite under layers of leather and flannel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m okay, honest.” I sighed heavily. “Well, as okay as I can be after that.” I squinted up at him. “Exactly how many jobs do you have, anyway? Barista, self-defense guru, fixit guy, parking enforcement officer—and by the way, does that mean you gave me the ticket I got last spring for two measly minutes of double parking when I ran into the library to return a book?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis shoulders relaxed with my teasing tone, and I was rewarded with the ghost smile. “I plead the fifth on that. I write a lot of parking tickets. The, um, fixit thing is rare. And I volunteer time for the self-defense gig.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat I’d left off this list, and what he didn’t add: economics tutor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess we should add one more, huh?” I said, watching him closely. He had a superb poker face. No reaction at all. “Personal defender of Jacqueline Wallace?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe faint smile appeared again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Another volunteer position, Lucas?” I asked coyly, brows rising. “How will you have time for studying? Or anything fun?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands reached for me, gripping my hipbones and pulling me forward. He stared down at me, his voice low. “There are some things I will make time for, Jacqueline.” Leaning, he kissed the spot just in front of my ear, the spot that made my breath go shallow. And then, he turned and jogged out to his motorcycle, leaving me standing in the entryway. Once he was outside the pool of light surrounding the building, I couldn’t see him. I turned and walked to my room in a daze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacqueline,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour paper is good. Solid research. I think Dr. H will be pleased with it. I noted a couple of small inconsistencies, and one place you may have left out a citation. Other than that, I think it’s a valid, well-supported argument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve attached the worksheet for tomorrow’s session. You’re caught up now, and you seem to have a good grasp on the new material, but I’ll continue to send you the worksheets for the last two weeks of class, if you’d like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI assume you’re going home over the break? I’ll be heading home Wednesday morning. No wifi there, so I’ll be out of pocket until Sunday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLM\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLandon,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooks like I may get this paper turned in early—what a relief. Thank you for your help. Yes, please continue to send the worksheets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy parents are going skiing over break, but I’d rather go home for a few days and hang out with old friends than stay here on campus. They’ll be boarding Coco, Mom’s evil-tempered little dog, so it should be peaceful and quiet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you flying home? I remember you saying you were carless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJW\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacqueline,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour parents are going skiing and not taking you? You’ll be at home for Thanksgiving alone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m hitching a ride from someone with a car. Home isn’t far, though it seems like another world at times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLM\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLandon,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy parents thought I’d be at my ex’s. We’ve traded off the last couple of years rather than trying to join both family meals; this was his year. My BFF’s family will be at her grandparents’ cabin outside Boulder, and I’m not in the mood to burden anyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’d rather be alone. That’s weird, huh?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJW\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacqueline,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot weird to me. But maybe I’m just weird, too, and I wouldn’t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll miss your emails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLM\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLandon,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDitto. Have a good break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJW\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t look back at Lucas during class Monday without thinking about Saturday night. His hooded stares made me think he was having the same issue. After I caught him staring holes into the back of Kennedy’s head, I didn’t turn back around. When class ended, Kennedy turned and smiled at me. I forced my lips into a line and turned my back to him to pack up. This class, this semester could not end too soon, for too many reasons to count.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can I just say—your ex is gorgeous, but he seems like a conceited asshat.” Benji crammed his spiral into a backpack that looked as though it could erupt with loose papers any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI zipped my backpack. “Yeah, he totally is.” We waited for Kennedy to pass before moving into the aisle, and I studiously avoided making eye contact. I was more than a little worried about his assertion that we would talk while we were both home; I couldn’t imagine what he could have to say that I’d want to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing our classmates up the steps, everyone animated with anticipation of the coming long weekend, Benji told me he’d be flying home to Georgia and coming out to his father—the only member of his family he hadn’t told. “Mom’s known I was gay since I was thirteen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was worried on his behalf. “Will your dad be… upset?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. “I think he knows. He’s just not sure if that means I’m going to show up in a dress or something.” The thought of Benji in a dress wasn’t a pretty picture, and I couldn’t hold back my laugh. He laughed too, adding, “I know, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucas was gone, or so I thought, until Benji and I emerged into the busy hallway and I spotted him leaning on the far wall, near the side door I usually took to escape the building. He watched us approach, but he seemed acutely aware of everyone else as well. I imagined him watching for Dr. Heller. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/easy-contours-of-the-heart-1/page-19.html","bookId":2743,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:44:59 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:44:59 PM"}
