There was often no sunlight in the World of Dreams, but now it bathed the area around Rand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoridin stumbled back. He looked up at the light, then gazed at Rand and narrowed his eyes. \"Don’t think . . . don’t think I will believe your simple tricks, Lews Therin. Weiramon was shaken by what you did to him, but it’s not such a difficult thing, holding saidin and listening for people’s heartbeats to speed up\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand exerted his will. The crackling dead leaves began to transform at his feet, turning green again, and shoots of grass broke through the leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe green spread from him like spilled paint, and clouds above boiled away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoridin’s eyes opened wider. He stumbled, staring at the sky as the clouds retreated . . . Rand could feel his shock. This was Moridin’s dream-shard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, to draw another in, he had had to place it close to Tel’aran’rhiod. Those rules applied. There was something else, too, something about the connection between the two of them . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand strode forward, lifting his arms out to the sides. Grass sprouted in waves, red blossoms burst from the ground like a blush upon the land. The storm stilled, the dark clouds burned away by light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell your master!\" Rand commanded. \"Tell him this fight is not like the others. Tell him I’ve tired of minions, that I’m finished with his petty movement of pawns. Tell him that I’m coming for HIM!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is wrong\", Moridin said, visibly shaken. \"This isn’t . . \" He looked at Rand for a moment, standing beneath the blazing sun, then vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRand let out a deep breath. The grass died around him, the clouds sprang back, the sunlight faded. Though Moridin was gone, holding on to that transformation of the landscape had been difficult. Rand sagged, panting, recovering from the exertion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere, willing something to be true could make it so. If only things were that simple in the real world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes and sent himself away, to sleep for the short time before he had to rise. Rise, and save the world. If he could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePevara crouched beside Androl in the rainy night. Her cloak was soaked completely through. She knew a couple of weaves that would have been useful for that, but she didn’t dare channel. She and the others would be facing Turned Aes Sedai and women of the Black Ajah. They could sense it if she channeled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They’re definitely guarding the area\", Androl whispered. Ahead of them, the ground broke away into a large sequence of mazelike brickworks and trenches. These were the foundation rooms of what would eventually become the Black Tower proper. If Dobser was right, other rooms had been created within the foundation—hidden chambers, already complete, that would continue to be secret as the Tower itself was constructed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pair of Taim’s Asha’man stood chatting nearby. Though they tried to appear nonchalant, the effect was spoiled by the weather. Who would choose to stand outside on a night like this one? Despite a warm brazier lighting them and a weave of Air to send the rain streaming away, their presence was suspicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuards. Pevara tried sending the thought to Androl directly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt worked. She could feel his surprise as the thought intruded onto his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething returned, fuzzy. We should take advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, she sent back. The next thought was too complex, though, so she whispered it. \"How have you never before noticed that he left the foundation guarded at night? If there really are secret rooms, then the work on them would be done at night as well\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Taim set a curfew\", Androl whispered. \"He lets us ignore it only when convenient to him—such as for Welyn’s return tonight. Besides, this area is dangerous, with those pits and trenches. It would be a good enough reason to set guards, except . . \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Except\", Pevara said, \"Taim isn’t exactly the type to care if a child or two break their necks poking around\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrol nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePevara and Androl waited in the rain, counting their breaths, until three ribbons of fire flew from the night and struck the guards directly in their heads. The two Asha’man dropped like sacks of grain. Nalaam, Emarin and Jonneth had done their work perfectly. Quick channeling; with luck, it either wouldn’t be noticed or would be thought the work of Taim’s men on guard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight, Pevara thought. Androl and the others really are weapons. She hadn’t stopped to consider that Emarin and the others would lead with lethal attacks. It was completely outside her experience as an Aes Sedai. Aes Sedai didn’t even kill false Dragons if they could help it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gentling kills\", Androl said, eyes forward. \"Albeit slowly\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight. Yes, there might be advantages to their bond—but it was also blasted inconvenient. She would have to practice shielding her thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmarin and the others came in from the darkness, joining Pevara and Androl at the brazier. Canler remained behind, with the other Two Rivers lads, ready to lead them from the Black Tower in an escape attempt if something went wrong tonight. It made sense to leave him, despite his protests. He had a family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey dragged the corpses into the shadows, but left the brazier burning. Someone looking for the guards would see that the light was still there, but the night was so misty and rainy one would have to draw close to realize that its attendants had vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough he often complained that he didn’t know why the others followed him, Androl immediately took charge of this group, sending Nalaam and Jonneth to watch at the edge of the foundation. Jonneth carried his bow, unstrung in the wet night. They were hoping the rain would let up, and that he’d be able to use it when they couldn’t risk channeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrol, Pevara and Emarin slid down one of the muddy slopes into the foundation pits that had been dug. Mud splashed over her as she landed, but she was already soaked, and the rain washed away the grime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe foundation was made of stones built up to form walls between rooms and hallways; down here, this became a labyrinth, with a steady stream of rain falling from above. In the morning, the Asha’man soldiers would be set to drying out the foundation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow do we find the entrance? Pevara sent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndrol knelt, a very small globe of light hovering above his hand. Drops of rain passed through the light, looking like tiny meteorites for a moment as they flashed and vanished. He rested fingers in the pooling water on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up, then pointed. \"It runs this way\", he whispered. \"It’s going somewhere. That is where we\u0026amp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-45.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
