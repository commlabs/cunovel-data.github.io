She paced back and forth waiting for Alan Tucker to arrive with the girl. No. Not a girl. A woman. A nun. What would she be like? What had life done to her? What have I done to her?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe butler walked into the room. \"Your guests have arrived, Madam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a deep breath. \"Show them in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA moment later, Megan and Alan Tucker entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s beautiful, Ellen thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTucker smiled. \"Mrs. Scott, this is Megan.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllen looked at him and said quietly, \"I won\u0027t need you anymore.\" And her words had a finality to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile faded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good-bye, Tucker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood there a moment, uncertain, then nodded and left. He could not get over his feeling that he had missed something. Something important. Too late, he thought. Too bloody late.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllen Scott was studying Megan. \"Sit down, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegan took a chair, and the two women sat there inspecting each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looks like her mother, Ellen thought. She\u0027s grown up to be a beautiful woman. She recalled the terrible night of the accident, the storm and the burning plane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou said she was dead...There\u0027s something we can do. The pilot said we were near avila. There should be plenty of tourists there. There\u0027s no reason for anyone to connect the baby with the plane crash...We\u0027ll drop her off at a nice farmhouse outside of town. Someone will adopt her and she\u0027ll grow up to have a lovely life here... You have to choose, Milo. You can either have me, or you can spend the rest of your life working for your brother\u0027s child\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now here was the past confronting her. Where to begin?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m Ellen Scott, president of Scott Industries. Have you heard of it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course she would not have heard of it, Ellen chided herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was going to be more difficult than she had anticipated. She had concocted a story about an old friend of the family who had died, and a promise to take care of his daughter - but from the moment she had first looked at Megan, Ellen knew that it would not work. She had no choice. She had to trust Patricia - Megan - not to destroy them all. She thought of what she had done to the woman seated before her, and her eyes filled with tears. But it\u0027s too late for tears. It\u0027s time to make amends. It\u0027s time to tell the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllen Scott leaned across to Megan and took her hand. \"I have a story to tell you,\" she said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had been three years earlier. For the first year, until she became too ill to continue, Ellen Scott had taken Megan under her wing. Megan had gone to work for Scott Industries, and her aptitude and intelligence had delighted the older woman, giving her a fresh outlook and reinforcing her will to live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll have to work hard,\" Ellen had told her. \"You\u0027ll learn, as I had to learn. In the beginning, it will be difficult, but in the end, it will become your life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegan worked hours that none of her employees could even begin to emulate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You get to your office at four o\u0027clock in the morning and work all day. How do you do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMegan smiled and thought: If I slept until four o\u0027clock in the morning at the convent, Sister Betina would scold me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllen Scott was gone, but Megan had kept learning, and kept watching the company grow. Her company. Ellen had adopted her. \"So we won\u0027t have to explain why you\u0027re a Scott,\" she had said. But there was a note of pride in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s ironic, Megan thought. All those years at the orphanage when no one would adopt me. And now I\u0027m being adopted by my own family. God has a wonderful sense of humor. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sands-of-time/page-40.html","bookId":2361,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:56 AM"}
