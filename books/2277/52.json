Hurry!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dog was ahead of him, barking insanely, as he raced up the stairs. Jude followed two steps at a time and tried to burst into his apartment. The bolts were solid; he’d seen to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwearing, he rushed to his father’s door, burst in and dashed through the splintered door to his own apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dog was ahead. He followed the dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby Walden pressed his full weight into Whitney; she was tearing and ripping at his fingers, struggling desperately against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would happily have shot the man, but the way that they were struggling… Whitney suddenly twisted and blocked his shot. He sheathed the gun and tackled the man who was on top of her, bringing them both off Whitney and rolling across his den floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby Walden knew how to fight, but he didn’t have Jude’s size or strength, nor did he spend his free hours with a punching bag, learning how to burn off frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBobby only got in one good jab; Jude was furious, seeing red, and he pummeled the man. Until he felt Whitney’s fingers, weak, but tugging at his shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jude…no. He’s got to stand trial. He’s got to help us sort through it all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe eased back; his hands were bloody. For a moment, Bobby Walden, wound in the cloak, the mask ripped away, lay on the floor. His face was swollen, his eyes were nearly closed. He was alive—Jude could see him breathing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up, reaching to drag the man to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bobby Walden, you’re under arrest for the murder—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo his amazement, the man suddenly screamed—a piercing, bone-chilling scream that sounded louder than anything Jude had ever heard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ghost dog started barking insanely again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJude twisted around, wondering what could cause such a shriek of pure terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought that he heard the swish of fabric. It seemed that there were shadows and strange forms in the air; he thought he caught a whiff of perfume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No! No! No!” Bobby suddenly screamed. He broke loose from Jude and ripped his clothing and his flesh, bolting through the window to the fire escape. “Ah, hell!” Jude raged, trying to fling himself after the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it seemed that he couldn’t get through the figures, as if the air had become water or rich honey, impossible to penetrate. But it wasn’t the air; it was the women moving after Bobby Walden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe made his way to the window, but Bobby’s back arched against the metal rungs of the fire escape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Jude could reach him, he fell…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t hit the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was caught on the metal rungs of the fire escape, and there were sickening moments in which the man sputtered and choked…until he strangled to death on the heavy rawhide loop he had around his neck. A talisman was attached to the rope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe relic that held the finger bone of Gilles de Rais.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe barking stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room seemed to be freshened by a sudden rush of clean air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJackson Crow and Jake Mallory burst into the room, guns in position, followed by members of the NYPD.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJude came to where Whitney was slumped on the floor and fell down at her side. He took her into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a great deal more to be done by law enforcement at that moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo man was an island. Law enforcement wasn’t one man. There was a task force working this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey could deal with the situation now….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo way he was writing another report tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEpilogue\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhitney had been dosed with a powerful combination of drugs, all available to any good-looking marquee name. Jude was horrified to realize that the man had been using Hannah for information on what was going on with the case. Jude knew he’d have to talk to her, and he sat for long periods of time wondering about people in general. Some of the victims Angus Avery and Bobby Walden had chosen had been hungry for fame and a better life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Hannah had just been hungry for attention from a man who had really seemed to care about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhitney was kept in the hospital overnight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJude stayed by her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had a feeling they would one day discover that Bobby Walden had employed knowledge he’d learned about date-rape drugs earlier. He’d been an up-and-coming star, and those women he had accosted before he had fallen in with Angus Avery—and his particular form of the devil—had probably never reported that he’d raped them, if they’d realized it. Who would have believed them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was good that Ellis was just what he seemed. A good cop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was good that Wally Fullbright was what he seemed, too. An eccentric little man with a keen interest in mysteries and a talent at autopsy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe left Ellis to deal with Angus Avery as they used what they had learned from Bobby Walden to try to piece together exactly what had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvery’s house arrest was revoked. He answered a few questions, and they learned that he was proud of all that he had accomplished. He’d known about Jonathan Black and been fascinated with theories about Jack the Ripper and Black since he’d been a child growing up by the seaport. He’d written the movie years before, and he’d known that he had to re-create the fear of the late 1890s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonathan Black had told him so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey didn’t learn much more about the details of who had done what because Angus Avery strangled himself to death in his cell at Rikers Island with the sheet from his bed. His death surprised everyone; he hadn’t been on suicide watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhitney and Jude knew, of course, that he’d been prompted to his action by a different power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCops were supposed to believe in justice, not vengeance, Jude knew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he’d seen the bodies of their victims on the autopsy tables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn’t feel any sorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was due to receive a commendation that he didn’t feel he deserved. What he did deserve, and what he was taking, was a long vacation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEllis Sayer was one damn good detective, and the world of New York would be just as well served with Ellis holding down the high-profile realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t know when Whitney’s team would be called to another investigation; he just wanted every day with her that he could have. The team wasn’t in a hurry to leave—they still felt there was unfinished business at Blair House.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne night, when he’d spent the afternoon next to Monty at the hospital, he headed over to Blair House in the early evening. Angela was preparing a roast. Jake’s fiancée was joining them at the house while they finished up in New York, and the two were musicians. He’d been invited for a Krewe of Hunters evening, and he was grateful that they considered him part of their in-crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he arrived, he could see through the open gate that Whitney was standing in the front, looking perplexed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s going on?” he asked her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him and smiled sheepishly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“One more time,” she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis heart thudded. “One more time?” he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled and moved against him, lifting her head and coming on her toes to give him a kiss. “One more time with picks and shovels!” she told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe arched a brow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The dog, Jude. I have to find the dog. The excavation team dug up an old metal tag. A dog tag. It had the name Rufus on it. I think—I know you saw Rufus, Jude. I know that you did. I have to find him. We’ve decided that, between us, and with a fund from city donations, we can actually bury the victims from the past—and Jane Doe dry, until we find out who she is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If we find out who she is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We may never,” Whitney agreed. “When we bury Annie Doherty, I want to bury Rufus with her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you said they found his tag next door, at the excavation site.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right. I think Rufus tried to protect his mistress. I believe someone got a hold of him, but he escaped. He came back, and the owners cared for him, never understanding why he sat in the yard, staring at the House of Spiritualism, barking now and then, and trying to get someone to understand. Please, Jude, I know this is hard, but…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s dig,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne by one, the others came out. Jude was silently glad to see that Jake Mallory’s fiancée was a sweet and beautiful young woman. He couldn’t help but see that Ashley and Jake were so close, and he had to admit that he had felt a twinge of jealousy now and then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Ashley dug in with the rest of them, not at all surprised that they were going to search for the remains of a ghost dog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Whitney had thought—though they did tear up the yard and make a mess of it—they found the remains of a dog. They were tenderly gathered, and wrapped, and set in a show box to await burial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a beautiful night; it was the first night he had really relaxed, it seemed, since he’d been called in when the body of Sarah Larson had been pulled from the river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t leave until morning. Whitney, groggy, golden and beautiful, reached out her arms to him when he was ready to go. He paused, returned to her side and kissed her. But she couldn’t coax him back into bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll be back,” he promised her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the animal shelter, the attendant told him that they didn’t have any full-blooded German shepherds at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJude smiled. “I don’t want a full-blooded shepherd. I want a mix. Something big and furry and lovable that enjoys people and needs a good home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, there’s Ruff,” the attendant told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who?” Jude asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ruff—that’s what they called him when he was found on the street, I guess. Anyway, it’s what we’ve been calling him here,” the attendant told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll take Ruff,” Jude said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You haven’t even seen him yet!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know I’m going to like him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he did. Ruff was a mixture of shepherd and something big—maybe a wolfhound, or deerhound. He wagged his tail wildly when he met Jude, whined softly and slipped his wet nose against Jude’s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe filled out all the paperwork, paid the fee and left a donation, and left the shelter with Ruff, a shiny new collar and tags, and a long leash. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sacred-evil-krewe-of-hunters-3/page-52.html","bookId":2277,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:39:15 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:39:15 PM"}
