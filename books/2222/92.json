After word of what Merodie had done leaked out, he was thoroughly chastised in the media for not being able to protect his prisoners. Next, a district court judge rejected his claim on Richard Scott Nye and ordered that he be transferred to the custody of the Hennepin County attorney. It was more or less a technicality anyway, since Nye was in Mercy Hospital at the time having a glass eye inserted into his socket. The prosecutor immediately charged him with second degree murder and first degree criminal sexual conduct, which pretty much removed any remaining incentive Nye might have had to testify in Tuseman’s meth trials. As a result, Tuseman was forced to drop the charges against half the suspects, and of the nine he actually brought to trial, five were acquitted. The TV and newspapers—along with his political opponents—crucified him for his incompetence. True, he wasn’t entirely to blame, but hey, he who lives by the mass media dies by the mass media. Eventually, he was forced to resign as county attorney, and Rollie Briggs took over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for the State Senate, Tuseman was defeated in the primary by a three-to-one margin. The next day, Mr. Muehlenhaus sent me a case of Aberlour ten-year-old single malt, sherry-cask scotch. I would have sent it back except, well, it was Aberlour ten-year-old single malt, sherry-cask scotch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, Richard Scott Nye was sentenced to 366 months in Stillwater State Prison. He might have been hammered for 488 months, but he cut a deal: In exchange for guilty pleas, he was ordered to serve his sentences for murder and rape concurrently. He was never tried for beating Debbie Miller or attempting to shoot me. Such is life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went to see the therapist Jillian DeMarais had set me up with. He was a nice enough guy, but after three sessions I didn’t think we were making much progress, so I stopped going. Besides, the dreams went away after a couple of weeks, just as I had predicted they would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilk St. Ana finished eighth in the ten-meter platform diving competition at the Summer Olympic Games, but you’d think she won the gold by the way the TV cameras followed her around and network announcers gushed over her bright future and stunning good looks. Twice during the competition she waved at the cameras and mouthed, “Hi, Mom.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMerodie Davies probably didn’t notice. At the time, she was doing thirty-four months and a day for second degree assault at the Minnesota Correctional Facility for Women in Shakopee. Cilia did notice, though, sitting in the stands, yet also following the action on a miniature TV. Cameras caught her watching Silk wave her greeting. She cried both times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for me, I was left with a couple of questions. Did Priscilla St. Ana kill her father, her brother, and Brian Becker? Did I help let a stone killer go free? Not knowing the answers bothered me for a long, long time. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-boyfriends-mac-mckenzie-4/page-92.html","bookId":2222,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:57 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:48:57 PM"}
