It\u0027s a joke, right? Besides, as manager of a successful New Orleans haunted-tour company, Nikki doesn\u0027t scare easily. But in the light of day, harsh reality sets in as a police officer informs her that Andy was brutally murdered--at the exact time Nikki swears the distraught woman was in her room. No one believes her except Brent Blackhawk, a paranormal investigator desperately trying to forget his tragic past. Half Irish, half Lakota--and able to communicate with the dead--Brent is used to living in two worlds. But when he realizes the ghost of a slain government agent is also trying to reach out to Nikki, he knows that she, too, must listen to the dead...if she wants to keep living.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/ghost-walk-harrison-investigation-2.jpg","author":"Heather Graham","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-walk-harrison-investigation-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:31 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:25:13 PM"}
