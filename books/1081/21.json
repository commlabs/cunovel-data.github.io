{"id":45026,"no":21,"title":"VII AFTER THE MIRACLE","content":"The blind singers had a meeting in the church of Lucia. Highest up in the choir behind the altar sat thirty old, blind, men on the carved chairs of the Jesuit fathers. They were poor, most of them; most of them had a beggar’s wallet and a crutch beside them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They were all very earnest and solemn; they knew what it meant to be members of that holy band of singers, of that glorious old Academy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Now and then below in the church a subdued noise was audible. The blind men’s guides were sitting there, children, dogs, and old women, waiting. Sometimes the children began to romp with one another and with the dogs, but it was instantly suppressed and silenced.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Those of the blind who were trovatori stood up one after another and spoke new verses.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You people who live on holy Etna,” one of them recited, “men who live on the mountain of wonders, rise up, give your mistress a new glory! She longs for two ribbons to heighten her beauty, two long, narrow bands of steel to fasten her mantle. Give them to your mistress, and she will reward you with riches; she will give gold for steel. Countless are the treasures that she in her might will give them who assist her.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [253]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “A gentle worker of miracles has come among us,” said another. “He stands poor and unnoticed in the bare old church, and his crown is of tin, and his diamonds of glass. ‘Make no sacrifices to me, O ye poor,’ he says; ‘build me no temple, all ye who suffer. I will work for your happiness. If prosperity shines from your houses, I shall shine with precious stones; if want flees from the land, my feet will be clothed in golden shoes embroidered with pearls.’”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As each new verse was recited, it was accepted or rejected. The blind men judged with great severity.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The next day they wandered out over Etna, and sang the railway into the people’s hearts.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After the miracle of Fra Felice’s legacy, people began to give contributions to the railway. Donna Micaela soon had collected about a hundred lire. Then she and Donna Elisa made the journey to Messina to look at the steam-tram that runs between Messina and Pharo. They had no greater ambition; they would be satisfied with a steam-tram.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Why does a railway need to be so expensive?” said Donna Elisa. “It is just an ordinary road, although people do lay down two steel rails on it. It is the engineer and the fine gentlemen who make a railway expensive. Don’t trouble yourself about engineers, Micaela! Let our good road-builders, Giovanni and Carmelo, build your railway.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They carefully inspected the steam-tramway to Pharo and brought back all the knowledge they could. They measured how wide it ought to be between the rails, and Donna Micaela drew on a piece of paper the way the rails ran by one another[254] at the stations. It was not so difficult; they were sure they would come out well.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That day there seemed to be no difficulties. It was as easy to build a station as an ordinary house, they said. Besides, more than two stations were not needed; a little sentry-box was sufficient at most of the stopping-places.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e If they could only avoid forming a company, taking fine gentlemen into their service, and doing things that cost money, their plan of the railway would be realized. It would not cost so much. The ground they could certainly get free. The noble gentlemen who owned the land on Etna would of course understand how much use of the railway they would have, and would let it pass free of charge over their ground.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They did not trouble themselves to stake out the line beforehand. They were going to begin at Diamante and gradually build their way to Catania. They only needed to begin and lay a little piece every day. It was not so difficult.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After that journey they began the attempt to build the road at their own risk. Don Ferrante had not left a large inheritance to Donna Micaela, but one good thing that he had bequeathed her was a long stretch of lava-covered waste land off on Etna. Here Giovanni and Carmelo began to break ground for the new railway.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e When the work began, the builders of the railway possessed only one hundred lire. It was the miracle of the legacy that had filled them with holy frenzy.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What a railway it would be, what a railway!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The blind singers were the share-collectors, the Christ-image gave the concession, and the old shop woman, Donna Elisa, was the engineer.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1787/52034.html","bookId":1081,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 8:08:55 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 8:08:55 AM"}
