And then she slowly reached out, leaning forward as she extended her arm, fingers dangling in the air as though she was trying to touch someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was then that the subtle change came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were shadows in the room, yes. But now those shadows began to flicker, to dance, following the movements of objects or people that could not possibly exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the shadows moved from the wall… .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was there, the way it had been on the film. So far, it hadn’t taken any form, but seemed to be a mass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike birds. Like birds forming some kind of image, their wings flapping as they hovered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waited. There’d be a face. And the face wouldn’t be that of Rose Langley; it would be Sierra Monte’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blinked and the shadows seemed to darken, to cover the walls and the furniture and drip down them, like shadow blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey took another step, and another, still reaching out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, he was afraid for her. He didn’t know what he was seeing, and he certainly didn’t know what she saw. He didn’t want to wake her, but neither could he leave her as she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rose from the bed and stood behind her, wanting to touch her, to draw her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stepped forward, and he followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey moved toward the shadow, and again he waited, expecting the face to appear… .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it didn’t. Kelsey reached the shadow, and she was almost within it. He slid an arm around her shoulders, determined not to let her know that darkness alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo face appeared before him, but in his mind, he heard the plea again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHelp me. Help them. Help her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stepped back, drawing Kelsey with him. There were no birds in the room, but he thought he heard a flutter of wings. As he’d dreamed earlier, the shadow seemed to burst into dozens of shadowy black birds, wings flapping as they disarticulated the shape they’d been, and disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room seemed lighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan stayed next to Kelsey. She looked confused, and her arm dropped to her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was lighter, he realized. Morning was coming, dispelling the last of the darkness as the sun began to rise in the eastern sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shaft of bright light found its way to them. Kelsey turned and blinked and looked at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Logan? Why are you standing there like that?” And then she seemed to notice her own position. “Why am I standing here like this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you see?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In the corner.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned again, still half-asleep and confused. She seemed to wait for him to speak first, and then said, “That corner?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kelsey, you were sleepwalking. Or something,” he told her. “You don’t remember anything? Anything at all?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. Logan, it’s so strange. You know I’ve seen what I assume to be an incident of residual haunting in here. I’ve described it to you as precisely as I can remember. But just now—” She broke off. “I don’t remember. I don’t remember a thing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at her anxiously, but her eyes were so lost, he didn’t want her worrying anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe it’ll come to you,” he said casually. “Anyway, we can try for another hour or so of sleep.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe touched his cheek. “Logan, I’m so sorry I woke you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m awake half the time on my own.” With a broad smile, he swept out an arm. “After you, Marshal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More sleep.” She yawned. “That’ll work for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe walked to the bed and crawled over to the far side. He got in beside her, lying on his back, and she curled against him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce again, he lay awake. The room was bathed with light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe remembered being with Alana one time, remembered her asking, “Why do ghosts only seem to appear at night?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe they like subterfuge,” he’d told her. But then he’d recalled things he’d seen in the light of day, and he thought about Zachary Chase walking the Alamo and the plaza, in both the mornings and the afternoons. He’d said to Alana, “I suppose ghosts are like the rest of us. Some like the daytime hours, others the night. Some are brazen and some are shy. Some don’t want to be seen. And some want you to hear them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That would be the same as people, wouldn’t it?” Alana had mused. “Some know how to ask others for what they need, and some don’t. And will simply go without.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlana was gone. Truly gone. Whether to the heaven of her Christian fathers, or the great hunting plain of the western tribal people, she had passed on. She had said her goodbyes and embraced whatever new world she’d entered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMurder victims often did stay behind. At least until their murderers were apprehended. And if they never were…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hoped that victims like Chelsea Martin and Tara Grissom never had to see what they’d become. He vowed silently that he’d do whatever he needed to find them rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt Kelsey shift beside him again; she’d gone back to sleep. He smiled slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo easy for her…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan had already gone downstairs when Kelsey finished showering and dressing. She was about to strap on her gun, grab her bag and head down after him when she paused. She could remember waking, with the two of them standing in the corner together, and she could remember what he’d told her. She could even remember that she’d been exhausted. And yet despite all that, it had been incredibly easy to go back to sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought of the day she’d come up here after Corey Simmons had run screaming down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was when she’d seen it. Matt Meyer killing Rose Langley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only everything could play out so clearly before her mind’s eye!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held very still and waited, but the spectral image didn’t come again. And yet as she stood there, she felt there’d been a subtle change in the room. It hadn’t just occurred; it had happened since her room was invaded by the film crew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe considered the film Sean had brought them. Had something else come into the room, something that had lain dormant and was now awakened? She didn’t know. She waited for a few minutes, but nothing moved or changed. She’d opened the drapes. There wasn’t even a shadow in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to walk out, then paused again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want to help you,” she said. But although she waited another full minute, nothing happened. Nothing at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went downstairs to find Logan sitting at one of the saloon tables. Ricky had just poured him a cup of coffee and seemed to be expecting her. “Morning, Miss Marshal,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey laughed. “Good morning, Ricky. That makes it sound as if my last name is Marshal, but, hey, you call me whatever you like. Although Kelsey will do just fine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Coffee, Kelsey?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Ricky went off to bring another cup, Logan spoke softly. “He told me it’s quiet this morning because their cowboy guests left early for a preliminary meet out at the stockyards. Apparently, our friend Corey was quiet and a bit grouchy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s not exactly a surprise,” Kelsey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan shrugged. “Sorry. I can’t seem to trust him. Oh, wait. I’m not supposed to trust him. I’m law enforcement.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t get a chance to reply. Sandy came hurrying over to the table, a newspaper clutched in her hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe set it down in front of them and pulled up a chair, saying, “Here’s today’s front page.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJane’s sketches, created from what remained of the faces she’d seen, the skull bones she’d recorded and measured, and her own intuition, stretched across the paper beneath a headline that read Have You Seen These Women?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelsey looked at Sandy. “This is great. We’re trying to identify these women,” she said. “I’m glad the paper’s being good about helping law enforcement.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandy tapped one of the faces. “I knew this girl!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?” Logan asked sharply. “Sandy, who is she?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t tell you her name. She stopped by and asked if I needed any more help. I didn’t, but I thought about her after she left. I began to think maybe she’d been a runaway, and that I might have done something for her. And now…now she’s one of the dead women, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Logan said. “Sandy, can you remember anything about her? When did she come by?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Three months ago, maybe four. I feel dreadful! If I’d done something, she might still be alive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s no reason to feel that way. Try to think back. She didn’t give you a first name?” Kelsey asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Susan, Sally, Sarah…it began with S.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRicky had returned with a cup of coffee for Kelsey. “Sherry,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sherry,” Kelsey repeated, turning her attention from Sandy to him. “Ricky, did you talk to her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, we talked for a while. She seemed at least twenty-one. She was a nice girl, fascinated by the Longhorn, and I swear she knew more about the place than I did. Her last name started with an H.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan gave an encouraging nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Boy, we’re batting a thousand here, aren’t we?” Ricky sighed. “Higgins, Highland, Hilbert—something like that. We were slow at the time. So much so, there were some nights Sandy and I were the only ones working. And we survived because of the local crowd.” Ricky frowned and looked at Sandy. “We were getting a lot of newspaper people in then, Ted Murphy among them. He’s always been a jerk, but he’s a jerk who built up a bar tab and paid it, so we were actually glad to see him. You might want to check with Ted Murphy. I think he sat at the bar with her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSandy sniffed. “Murphy wanted to set up cameras and stuff in Room 207 and see what he could get. Unlike him, I don’t want to sensationalize the place. Of course, other than his bar tab, which he’s always paid, he wants everything for free.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLogan was on his feet. Kelsey swallowed a few sips of her coffee, preparing to leave. But Logan wasn’t ready to go. He pointed at the paper again. “Sandy, Ricky, please take a good long look at all the women on this page. Do you recognize any of the others?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-unseen-krewe-of-hunters-5/page-34.html","bookId":2279,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:41:41 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:41:41 PM"}
