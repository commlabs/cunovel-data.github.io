Hah!","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe old man slowly began to look up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wore green garments, and didn’t seem very impressive at all with his white hair and emaciated frame. He was even a bit hunched over. But after looking up at Bai Xiaochun, he straightened, and his eyes began to shine even more brightly. Suddenly, his facial features began to change, and an expression of anger filled his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs his energy began to build, his hair changed, transforming from white to pitch black!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time he finished looking up, he didn’t look like an old man anymore, but rather, middle-aged!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as his energy soared, the divine sense and cultivation base fluctuations of the Archaean Realm erupted out from him, as well as a unique, holy air!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the man now seemed to be on the same level as the Vile-Emperor or the Saint-Emperor, he was a bit off in terms of his cognitive ability and overall strength. And yet… even a slightly weakened archaean… was still an archaean!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun couldn’t help but shiver in fear. All of a sudden, he felt like he was facing a chaotic, primeval beast, something whose mere gaze caused all of his hair to stand on end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, it was actually an exciting sensation!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to learn from this archaean… and to do so in a safe fashion!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere could be no better and safer sparring partner than this old man!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShouting at the top of his lungs, he powered up as well, his energy rapidly reaching that of the late Celestial Realm. He also drew on his fleshly body power as he prepared to fight. As a result, although his aura couldn’t quite match up to the archaean’s, his overall energy was close!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey looked at each other for moment, causing rumbling sounds to echo out between them. Then, in the blink of an eye, they both blurred into motion, slamming into each other and causing deafening booms to fill the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrightened, Bai Xiaochi quickly performed a double-handed incantation gesture, sealing the entire area off. Then, he backed up to watch, his expression that of concern, but his true feelings anything but that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who gave you the right to bully me, Bai Xiaochun!? Hmmmphh! Did you really think the grand spirit automaton of this fan would be looking out for you? Yeah right! I just want to see you get beat up!” Although he didn’t dare to give voice to such thoughts, his eyes glittered as he observed the fighting from a distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBooms rang out for about seven or eight breaths of time. At that point, blood sprayed out of Bai Xiaochun’s mouth as he staggered backward several hundred meters before finally forcing himself to a stop. As for the archaean, he simply hovered in place, clasping hands and bowing in Bai Xiaochun’s direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Archaeans really are pretty incredible….” Bai Xiaochun murmured, his eyes glittering thoughtfully. “He didn’t even use any big divine abilities, only ordinary magical techniques and fleshly body power. But even that was enough to force me back…. I can only stay in the fight for a few breaths of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My biggest advantage isn’t being in the late Celestial Realm, it’s… having the powers of regeneration from the Undying Live Forever Technique!” As his injuries healed, he charged into battle once again, using all of his fleshly body power and divine abilities to see what he could do against this archaean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiving Mountain Incantation! Cloud Lightning Forefather Transformation!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMountain Shaking Bash! Undying Hex!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroat Crushing Grasp! Live Forever Lamp!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSutra of Former Reincarnation! Sutra of Present Life and Death!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn one interchange after another, he used all of the magics he had learned through the years, with the exception of his Undying Sovereign’s Fist and the Waterswamp Kingdom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks to this constant fighting, Bai Xiaochun’s cultivation base remained in the late Celestial Realm, but his battle prowess advanced by leaps and bounds. He constantly mixed up the way he used his divine abilities and magical techniques. And thanks to his powers of regeneration, he could fight over and over again, and find his own weaknesses and limitations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDays passed in which Bai Xiaochun was completely wrapped up in his training with the archaean slave. At one point, he asked Bai Xiaochi about the fan’s overall trajectory, but unfortunately, didn’t get much solid information. Bai Xiaochun also found time to work on the third level of his Time Immemorial Codex. Unfortunately, that required a lot of time, as well as a peaceful and calm heart. At the moment, he was too worried about Song Junwan, Zhou Zimo and Bruiser, as well as all of the people from the Heavenspan Realm. After some failures with the enlightenment, he focused completely on sparring with the archaean slave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs his battle prowess increased, the archaean slave slowly began to resort to more complex and powerful magical techniques, and also began to draw on more of his fleshly body power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun lost every single time, but was making rapid, almost unbelievable progress. In the beginning, he could only last against the archaean slave’s simplest magical techniques for seven or eight breaths of time. But now, even after the archaean had begun using powerful divine abilities, he could last for longer and longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Bai Xiaochi, despite the fact that he already knew a lot about Bai Xiaochun, he was completely stunned by what was happening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This guy… is pretty awesome!!” Another few months went by, and it reached the point where Bai Xiaochun could fight the archaean slave for the time it takes half an incense stick to burn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was now fully comfortable in the late Celestial Realm, and had reached new understandings of his own magical techniques. Finally, he demanded that the archaean slave fight even harder!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA boom could be heard as Bai Xiaochun was sent tumbling backward a hundred paces. He was gasping for breath as his wounds began to recover, and yet, the battle spirit in his eyes shone brightly.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Use your highest level of battle prowess!” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe archaean’s eyes glittered as he blurred into motion, becoming a wild tempest that caused the entire damaged fan to shudder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartled, Bai Xiaochi strengthened the sealing marks he had put in place. As for Bai Xiaochun, his eyes shone with madness in the face of the destructive tempest of power that was the archaean slave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The time has finally come to see if my Undying Sovereign’s Fist… can shake a trump card ability from an archaean!” Shouting at the top of his lungs, he clenched his hand into a fist, causing cracking sounds to ring out in all directions. A huge wind sprang up, and within his celestial aura… a scrap of sovereign aura appeared!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe archaean slave shivered and braced himself. At the same time, an enormous figure appeared in the air behind Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shadowy emperor looked like he always had, except… for his right arm!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Undying Sovereign’s Fist!” Bai Xiaochun shouted, lunging forward, his fist seemingly wreathed in flames as it struck toward the archaean slave!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the fist shot forward, the shadowy emperor’s sovereign arm seemed to fuse with Bai Xiaochun, making it seem like he was a sovereign unleashing a fist strike!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first time, the archaean slave let out a shout of fear. Not daring to hold anything back, he unleashed all of the energy he could muster, throwing out his hands to cause countless streams of golden light to shoot out from him. The light instantly transformed into a golden face, which howled as it lunged toward Bai Xiaochun’s incoming fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn what was only the shortest of moments, Bai Xiaochun’s Undying Sovereign’s Fist slammed into the archaean slave’s deadliest move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA huge shockwave spread out through the world of the fan face, accompanied by intense rumbling sounds. The entire fan actually trembled. Bai Xiaochi let out a shriek of terror, and did everything he could to force the magical seals he had put in place to hold tight!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, blood oozed out of the corners of the archaean slave’s mouth, and he staggered backward several steps!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun also staggered backward, coughing up blood. A few hundred meters away, he lurched to a halt, his eyes shining with excitement and delight!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can hurt an archaean!!” At this point, he threw his head back and laughed uproariously. His fist strike truly could hurt an archaean. Although he had ended up hurt in the process as well, with the powers of regeneration of his Undying Live Forever Technique, that was something he could deal with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, in this case, if I use my Archaean Luminescence… then what reason do I have to worry about the Vile-Emperor!?!?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1198\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1200\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1199","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:11 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:11 AM"}
