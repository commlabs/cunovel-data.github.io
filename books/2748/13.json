Which meant that unless we wanted to impress him with our unusual physical abilities even more, we were probably going to have to wait him out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust when I thought things couldn\u0027t get worse, he looked right at Macey. \"How much do you weigh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" I blurted, stepping between them. \"It was nothing. Really! It was like those women who lift trucks off their babies—that\u0027s how I felt.\" I tried to sound like that moment was as exciting and adrenaline-filled and foreign to me as it had been for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Macey added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But the moves…\" he started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mom made me take a self-defense class,\" I blurted. (Totally not a lie.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow.\" He nodded. \"Hope you got extra credit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did,\" I said. (Also not a lie.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well …\" Preston ran his hand through his hair and straightened his tie. \"They must be teaching you something special in that school of yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacey and I looked at each other as if we knew we could kill him, but getting away might be way more difficult than usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we breathed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he looked at both of us with (if he hadn\u0027t been a politician\u0027s son and all) an expression of genuine gratitude as he said, \"I\u0027m just glad I get to do this with girls like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Winters!\" one of the agents called. \"We\u0027re moving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA team of agents surrounded him, ushering Preston away, but Macey lingered a second longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he seemed…nice ?\" I finally found the strength to mutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Macey merely looked at me. \"You\u0027re a spy, Cam. Don\u0027t you know that nothing is ever as it seems?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t get to mention Zach. I didn\u0027t get to tell her what I thought of her speech. I didn\u0027t even get to ask Aunt Abby if she was really serious about telling my mom that I\u0027d been caught out-of-bounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead I watched the Secret Service swarm around my roommate once again. A gate swung open and Macey stepped toward her parents. Her father reached out for her hand, but she was already waving, pulling in votes and smiles and handshakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was already a voice in my earpiece telling me it was time to go home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Fourteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you know how long it took to get back to school? One hundred and seventy-two minutes. Do you know how long it took for things to return to normal? Well… I guess I\u0027m still kind of waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as we got back, Mr. Solomon dragged us all the way down to Sublevel Two to review surveillance tapes and take a pop quiz. (I scored a 98%.) By the time we got upstairs to the foyer I heard the scraping of forks and the clanking of ice in our second-best crystal, but I totally wasn\u0027t hungry, especially when I saw Macey walking through the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Macey!\" I yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cam.\" Bex and Liz ran behind me. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a normal night at a very abnormal school. But even by Gallagher Academy standards I\u0027d had a very exceptional day, so I raced through the entry hall and climbed the stairs, still calling, \"Macey!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time I caught up to her she had already taken off her jacket and was standing there in a silk blouse. She was carrying a string of pearls and had crammed the scarf she\u0027d been wearing at the rally into her purse. With every step, Macey was shedding her fake façade—her cover—one piece of pocket litter at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re back,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" she said in the tone of the incredibly tired, \"very observant. Hey, what was up with you today?\" She took another step, then shed another piece of the clothing that only a mother can love. \"When I saw you, you looked kind of…freaked?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" Bex said, \"you saw her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, I was going to tell you, but well … we haven\u0027t exactly had a moment…And it\u0027s not exactly something you…And I just didn\u0027t know how…And—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cammie.\" Bex snapped me out of it. She crossed her arms, stared me down, and gave me that \"you\u0027ve got some explaining to do\" look that I\u0027ve come to love. And fear. (Well, mostly fear.) And I knew I couldn\u0027t keep my secret any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw something!\" I blurted. Then I had to correct myself as I said, \"Someone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe halls were quiet around us. Dark. The days were getting shorter. Summer was finally gone. And maybe that was why I shivered as I said, \"Zach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime it took me to tell the whole story: twenty-two minutes and forty-seven seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTime it would have taken me to tell the story had I not been constantly interrupted: two minutes and forty-six seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumber of times Liz said, \"No way!\": thirty-three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumber of times Bex gave me her \"You could have brought me with you\" look: nine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what was he doing there?\" Liz was asking again (time number seven, to be exact).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" I managed to mutter. \"I mean, one minute I\u0027m thinking he\u0027s breaching security—well, technically, he did breach security …\" I trailed off. \"And the next I\u0027m flipping him to the ground and—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Staring deeply into his eyes?\" Liz guessed, because while security breaches might be serious, eye-staring-into is something that should never be ignored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe Blackthorne was there for an assignment too?\" Bex asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe,\" I said, but my heart wasn\u0027t in it. I thought about his cryptic postcard—his warning—and the way he\u0027d looked at me that day. \"It\u0027s just that something about him seemed…different.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Bex said. I could feel her moving toward me. Like a tiger. She was lethal and beautiful and very, very catlike in the curiosity department. \"What are you thinking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t know what was more concerning—that there had been a gap, however small, in Macey\u0027s security perimeter, or that Zach had slipped through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about the boy who had kissed me last spring and the one who had looked at me under the bleachers. \"He seemed\"—I started slowly, still trying to put the pieces together—\"worried.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ooh!\" Liz squealed. \"He wants to protect you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need protecting,\" I told her, but Liz only shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the thought that counts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, there is another option,\" Bex said, with a very mischievous grin. \"Maybe he went under the bleachers knowing you wouldn\u0027t be able to resist following him under the bleachers…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let her voice trail off as she stared at me, the possibilities lingering until Liz felt the need to blurt: \"So you could be alone!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, I don\u0027t want to sound braggy. Or unprofessional. Or naïve. But is it wrong to admit that I\u0027d been kind of hoping all day that was the reason? (Partly because, as a girl, that\u0027s a good reason, and as a spy, it meant he wasn\u0027t conspiring to commit high treason.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I blurted. \"No. That can\u0027t be possible. He wouldn\u0027t leave school and go all the way to Cleveland and sneak into a restricted area and everything just to see…me.\" I turned to Macey, our resident expert on all things boy. \"Would he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t look at me,\" Macey said, waving her hands (which were, by that time, holding a pump, a jacket, and a \"walk the walk\" campaign button). \"I have a whole other kind of boy problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait. MACEY McHENRY HAD A BOY PROBLEM? I couldn\u0027t be sure I\u0027d heard correctly, and evidently I wasn\u0027t alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boy\"—Liz stammered—\"problem. YOU?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMacey rolled her eyes. \"Not that kind of problem. Preston.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" Liz said, sounding way too matchmakery, if you want to know the truth. \"He is kind of cute. And really socially aware. You know, I read this article in—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s a dork,\" Macey said, cutting her off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you have so much in common,\" Liz protested. Macey glared. \"I mean, besides the dork thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Common\u0027 is overrated,\" Macey said with another sigh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well then,\" Liz said, \"what\u0027s the problem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The problem is that we were attacked by three highly trained operatives and lived to tell the tale,\" I said without even realizing that I\u0027d known the answer all along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bingo,\" Macey said. \"And Preston was impressed. Very impressed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So boys really do make passes at girls who kick—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bex!\" I cut my best friend off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan I just say that it\u0027s really pretty hard to deal with boys who may want to…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA. Date you, or\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eB. Kill you, or\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eC. Learn the origins of your freaklike self-defense capabilities!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that day it was highly possible that we might have been dealing with ALL THREE!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill the boy drama in my life ever go away?! Seriously. I\u0027m asking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even after you left, he wouldn\u0027t shut up about it,\" Macey told me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could have shut him up,\" Bex suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t think I wasn\u0027t tempted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA group of eighth graders passed by, singing at the top of their lungs, but the four of us stayed quiet and still inside the dark alcove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re smiling,\" Macey blurted, no doubt accusing Bex of doing something Bexish. \"Why are you smiling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" Bex said with a shake of her head. \"I just keep thinking…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBex isn\u0027t one for trailing off. She always knows what comes next and never starts what she can\u0027t finish. So maybe it was that fact, or the way the smile faded from her face, but something made me hold my breath as she found the words to say, \"I just keep thinking how shocked they must have been. You know…them. They thought they were coming after a girl. But instead they got…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gallagher Girls,\" Liz finished for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of them smiled at each other. But Macey and I—we just stared through the shadows, a new realization dawning on both of us as I said, \"But they weren\u0027t surprised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Fifteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve told the story here; I don\u0027t want to tell it again. This is my official record—hopefully the last time I\u0027ll have to answer the question, \"So what happened last summer in Boston?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ve told it now so many times that it comes out automatically, like a textbook I\u0027ve memorized, like a song stuck in my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut after that…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that the story changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe facts were still the same—I\u0027d remembered them correctly all along. But I understood something else then. When the film played in my mind I didn\u0027t focus on the hits or the kicks. That night I saw the eyes, the way arms were ready to parry our punches. The way no one seemed shocked as Macey performed a textbook Malinowski Maneuver on a guy twice her size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA spy is only as good as her cover—as her legend. The\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebad guys weren\u0027t supposed to know the truth about us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure,\" Bex asked me. Again. We huddled together in the nearest, quietest, safest place I could find, surrounded by the remnants of the first-ever covert carrier pigeon breeding program. Liz sat on an overturned pigeon coop. A soft wind blew through the open gaps in the wall, which looked out into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoseville was just two miles away. And Josh. And normalcy. But somehow my first boyfriend and his perfectly ordinary life seemed like a different world entirely as I looked at Bex and then at Liz and, finally, at Macey. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/don-t-judge-a-girl-by-her-cover-gallagher-girls-3/page-13.html","bookId":2748,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:16 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:16 PM"}
