Max held discussions with the computer at the Anagrafe Building, where vital statistics and city-administration data were kept, and he visited the computers at SID, and went to call on the bank computers. They all welcomed Max.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTell me about Ivo Palazzi, Max said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHappily, they replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe conversations began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA grocery bill from Amici...a beauty salon bill from Sergio in the Via Condoitti...one blue suit from Angelo...flowers from Carducci...two evening dresses from Irene Galitzine...shoes from Gucci...a Pucci purse...utility bills...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax kept reading the print-outs, examining, analyzing, smelling. Something smelled wrong. There were tuition fees for six children.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave you made an error? Max asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSorry. What type of error?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe computers at Anagrafe told me that Ivo Palazzi is registered as the father of three children. Do you verify six tuition fees?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou show Ivo Palazzi\u0027s address as being in Olgiata?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is correct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he is paying for an apartment in Via Monte-mignaio?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre there two Ivo Palazzis?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. One man. Two families. Three daughters by his wife. Three sons by Donatella Spolini.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Max was through, he knew the tastes of Ivo\u0027s mistress, her age, the name of her hairdresser, and the names of Ivo\u0027s illegitimate children. He knew that Simonetta was a blonde, and Donatella a brunette. He knew what size dresses and bras and shoes each wore and how much they cost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmong the expenses several interesting items caught Max\u0027s eye. The amounts were small, but they stood out like beacons. There was a receipted check for a lathe, a plane and a saw. Ivo Palazzi liked to work with his hands. Max thought about the fact that an architect would probably know something about elevators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvo Palazzi applied for a large bank loan recently, the computers informed Max.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid he receive it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. The bank asked him to have his wife cosign. He withdrew the request.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax took a bus to the Polizia Scientifica center at EUR, where the giant computer was kept in a large round room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDoes Ivo Palazzi have a criminal record? Max asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAffirmative. Ivo Palazzi was convicted on an as-sault-and-battery charge at age twenty-three. His victim went to the hospital. Palazzi went to jail for two months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnything else?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvo Palazzi keeps a mistress at Via Montemignaio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you. I know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are several police reports of complaints from neighbors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat sort of complaints?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisturbing the peace. Fighting, yelling. One night she smashed all the dishes. Is that important?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVery, Max said. Thank you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Ivo Palazzi had a temper. And Donatella Spolini had a temper. Had something happened between her and Ivo? Was she threatening to expose him? Was that why he had suddenly gone to the bank for a large loan? How far would a man like Ivo Palazzi go to protect his marriage, his family, his way of life?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was one final item that caught the little detective\u0027s attention. A large payment had been made to Ivo Palazzi by the financial section of the Italian security police. It was a reward, a percentage of the money found on the banker whom Ivo had turned in. If Ivo Palazzi was that desperate for money, what else would he do for it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMax bade farewell to his computers and caught a noon flight to Paris on Air France. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodline/page-40.html","bookId":2356,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:05:13 AM"}
