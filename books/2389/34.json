That was an understatement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman went on to say that Emily would have a love affair but never marry and that she’d live a long, happy life. Emily kept waiting for some sort of reference to Jordan, but the woman didn’t mention her. After about five minutes of kneading, she patted Emily’s hand. “There you go. Go forth and be happy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily cocked her head. “So . . . you don’t have anything else to tell me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman frowned. “No, that’s all.” She pulled out a rubber stamp from under the table, pressed it on an ink pad, and stamped Emily’s hand. “It marks that you’ve been here already. I don’t do repeats.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily stood, unable to hide the disappointment on her face. This challenge suddenly felt like the I Spy books she used to look at in the school library. She would drive herself crazy trying to find the hidden snowman or tiny lamb charm or pink apostrophe in the cluttered photos, feeling unobservant and unintelligent when she failed. Or maybe Jordan just didn’t know her that well. Maybe Emily didn’t know Jordan that well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe trudged over to Iris, who was marching in the conga line. Iris let Emily cut in, then looked at her strangely. “What’s on your hand?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily peered at the stamp the fortune-teller had given her. “No repeats,” she mumbled. But when the strobe light flashed on it, she noticed the stamp was a large black circle with the initials JR in the center. She stopped short. Could that stand for Jordan Richards?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe broke out of the conga line, held her hand directly under a recessed light by the buffet, and squinted hard. The mark looked like a stamp on an envelope. Around the initials was the word Bonaire. Could that be some kind of clue as to where Jordan was? Was Bonaire a post office? A town?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily darted out of the ballroom and into the hall, where the light was much brighter, and fished out her old cell phone. The clock at the top said ten PM exactly. Luckily, the WiFi signal in the hotel was strong, so when she typed BONAIRE into the browser, quite a few results immediately popped up. Bonaire was a little island in the Caribbean. Emily clicked on a Chamber of Commerce page. According to the site, Bonaire was a popular spot for snorkeling. The site showed a slideshow of images: tropical fish, people playing in a turquoise ocean. Then, a photo of an old-timey movie theater flashed on the screen. On the marquee, instead of the coming attractions, were the words I MISS YOU, EMILY.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily’s heart almost stopped. She stared, unblinking, at the website, worried she was seeing things. But then the image appeared on the slideshow again. I MISS YOU, EMILY. She gasped. “I miss you, too, Jordan,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe watched it scroll through six more times. Then, at 10:01, it disappeared. Emily felt dizzy. It was the most romantic thing anyone had ever done for her. If only she could book a flight to the Caribbean tonight and find Jordan. But she was sure Jordan was much too smart for that. Even if she had been in Bonaire, she was most likely long gone by now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There you are, Miss Fields!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cold, slender hand landed on her bare shoulder. Emily jumped and looked up. Agent Fuji’s smile was unfriendly. Her conservative gray suit looked out of place among all the tulle and silk. “Have you been avoiding me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily’s mouth immediately felt dry. “Um . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wanted to give you a chance to explain something,” Fuji cut in. “Maybe we could talk right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily’s mouth fell open. Explain . . . what?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout waiting for Emily’s consent, Fuji guided Emily to the end of the hall, where it was quieter. “I received an anonymous tip that you are harboring priceless art in your house,” she said sternly. She leaned closer. “Do I need to get a search warrant, Miss Fields?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarboring priceless art? “There’s no art at my house!” Emily blurted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuji raised an eyebrow. “Is it in someone else’s house you know? I was told one of you girls had something we should know about. If it’s not you, who is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music pounded in Emily’s ears. She’d spoken before thinking. A had told . . . but A hadn’t told everything. It was a brilliant scheme: She was relying on Emily to spill the rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Fuji again. “I-I don’t know what you’re talking about.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh really?” Fuji placed her hands on her hips. “Are you sure about that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily shook her head faintly, trying her hardest to stand her ground. After a moment, Fuji pulled at the strap of her briefcase and spun on her heel. “You better not be lying,” she warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe strode away, her phone glued to her ear before she’d even left the building. Emily felt hot, then cold. What had she just done? Where was Fuji going? As soon as the cops found that painting, they were done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe ran back into the ballroom and looked around for her friends, but she didn’t see any of them anywhere. Her burner phone was at the bottom of her clutch; she whipped it out and dialed Aria’s number. “Not it!” she screamed after the voicemail beep. She tried Spencer next, then Hanna. Nothing. “Not it, not it!” she yelled at both of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIris was behind her, breathless from the conga line. Emily dropped her phone back into her clutch, feeling scattered. “Um . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you get your surprise? You ran out of here so quickly, and . . .” Iris trailed off abruptly, her eyes widening at something across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?” Emily followed her gaze. Was Fuji back? Was there a SWAT team here? The only people on the dance floor were kids in gowns and tuxes. The DJ was now heading the conga line, bopping his head back and forth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIris started to tremble. “I can’t believe it. That’s the guy who visited Ali at The Preserve.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily frowned at the DJ. He had a scruffy goatee, beady eyes, and a fireplug of a body. “Really?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIris nodded, her gaze fixed. “I would recognize his picture anywhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, Emily realized she was looking at a picture on the easel. ROSEWOOD DAY MAY DAY PROM KING AND QUEEN! read swirly lettering at the top. Beneath it was the picture of the king and queen in their crowns. This year’s king and queen. A king Emily knew very, very well. Her gaze fell to the gold watch on his wrist. It was the same gold watch she’d seen in that photo from Tripp’s house. The one that had been taken of Ali at The Preserve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared at Iris, all feeling leaving her extremities. “Noel Kahn? Are you sure?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIris nodded gravely and with authority. “I’d bet my life on it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e29\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore It’s Too Late\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took Spencer forty-five minutes, several hiding spots to avoid the dicey-looking locals, and a fifteen-block walk in the direction of the city before she found a cab that would take her to the Four Seasons. She’d brought some emergency cash and her credit card—A hadn’t found a way to shut that down. She’d tried to power on her phone again and again during the ride, but it was useless. A had jammed her in-box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething hit her, too: A knew of her in-box. Which meant A knew this phone number. Of course A did: A was Chase. He’d probably peeked at her phone when she was hanging out with him. She’d stepped right into his trap, and her friends were going to die because of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced out the window as the Art Museum swept past. Couldn’t the driver get to the hotel any faster? She needed to find Aria, Hanna, and Emily before Chase found them first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, the Four Seasons appeared on the right. “This is fine!” Spencer shouted on the corner, shoving some money at the driver and launching out of the backseat. She ran haltingly down the block in her narrow-fitting maxi gown. Several cabs and limos were parked at the hotel entrance. A familiar black car screamed past Spencer, lifting the ends of her dress. Was that . . . Fuji?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer peered into the tinted windows but couldn’t see the driver or any passengers. Were Hanna, Emily, and Aria already in there? Had Fuji already gotten them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe barreled into the Four Seasons lobby and then into the ballroom. The first person she spied was Reeve Donahue, one of the girls on the decorations committee. “Have you seen Aria Montgomery?” she asked breathlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReeve looked Spencer up and down, curling her lip at Spencer’s torn hem and mussed hair. “That girl has been AWOL all night. She so didn’t deserve to be decor chairwoman.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer eked out a thank you, then did another round of the dance-floor perimeter. Naomi Zeigler was dancing with Henry Bennett. Sean Ackard and Kate Randall were whispering at a private table in the corner. Iris had her head on James Freed’s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer was about to run to Iris and ask her where Emily was when Emily herself appeared in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh my God,” Emily said, grabbing Spencer’s forearms. “Where have you been? And what happened to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a long story,” Spencer said. “But I have something to tell you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ali’s boyfriend was most definitely Noel,” Emily blurted out at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer backed up and looked at her. “Wait, what? Are you sure?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily nodded. “Iris made the connection that Noel visited Ali nonstop at The Preserve.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strobe light flickered across Spencer’s arms as she canvassed the ballroom. If Noel was Ali’s boyfriend . . . then Chase wasn’t. She’d been wrong. She squirmed uncomfortably, not sure if she should feel horribly embarrassed . . . or relieved . . . or still annoyed that Chase knew about Jamaica another way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where is Noel now?” she asked absently. “And Aria? And Hanna?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m here,” Hanna said behind them, rushing into the room as breathlessly as Spencer had a moment before. Her face was drawn, and her hands were shaking. “We came back as fast as we could.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Back from where?” Emily asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Bill Beach.” Hanna’s voice swooped up and down. “Graham woke up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you took Mike?” Spencer was horrified. She peered around the room again. “Where is he now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s . . . somewhere.” Hanna looked around, too, then shrugged. “I didn’t tell Mike what was going on. And he stayed in the car—he didn’t see anything. But guys, Graham saw A. That’s what he wanted to tell Aria.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was it Noel?” Spencer demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna nodded. “Well, all he said was N . . . . I’m sure he meant Noel. But then I had to get the nurse, and when I came back, he was gone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily stepped back. “Gone, as in died?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Jesus,” Spencer whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmily looked at Spencer. “What did you have to tell me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer’s stomach clenched, her mind on Chase again. “Uh, nothing.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Guys, we have to go to the cops with all of this,” Hanna said, peering around the room. “Noel might have a spy at the Bill Beach. He could know we’re on to him. We’ve got to go to the police now and tell them everything we know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We need to go to the police for another reason,” Emily said. “Fuji knows that one of us has the painting . . . but she doesn’t know who. She thought I was hiding it—she asked if there was any reason they should search my house.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crushed-pretty-little-liars-13/page-34.html","bookId":2389,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:24:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:24:21 AM"}
