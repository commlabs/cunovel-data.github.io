{"id":24837,"no":1,"title":"PREFACE.","content":"When it was decided to publish a new and cheaper edition of Mr. George Hooper’s “Sedan,” the question arose whether anything should be added to it. My father had intended, should a new edition be called for, to revise and correct the work, and to furnish it with an index. After due consideration it has been decided to make no additions to the book, except the index, which has been carefully compiled. A few errors that had crept into the text of the original edition have been corrected; but in other respects the volume remains as it was left by its author.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e WYNNARD HOOPER.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e SOUTH KENSINGTON,\n\u003cbr\u003e October, 1897.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1810/52613.html","bookId":1046,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 3:44:37 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 3:44:37 PM"}
