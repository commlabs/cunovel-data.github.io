I would surely detest being a commuter this evening, Conan Doyle thought, walking with his entourage toward the scene of the crime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay in my general vicinity,\" he instructed, \"the spell loses its potency the farther you wander away from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey approached the building, observing a sports utility vehicle, its rooftop obviously crushed by something falling on it, being hoisted up onto the back of a tow truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I bet whatever did that,\" Squire said pointing to the vehicle, \"came from there.\" He craned his neck to look up at the shattered third story window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Man, can\u0027t pull the wool over your eyes, can they?\" Eve said, walking away from them toward a coroner\u0027s van parked on the other side of the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to stay with . . .\" Conan Doyle began, but realized his pleas were falling upon deaf ears. Instead, they all followed the vampiress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you smell it?\" she asked, hopping up into the back of the vehicle, crouching slightly as she unzipped the body bag to take a look at the contents. \"I\u0027d say this was our skydiver.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCeridwen brought a delicate hand to her face. \"The remains stink of demonic magics,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bingo.\" Eve wrinkled her nose in distaste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConan Doyle climbed into the back of the van with Eve, examining the body. \"It was certainly the fall that resulted in this unfortunate woman\u0027s death,\" he observed. \"But it was dark magic that took her there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I say we check out the dead broad\u0027s digs, before any evidence is removed,\" the hobgoblin said, hiking up his pants and adjusting the rim of his baseball cap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An excellent idea, Squire,\" Conan Doyle said, stepping from the van.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they said watching reruns of CSI was a waste of time,\" Squire muttered as they returned to the apartment building across the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDetectives and uniformed police officers were still milling about as they entered the building, went up the stairs, and into the apartment. A crime scene photographer was taking pictures of a headless corpse lying upon the kitchen floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonder where the head is?\" Squire mused aloud, bending down to look under the kitchen table and chairs as Doyle studied the spray of blood on the ceiling above them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCeridwen stood by a withered houseplant in the corner of the living room, her hands gently caressing the yellowed leaves back to full vigor. \"There was a demon here,\" she said. \"The proximity to the foul beast nearly killed her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConan Doyle squatted down on his haunches, examining an identification tag hanging from the belt loop of the corpse\u0027s trousers. \"LeeAnne Fogg,\" he read. \"She was a registered nurse.\" He rose, his knees popping uncomfortably. The wear and tear of the passing years was sneaking up on him yet again, and he made a mental note to partake of some of Faerie\u0027s recuperative elixirs once things had calmed a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" Eve called, motioning for them to follow her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe police officers in the room moved from their path, gently pushed aside by the Conan Doyle\u0027s sorcery, still unaware of their presence. He, Squire, and Ceridwen followed Eve down a short corridor and into a room now frigid with cold from the broken window. Conan Doyle noticed that a blanket had been placed over the open window, likely to protect any physical evidence from being blown away. Two lab techs finished up whatever it was they were doing, the sudden desire to leave incited by Conan Doyle\u0027s spell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here\u0027s the point of departure,\" Eve said standing in front of the billowing blanket, but Conan Doyle\u0027s gaze was fixed upon the large bed positioned in the center of the room. Piles of ash lay on the sheets in the shape of a human body, the bedclothes untouched, though it had taken incredible heat to immolate the victim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what do you think?\" Squire asked, eating from a bag of corn chips. \"Spontaneous human combustion, or what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConan Doyle shook his head as he reached out, allowing his fingertips to sink into the ashen remains. Closing his eyes, he concentrated, reading the traces of dark magicks left behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like a sample of this,\" he said, turning to Ceridwen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" Squire said, shaking out the last of the corn chips from the bag and dropping them into his mouth. \"You can put them in here,\" he explained, wiping his greasy fingers on the front of his clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027d you get those?\" Eve asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I found\u0027em in the kitchen - got a problem with that?\" he asked defensively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scavenger,\" she snarled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquire brandished his stubby middle finger then turned to offer Conan Doyle the corn chip bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe politely refused, again turning to Ceridwen. \"If you would be so kind, my dear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elemental sorceress waved her hand, her movements like the first gestures of a graceful dance. A bubble of air solidified in the path of her hand, and she directed it down to the burned remains where it engulfed a few ounces the ash, lifting it into the air to float before his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, love,\" he said, taking the solidified bubble and placing it in his jacket pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s your handle on this, boss?\" Squire asked. \"From what I seen here, this ain\u0027t your run-of-the-mill demonic manifestation. This prick\u0027s got balls - big ones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEve strolled around the room, her predator\u0027s eye looking for anything that could be of use. \"We were talking before about rules. There are rules against demons this powerful being able to cross over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re correct,\" Conan Doyle said. \"The dimensions are not meant to be porous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCeridwen wrapped her arms about herself as if cold, but Conan Doyle understood it was much more than that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fabric of things seems to be unraveling since the Nimble Man and the release of Sanguedolce,\" Fey sorceress said. \"Perhaps the demons have begun to think that the human world doesn\u0027t have its protectors any longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A disturbing thought,\" Conan Doyle said as he moved toward the door. \"If you\u0027re correct, then we will have to remind the denizens of the dark realms that protectors still exist. And I suggest we use our current demonic invader as an example.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like the way you think, boss,\" Squire said. \"Time to open up a big ol\u0027 can of whupass. \u0027Course, I\u0027ll mostly just be opening the can. I prefer to let the rest of you do the whupassing . . . ass-whupping. Whatever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Candy ass,\" Eve said. \"What a coward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquire grinned. \"I\u0027m a delicate flower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCeridwen furrowed her brow, her perfect, cold beauty almost alien in the shadowed hallway. \"Squire, I will never claim to understand you. I have seen you in combat. You can be quite formidable when you choose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hobgoblin shrugged. \"What can I say? I\u0027m a lover, not a fighter. I\u0027d much rather watch Eve getting all dirty and bloody, fighting in clingy outfits, than do it myself. If I could do that, and have beer and pizza at the same time . . . that\u0027d be Heaven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConan Doyle sighed and tuned them out, unable to listen even a moment longer. He knew that when circumstances turned dire, there were no better allies in the world, no greater hope for humanity than his Menagerie. But sometimes that idea frightened him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey descended the stairs to the lobby, exiting the building in the November cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What now?\" Eve asked, pulling the collar of her stylish cranberry colored leather jacket up against her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConan Doyle removed his gloves from his coat pocket and slipped them over his hands. \"Ceridwen and I will return home to further analyze this sample of remains. Something tells me there is more to be learned here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And us?\" Squire asked, his eyes shifting toward Eve standing beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You two will find its scent,\" he said, placing his arm around Ceridwen\u0027s waist and directing her toward Charles Street. \"And hunt it down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that all?\" Squire asked sarcastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConan Doyle thought for a moment. \"Teach it a lesson,\" he said, walking away. \"Show it that humanity is far from being unprotected.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere the hell are they going now? Danny wondered. He was perched on the rooftop, watching his friends go their separate ways. They were supposedly checking out some scene of potential demonic activity, and if that wasn\u0027t something that could take his mind off his troubles, nothing would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe considered leaping across to the building, checking out things on his own, but thought better of it. All he\u0027d need is some cop to see him, and then the shit would really hit the fan. All he needed was to give Conan Doyle another reason to be pissed at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slumped down to the roof, closing his eyes, letting the cold night air wash over him. He was thinking about his mom, the look on her face after he\u0027d hit her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid I really want to hurt her? he wondered, a twinge of fear causing the strange growth on his chest to tingle. He scratched at himself. He\u0027d just been angry. He could never really hurt his mother.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr could he?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a brief instant, he imagined his teeth sinking into the flesh of her throat, her warm, salty blood exploding into his eagerly waiting mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit!\" Danny said aloud, scrambling to his feet. He wanted to scrub his brain of the imagery. What the fuck is wrong with me?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe decided to return to Louisburg Square and take whatever penance Mr. Doyle could dish out. Then he would tell the man what had been happening, and how much it scared him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut another image flashed through his mind. He saw himself chained in the basement of the Beacon Hill home, a dirty mattress on the floor, a metal pan of water nearby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat irrational rage surged up inside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobody\u0027s going to lock me up like a dog, he thought, baring his fangs in a snarl. I\u0027d just like to see them try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Such anger,\" said a voice from the shadows, and Danny spun toward it, ready for anything. He hoped for a fight - he was itching to spill some blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy who emerged from the shadows was big, and he stank of rancid meat, but he wasn\u0027t the kind of threat Danny was hoping for. He immediately pulled back on his rage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t do that on my account,\" the man said extending his hand. His fingertips were bloody, squared off, missing. \"I was nearly two blocks away when I sensed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy was smiling now, and Danny noticed the rips in the flesh of his jowly face. For a moment, he could have sworn he saw another kind of skin beneath it. Maybe he\u0027d been wrong; maybe this was exactly the kind of situation he was looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you sensed me, huh?\" Danny said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guy moved strangely, as if he weren\u0027t comfortable in his own skin, and his eyes were crazy, too, a milky yellow that reminded Danny of pus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey look kind of like mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t believe how fortuitous this is,\" the big man said. \"It saves me from having to find you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny chuckled, a throaty growl coming from somewhere in the vicinity of his toes. \"Well, you\u0027ve found me. Now what are you going to do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man tilted his round head to one side, studying him. \"Arrogance as well as anger,\" he observed. He smiled again, and this time Danny could see that the skin around his mouth was torn, as if he\u0027d opened his mouth too wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are indeed your father\u0027s son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny was taken aback. \"What do you mean by -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man moved faster than a guy that size had any right to move. He lunged and slapped him across the face with such force that Danny went down hard, the taste of his own blood filling his mouth. He liked the taste; it made him angry. Springing to his feet, he bared his fangs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come,\" the stranger said, motioning to him with his squared off fingers. \"Show me your potential.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny charged, swinging his fist as hard as he could. He relished the feel of his hand connecting, the texture of flesh tearing on the roughness of his knuckles. He punched the man again, and then a third time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man stumbled back, but didn\u0027t go down. He was bent over, covering his face, and Danny could see tatters of flesh hanging from between his fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, do I have potential, or what?\" he asked, running his rough, pointed tongue over his stained knuckles. Feeling like the badass he knew he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yes,\" the man replied. \"There\u0027s potential indeed. It appears that this world agrees with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man righted himself, and Danny gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face was practically gone, torn away to reveal a reptilian visage behind the mask of human flesh. Dropping down on all fours, his limbs bending in ways impossible to the human anatomy, the man - the thing - came at him across the rooftop. Danny stepped back as the creature sprang to its feet in front of him, bones popping obscenely as they reconfigured to reflect the armature of a biped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beast attacked, pummeling him again and again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny wanted to fight back, to release the bestial anger and frustration that had been building inside him for weeks, but shock stayed his hand, and all he could do was take the beating - blow after savage blow that drove him back across the rooftop. Finally he felt the backs of his legs hit the ledge, and then he was falling backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanic spiked through him, but then he felt a vice-like grip lock onto the front of his sweatshirt, and the relentless beast hauled him up and tossed him back onto the roof. Danny struggled to shake off the weird numbness he was feeling throughout his body, tried to ignore the trickling blood that ran freely from his injured face to stain the ground before him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You show me respect by not striking back,\" the monster said, the suit of flesh he wore hanging from his hands and face in tatters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Believe me, I would if I could,\" Danny said, spitting the taste of blood from his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monster smiled. \"Deep down, you know,\" it growled, \"your true self knows my identity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny scowled. \"Let me guess,\" he scoffed, \"you\u0027re my father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the monster nodded. \"Yes,\" it hissed, reaching up with its clawed hands to pull away the flesh that hid its true visage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No fucking way,\" Danny shrieked watching as the monstrosity revealed itself. \"It was a fucking joke! Y\u0027know, the whole Darth Vader thing . . . Jesus is this fucking bad!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your heritage is no joking matter,\" the demon said, sloughing off its skin and standing there in all its horrific glory. It was much taller than it had appeared within the man-flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny felt it deep inside. He didn\u0027t want to believe that something this awful could have anything to do with him, but he knew it was true - he felt it in every fiber of his changing being. This thing was somehow part of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis demon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe words left his mouth before he even had chance to stop them. \"What . . . what do you want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe demon glided toward him. He\u0027d never seen any living thing move in such a way. Freaky as it was, it was also strangely cool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve come for you,\" it said, reaching out one of its long, skeletal hands to touch his chest. \"To take you away from here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanny felt the fleshy growth beneath his clothing begin to throb painfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your true nature is screaming to emerge,\" it said. \"Eager to escape the restricting confines of humanity.\" The demon looked around, peering out over the city of Boston. \"And it is good that you leave here while you still can, for soon this will be nothing more than rubble and death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\" Danny said, shaking his head in confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The reverberations are felt across the world . . . across all dimensions. The Demogorgon approaches. I came back to the human world because I knew if I did not come now, soon there might have been no world left for me to visit. I came back . . . for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe demon held out his hand. \"Will you come with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monster that he was becoming chattered inside with glee, anxious to be part of something bigger, but Danny shook his head. He\u0027d heard about this thing before, the Demogorgon. Conan Doyle and the others were practically obsessed with it. This thing - the demon - talking about it made him understand for the first time what it really meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn\u0027t just another monster for them to thrash. The whole world really was in jeopardy. His mother would die. The world . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head again. Julia Ferrick had raised him as her son. No matter what he looked like, no matter what instincts he might have, under the skin he was still Danny Ferrick. She\u0027d given him humanity, and it was still strong inside of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not like you,\" he said, knowing there was only partial truth to his words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe demon smiled again, a Cheshire cat grin that chilled him to the very bone. \"But you will be,\" it said, reaching out to lovingly stroke his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You getting anything?\" Squire asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEve scowled at the hobgoblin, as the two of them walked down Newbury Street, on the hunt. \"You just asked me that a minute ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tilted her head back slightly, sniffing the cold, prewinter air. The November night was crisp. The glow of headlights washed over them, but she ignored them, searching for that scent. \"When I get something you\u0027ll be the first to know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquire grumbled, shoving his hands deep into the pockets of his leather jacket. \"It ain\u0027t right,\" he said, waiting for her to respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEve sighed. \"What isn\u0027t right, Squire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Funny you should ask,\" he responded. \"Don\u0027t you feel it? Something ain\u0027t right - it\u0027s all out of whack.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hated to admit it, but the little prick was right. There was definitely something not quite right of late. The air was filled with smells that didn\u0027t belong - aromas that weren\u0027t there before the nasty business with Sanguedolce, and the Nimble Man. Nasty things carried on the winds of change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think the son of a bitch has figured out how to mask his scent or something.\" Squire stopped to buy a pretzel from a vendor near Newbury Comics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe offered Eve a bite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"No thanks,\" she said, looking around, feeling a certain sense of futility to being out there tonight. \"Y\u0027know, I\u0027ll hate myself for saying this, but I think you\u0027re right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goblin feigned surprise, pretending to choke on his pretzel. \"What was that I heard?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh knock it off, you asshole. You heard me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, and it was music to my ears,\" he said, enjoying the moment immensely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey moved off of Newbury onto Massachusetts Avenue, walking across section of sidewalk that passed over the turnpike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s no good,\" she said. \"The signals I\u0027m getting are all wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told ya, it\u0027s fucked up,\" Squire said, finished with his snack, and licking his fingers clean of salt. \"I bet it\u0027s got something to do with that skinned body I saw,\" he said, stroking his chin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on,\" she said, turning onto Boylston Street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" he started. \"One of the bodies was partially eaten, but the other one was skinned. Why would he chew on one, but not the other, unless he didn\u0027t want to damage it? The skin\u0027s missing. What if it\u0027s not a trophy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEve paused and regarded him. \"You think he\u0027s wearing it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquire tapped a finger to his temple. \"That\u0027s the thought that I have. I\u0027ll bet he\u0027s using it to mask his nasty demon funk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve heard weirder theories,\" she said, waiting for traffic to thin before she started across the street toward the Hynes Convention Center.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA car beeped at them, and the two turned in unison to flip off the driver. They got to the other side and headed up the side street toward the Sheraton Hotel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What we need, no offense, is something with a more discerning sniffer,\" the hobgoblin said, tapping the side of his bulbous nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who do you have in mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled the nasty grin that always made her want to slap him, then abruptly shot across the street toward a parking garage that had once been attached to one of the city\u0027s better movie theaters, now turned barroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Y\u0027know, I\u0027ve kind of had my fill of parking garages lately,\" Eve called after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need some shadow,\" Squire hollered over his shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she caught up to him, the hobgoblin cast a sidelong glance at her, smiling broadly. \"You ever get one of those ideas where it just hits you over the fuckin\u0027 head, and you realize you\u0027re a genius?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Every day,\" she drawled. \"Why don\u0027t you tell me what your bright idea is and let me be the judge of your genius.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bright spotlight inside the parking garage created a deep patch of shadow next to a trash barrel with a bright orange top. \"Give me a few,\" he said, disappearing into the darkness just like he\u0027d dive into a deep pool of water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo matter how many times she\u0027d seen him do it, she was still impressed with what an amazing talent it was. Near invulnerability, superhuman strength, and animal-like reflexes were one thing, but the ability to travel using shadows? That was just too cool for words. Of course, she\u0027d never share that with him, the miserable piece of crap that he was. That would be the day when she ever admitted to being envious of Squire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning back against a nearby wall she turned her attention to the pool of shadow, attempting to peer inside its seemingly impenetrable depths, searching for any sign of the hobgoblin. She glanced at her watch, becoming antsy. She hated to stand around doing nothing. Conan Doyle was depending on them to come up with something, and even if they didn\u0027t she at least wanted to be able to explain to the arch mage that they\u0027d tried everything that they could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"C\u0027mon asshole,\" she muttered, pushing off the wall and moving closer to hobgoblin\u0027s entrance to the shadow path. She focused on the darkness. \"Hey,\" she yelled at it, hoping that wherever he was, he could hear her. \"We don\u0027t have all night, let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was seriously considering heading next door to the bar, when she heard something. Eve turned back to the shadow beside the trash barrel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that you?\" she asked, leaning toward the pool of inky black. \"If it\u0027s not, I\u0027m taking off to get a drink, and you can just -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beast exploded out of the darkness, pinning her to the ground with its mass. Its skin was as black as the shadows from which it sprang, powerful muscles rippling beneath. She hurled its growling bulk off her, springing to her feet as the nails on her hands morphed to talons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go, fucker,\" she said, studying the creature, not sure she\u0027d ever seen anything quite like it before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt eyed her from where it had landed, its beady, red eyes shining from within deep pools of shadows that made up its large, blocky head. It whined pathetically, tilting its head to one side; then sniffing the air in her general direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it, Fido,\" she sneered. \"Get a good whiff of the bitch that\u0027s gonna hand you your balls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt emitted a strange, garbled sound like it was barking under water. But it did not advance. Instead, it backed up and barked at her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEve hissed, flexing the claws on her elongated hands, preparing to strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" Squire asked, his head and body emerging from the shadows. He was holding a chain and spiked collar in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEve stared at him, gaze shifting from the hobgoblin to the slavering shadow beast and back. \"This is what we\u0027re going to use to track our demon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquire patted the front of his leg, and the large beast galloped over to him, its curled tail tucked between its legs, its strangely shaped ears hanging lower on its large head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did ya do to him?\" Squire asked, patting the beast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He attacked me,\" Eve tried to explain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shuck just got a little excited when I told him he was goin\u0027 for a walk,\" Squire explained. \"Got away from me before I could put his leash on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shuck?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s his name, and his species.\" The hobgoblin made baby noises toward the animal, allowing it to lick his face with a tongue that resembled a giant leech engorged with blood. \"He\u0027s a Black Shuck. A friend let me borrow him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s just disgusting,\" Eve said, watching as the beast continued to lick Squire\u0027s face as he slipped the collar over its enormous head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naw,\" Squire said affectionately. \"He\u0027s a good boy, ain\u0027t ya Shucky?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEve brushed the front of her leather jacket. \"It got schmutz all over me,\" she said, checking out the legs of her jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027ll be worth a little schmutz once you see what this bad-boy can do,\" the hobgoblin said, patting the side of the big beast. It sounded like he was beating on a drum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I take it shuck are good trackers?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The best when you\u0027re talkin\u0027 about demons,\" Squire explained. \"These guys hate the fuckers. It\u0027s a natural instinct they got.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEve crossed her arms, waiting to be impressed. \"Well?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquire smiled, holding on to Shuck\u0027s leash. He leaned forward and whispered in the animal\u0027s ear. \"Do ya smell it, boy?\" he asked. \"Where is it - can ya find the demon for us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShuck suddenly became very alert, its nose raised, sniffing eagerly. Then it began to growl, quickly padding toward the exit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See?\" Squire said proudly, as he was dragged along behind the beast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEve walked quickly behind the pair, curious as to how this would play out. They where heading back toward Beacon Street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s just taking us back to where we started,\" Eve yelled, scrambling to keep up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so,\" Squire said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe looks they were getting were something. People actually tried to stop Squire to ask what kind of dog Shuck was. The animal didn\u0027t give him a chance to answer, pulling him along at a good clip. The hobgoblin was practically running, his stubby little legs having a hard time keeping up with the nearly galloping shadow beast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scene of the crime had been cleaned up pretty well. Only the crime scene tape would have given away what had happened there, if they hadn\u0027t known. Shuck sniffed around a building across from the where the demon had struck and perked up abruptly. With a growl, he leaped over a black, wrought iron fence that separated two buildings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah shit!\" Eve heard Squire yelp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter, Mary?\" she said, coming to stand beside him. \"Did you lose your doggy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSquire stood at the gate, peering through the bars into the darkness. \"Nope, there he goes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEve looked in the direction of Squire\u0027s stubby, pointing finger and saw the black beast climbing, spider-like, up the side of the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not really a dog, is he?\" Eve said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never said he was.\" Squire looked around to make sure nobody was watching as he climbed the fence. \"I\u0027ll meet you up there,\" he said and dove into a pool of shadow, disappearing from sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great,\" she said, stepping back, gazing up toward the roof of the apartment building. Then she leaped over the wrought iron fence and, following Shuck\u0027s lead, began to climb up the side of the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEve threw her leg over the top of the roof, arriving just as Squire emerged from a puddle of darkness across from her. \"Where is he?\" she asked, searching for the animal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts flesh was so black it practically blended with the darkness of the night, but they spotted the beast lying down, chewing eagerly on something it had found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatcha got there, boy?\" Squire asked, walking over to the animal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt growled at him, baring razor sharp teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you growl at me, you ungrateful mutt!\" Squire snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Eve approached, it glared at her as well, but the animal\u0027s growling ceased at once, its long, pointed tail wagging furiously. As if presenting her with a gift, Shuck picked up what it had been gnawing on and brought it to her, dropping it at her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEve looked down, the smell of death wafting up from the large, bloody pile. \"That\u0027s skin, isn\u0027t it?\" She poked the flesh and strips of torn clothing with the pointed toe of her boot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It certainly is,\" Squire said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thought so.\" Eve looked back at the shuck. It was now sitting down, looking at her adoringly, tail wagging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt gave her the creeps. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stones-unturned-the-menagerie-3/page-9.html","bookId":2602,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:29:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:29:08 PM"}
