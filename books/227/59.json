No one doubted but that the day had come when, in accordance with their compact, Quasimodo, that is to say, the devil, was to carry off Claude Frollo, that is to say, the sorcerer. It was presumed that he had broken the body when taking the soul, like monkeys who break the shell to get at the nut.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThis is why the archdeacon was not interred in consecrated earth.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLouis XI. died a year later, in the month of August, 1483.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs for Pierre Gringoire, he succeeded in saving the goat, and he won success in tragedy. It appears that, after having tasted astrology, philosophy, architecture, hermetics,--all vanities, he returned to tragedy, vainest pursuit of all. This is what he called \"coming to a tragic end.\" This is what is to be read, on the subject of his dramatic triumphs, in 1483, in the accounts of the \"Ordinary:\" \"To Jehan Marchand and Pierre Gringoire, carpenter and composer, who have made and composed the mystery made at the Ch?telet of Paris, at the entry of Monsieur the Legate, and have ordered the personages, clothed and dressed the same, as in the said mystery was required; and likewise, for having made the scaffoldings thereto necessary; and for this deed,--one hundred livres.\"\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePhoebus de Chateaupers also came to a tragic end.
