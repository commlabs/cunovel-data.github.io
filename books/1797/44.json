He kissed her deeply as he slid one finger a short distance inside her damp channel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe erotic movement of his tongue echoed the motion of his stroking finger. The combination was wildly, unbearably thrilling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow it was Verity who was overcome with urgent desire. It swamped her as Jonas continued to caress her. The last of her fears vanished in the white hot heat of passion and she lifted herself against him in silent, feminine demand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas needed no further urging. He was hard and ready. She reached for him the way she had reached for him in the dark tunnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he came to her, his lips raining fire on her br**sts, his muscled hips pushing apart her soft thighs until his heavy shaft was poised against her body. He reached down to part her softness with long, sensitive fingers that trembled and then he drove himself into her, sheathing himself to the hilt with a shuddering groan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe impact of his sensual invasion sent a convulsive tremor through Verity. There was no real pain this time, but, just as she had the first time, she felt too tight and too stretched. She felt invaded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was still too new at this, she decided. Either that or Jonas was simply too big for her. All the small, delicate muscles in her lower body felt strained to the limit. She cried out, half in passion and half in protest, only to have the soft sound cut off by Jonas\u0027s mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay with me,\" Jonas muttered thickly against her lips. \"Don\u0027t leave me alone. Not now. Stay with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHold me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity opened her eyes, her breath coming quickly as her body slowly began to adjust around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe he wasn\u0027t too large, after all. Maybe he was just right for her. Jonas\u0027s fingers tightened on her shoulders and she looked up to find him staring down at her with molten eyes. He started to move within her, establishing a throbbing rhythm that radiated out to every nerve ending in Verity\u0027s body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt a strange tingling, clenching sensation begin deep within her as Jonas withdrew himself almost completely and then surged back into her. She could feel the whole, heavy length of him as he opened her small passage and occupied the soft, feminine territory. The sense of being pinned and invaded gave way to a spiraling sense of wanting that was new to her. She clung to him and felt herself tightening around him, seeking something she couldn\u0027t quite identify,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it, honey,\" Jonas grated, shuddering powerfully. His urgent words poured over her, coaxing, beseeching, commanding. \"That\u0027s the way. Give yourself to me. Let me have everything. God, I can feel you holding on to me like you\u0027ll never let me go. So hot, so tight. You\u0027re going to squeeze me dry. Let me get all the way inside. All the way. I don\u0027t want to think of anything else except how good you feel....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity\u0027s shivering, violent climax took her by surprise. She had not known what to expect, but when it washed through her she knew exactly what it was. She seized it eagerly with all her might and gave herself up to it and the man who had inspired it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes. Christ, yes. Yes. Yes.\" He shuddered heavily once more and then froze for an instant, eyes closed, face taut as he pumped out his own release.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there was only silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVerity came slowly back to herself, aware first of the storm that still beat against the windows and then of the weight of the man who sprawled on top of her. She lay quietly for a long moment, listening to his deep breathing while she enjoyed the lingering, relaxed contentment that pulsed within her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that was what it was all about. She smiled up at the ceiling and wriggled her toes. Then another jagged shaft of lightning lit the room and she saw the rapier lying on the floor. Memory returned in a rush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blade appeared wet in the platinum glare of the lightning, as if it had been dampened with fresh blood. The too-white light disappeared, plunging the room into merciful shadow. Verity\u0027s sense of peace and satisfaction shriveled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonas?\" She touched his shoulder. \"Jonas, are you awake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m awake.\" He made no move to lift his head from her breast. She felt his warm breath on her nipple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you... are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine. Thanks to you.\" He yawned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait a minute,\" Verity said, her tone sharpening. \"Don\u0027t you dare go to sleep on me, Jonas. I want to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSke slapped his shoulder lightly, reprovingly. He groaned in response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not in the morning,\" Verity said firmly. \"Now. What in the world happened to you tonight? What made you bring that sword in here? Did you have a nightmare?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas didn\u0027t react for so long that Verity began to fear he\u0027d gone to sleep after all. But finally he sighed heavily and shifted himself reluctantly to lie on his back beside her. He had one arm over his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You could call it that,\" he said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jonas...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took his arm away from his eyes and propped himself up on his elbow so that he could look down at her. His expression was remote and wary but his gaze seemed brilliant in the shadows. Florentine gold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a long story, Verity. Are you sure you want to hear it tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I most certainly do want to hear it tonight,\" she declared firmly, pulling herself up against the pillows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to know what happened. Do you have a lot of bad dreams?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not if I\u0027m careful,\" he drawled wryly and sat up on the edge of the bed. \"And believe me, I\u0027ve been very careful for the past five years.\" He got to his feet and paced to the window, where he stood looking out into the blackness of the storm. \"You\u0027re not going to understand or believe any of this, Verity. You\u0027ll think I\u0027m crazy. Sometimes I think I\u0027m crazy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Try me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"I\u0027d rather wait awhile. I\u0027d rather let you get to know me better so that you can trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to know what\u0027s going on, Jonas. For better or worse, we seem to have started something. If I\u0027m going to sleep with you, even occasionally, I must have some answers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mouth crooked wryly. \"So demanding. What a little despot you are, honey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have a right to know more about you, Jonas,\" she insisted with grave dignity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose that\u0027s true. Well, we might as well get this over with as quickly as possible. You\u0027re probably going to come unglued when you hear what I have to say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It takes a lot to make me come unglued,\" she stated with calm pride. \"My father gave me a practical sort of education, remember? I\u0027ve lived in a lot of places and I\u0027ve seen a lot of things. I may have been a virgin when you met me, but I have definitely not led a sheltered life. Dad doesn\u0027t believe in sheltering people.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-gold-gift-1/page-44.html","bookId":1797,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:07 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:27:07 PM"}
