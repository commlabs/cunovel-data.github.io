{"id":69504,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\u003cp\u003eLife could be a cruel hoax, Royce sharply reminded himself. He\u0027d been taught that time and time again. He wasn\u0027t about to lose everything that was important to him over a woman, even if she did have eyes that looked straight through him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mall was crowded, but then it generally was on weekends, especially now that folks were gearing up for Christmas. Royce allowed Kelly to drag him into the J. C. Penney store. But that was only the beginning of the ordeal. The jacket she was so keen on had sold out in her size. The helpful salesclerk had phoned three other stores and there wasn\u0027t a single one available. Even the catalog had sold out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, sweetheart,\" Royce told her. She was bitterly disappointed and trying hard not to show it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to look around for a different coat?\" Surely there was a father-of-the-year award for him in this offer. They\u0027d spent nearly an hour on this wild-goose chase already, and Royce\u0027s patience had worn paper thin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly sat on the wooden bench outside the department store, her head bent low. Royce was about to repeat the question when she shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How about something to drink?\" Royce was half an hour overdue for a cup of coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly nodded eagerly. She stood and slipped her small hand into his. She didn\u0027t do that often, and Royce guessed she did so now needing his reassurance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce bought her a Pepsi and himself a cup of fresh, hot coffee while Kelly scouted out a place for them to sit. Since it was close to noon, the tables were mostly occupied. They found one and sat down in the white wire chairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad,\" Kelly whispered excitedly, \"look at that pretty lady over there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHell, as far as Royce could see, the entire mall was filled with pretty ladies. \"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The one in the pink-and-green-and-blue jacket. Over there.\" Knowing it was impolite to point, Kelly wiggled her index finger back and forth in the general direction of where she wanted him to look. \"Look, she\u0027s sorta walking toward us. Hurry and look before she turns away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he\u0027d mused earlier, life could be filled with cruel hoaxes, and it was about to play another one on him now. Before he even realized what he was doing, Royce was on his feet. \"Hello, Catherine,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Royce.\" Her dark eyes were bright with surprise as well, and frankly, she didn\u0027t look any more pleased than he felt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you?\" he heard himself ask stiffly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad.\" Impatiently, Kelly tugged on the hem of his leather jacket. \"I like her coat...a whole lot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce watched as Catherine\u0027s eyes momentarily left his and landed on Kelly. Once again surprise registered in the dark depths, but was quickly replaced by a gentleness and warmth that tightened strong cords around his heart. He\u0027d never mentioned his daughter, and it was apparent she hadn\u0027t known he\u0027d been married. Maybe she thought he was married still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is my daughter, Kelly,\" Royce said, his voice low and throaty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Kelly. I\u0027m Catherine.\" She dragged her eyes away from him and held out her hand to his daughter. \"Your dad and I work together.\" She said this, Royce was convinced, as a reminder to them both. Hell, he didn\u0027t need it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your jacket is real pretty,\" Kelly said quietly. She continued to tug on Royce\u0027s sleeve until he was convinced she\u0027d pulled the armhole down to his elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What Kelly would like to know is where you bought it,\" Royce inserted dryly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if they have kid sizes?\" the ten-year-old asked excitedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got it right here in the-mall, in Jacobson\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad,\" Kelly said, pushing aside her drink, \"let\u0027s go look, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce glanced longingly at his coffee. He\u0027d barely had time to take a single sip. Kelly was looking at him as if to say Jacobson\u0027s was sure to sell out in the next ten minutes if they didn\u0027t get there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if they have kid sizes,\" Kelly stated urgently, as though another five or ten minutes was sure to make the difference. \"I know it\u0027s a ladies\u0027 store and everything, but you can wait outside if you want and I\u0027ll go in by myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why don\u0027t I take you down,\" Catherine suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a fair amount of self-control not to leap up and kiss her. \"You don\u0027t mind?\" He had to ask. Pride demanded that much, at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not a bit. Go ahead and enjoy your coffee,\" Catherine suggested, her gaze returning to him. \"We won\u0027t be more than a few minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should refuse. Royce knew it the minute she made the offer, but Kelly was looking up at him, her eyes alive with excitement, and before he could argue with himself, he nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA daughter, Catherine mused. Royce had a daughter. Catherine had worked with him for five weeks, and no one had bothered to mention the fact he\u0027d been married or that he was raising Kelly. The child was incredibly sweet, with long dark hair and eyes so blue they reminded Catherine of wild bluebonnets. Kelly was as gentle and cute as Royce was remote and indifferent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine had noted how closely Royce had watched her when he introduced Kelly. His eyes had darkened into a brittle defiance as though he expected her to do or say something about the fact she hadn\u0027t known about the child. She found herself staring at him and the proud lines of his chiseled features. Catherine\u0027s gaze had moved smoothly from father to daughter. There was no doubt in her mind the two were related. Kelly possessed the same beautiful blue eyes, and although her face was heart-shaped and feminine, she was clearly a Nyland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil she\u0027d walked into the shopping complex, Catherine hadn\u0027t realized how hungry she was for the sight of Royce. From clear across the other side of the mall, she\u0027d walked directly to his side, guided by instinct to the man who\u0027d dominated her thoughts for days on end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We went to the J. C. Penney store,\" Kelly explained as they walked side by side down the wide concourse, \"but all the jackets in my size were sold. We looked and looked and I was feeling really low so Dad bought me a Pepsi and then we saw you,\" Kelly explained in one giant breath. \"Your jacket is just perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine had bought it a couple of weeks earlier. Being new to the Pacific Northwest, she needed something heavier than a raincoat. The jacket had caught her eye in a ski shop, and although Catherine didn\u0027t ski, she\u0027d been attracted to the colors, just the way Kelly had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like it, too. And as I recall, they did have children\u0027s sizes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad doesn\u0027t like to shop much,\" Kelly explained as they wove their way between the moving crowd. \"He does it for me, but I know he\u0027d rather be watching a silly football game. Men are like that, you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I\u0027ve heard.\" As far as understanding the male of the species, Royce\u0027s daughter knew a whole lot more than Catherine did. For as long as she could remember, it had always been her and her mother. In college she\u0027d lived in a girls\u0027 dormitory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad tries real hard, but he doesn\u0027t understand a lot of things about girls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine couldn\u0027t help grinning at that. Evidently she wasn\u0027t the only one at a loss when it came to understanding the opposite sex. Apparently what she and Royce needed was a ten-year-old to straighten out their lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey found the store, and indeed there was a jacket almost identical to the one Catherine had that was in Kelly\u0027s size. After Royce\u0027s daughter tried it on and modeled it in front of a mirror, Catherine had the salesclerk put it on hold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly raced back to the large open eating area to tell Royce about the rare find. Catherine followed close behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s got pink and green and blue. Not the same shade of blue as Catherine\u0027s, but almost. I can have it, can\u0027t I?\" She dug into her small pocket at the top of her jeans and dragged out the five single dollar bills one at a time and then several coins from a different pocket. \"I\u0027ll pay for part of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoyce stood and tossed the empty coffee cup into the garbage. \"All right, all right. I know when I\u0027m defeated.\" He glanced over at Catherine and winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine couldn\u0027t believe it. The iceman winked as if he were a regular human being. Royce Nyland was one man in the office, another on the running track and someone else entirely different when he was with his daughter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...can see you\u0027ve got everything under control here,\" Catherine said, thinking she should probably leave. She felt awkward with Royce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t go,\" Kelly cried, reaching for Catherine\u0027s hand with both of her own. \"Dad said he\u0027d buy me pizza for lunch, and I want you to come, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure Catherine has other plans,\" Royce said matter-of-factly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine noted that he didn\u0027t repeat the invitation, which was just as well. Yet, she couldn\u0027t hold back the sense of disappointment. \"Yes, I do have some things to do. I was just going into the pet store to buy my cat a new litter box.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love the pet store,\" Kelly piped in eagerly. \"Once they even let me hold a new puppy. I wanted to buy it real bad, but Dad said we couldn\u0027t because there wouldn\u0027t be anyone home during the day to take care of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine\u0027s heart melted as she gazed down on Royce\u0027s daughter. So young and tender. Catherine remembered herself at that age and how life had been such a wonderful adventure then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, do come, Catherine. Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine\u0027s gaze moved to Royce. She expected his eyes to be cool and unreadable as they were so much of the time. Instead she found them troubled and unsure, yet inviting. Catherine felt as if the air had been sucked from her lungs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I...are you sure I wouldn\u0027t be intruding?\" By everything that was right, she knew she should refuse. They were standing so close to the fire, close enough to get burned, and yet they each seemed to be taking turns tossing kindling into the flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure,\" Royce answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, good,\" Kelly cried, seemingly unaware of the tension between Catherine and her father. \"I certainly hope you don\u0027t like anchovies. Dad gets them on his half whenever we order pizza. Those things are disgusting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA half hour later, they were sitting in a pizza parlor. Catherine and Kelly shared an Italian sausage and olive pizza pie while Royce ate his own, covered with the tiny fish both women found so offensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough it was comfortably warm inside the restaurant, Kelly insisted upon wearing her new coat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are those fingernails actually yours?\" Kelly asked halfway through the meal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatherine nodded, her mouth full of pizza.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean you don\u0027t have a single acrylic tip?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was incredible to Catherine that a ten-year-old knew about such things. \"Not even one,\" she assured the girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly\u0027s eyes widened with renewed respect. She held up her hand for Catherine to examine, showing the short, stubby ends of her own nails. Catherine reached for her purse and brought out her fingernail kit for Kelly to examine, explaining each instrument.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you two talking about?\" Royce demanded in mock exasperation. \"As near as I can figure, you women have your own language.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly reverently closed the case and returned it to Catherine. Her eyes drifted from Royce to her and then back again. Catherine could almost see the tiny wheels churning in the little girl\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you married, Catherine?\" The girl asked innocently enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah...no.\" Catherine\u0027s throat felt tight and dry all of a sudden.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither is my dad,\" the ten-year-old added, her words fraught with meaning. \"My mom died, you know?\" Kelly said it with complete lack of emotion, as though losing a mother was simply part of growing up. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/navy-woman-navy-4/page-6.html","bookId":1959,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:25 AM"}
