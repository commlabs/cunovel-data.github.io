I ache like hell, but I slept pretty well considering. Our position midway up the high-rise has kept us out of sight, separated by height from the rest of town. The apartment is filled with dark shadows and the dull blue-gray light of early morning. It\u0027s raining outside, and the rain clatters against the glass like someone\u0027s throwing stones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul\u0027s asleep in an armchair in the corner of the room, looking up at the ceiling with closed eyes, his head lolling back on his shoulders. Carol\u0027s curled up on the floor near his feet. I get up and stretch, looking around the dull room in daylight for the first time. The decor\u0027s badly dated, and the entire apartment\u0027s in a hell of a state as aresult of its owner\u0027s self-imposed incarceration, but it still feels strangely complete and untouched-isolated to a surprising extent from everything that\u0027s happened outside. I glance at my monochrome reflection in a long-silent TV, then pick up a framed photograph that still sits on top of the set. It\u0027s a twenty- or thirty-year-old wedding day memory. The guy\u0027s just about recognizable as the man from last night. His bride is the corpse next door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find Keith in the kitchen with a map spread out on a small Formica-topped table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right?\" he asks as I trudge toward him, eyes still full of sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. You?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nods and returns his attention to the map.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll get moving in a while,\" he announces. \"It\u0027s all quiet out there for now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look down at the map with him and start trying to work out the best route to Lizzie\u0027s sister\u0027s house. The same two circles representing the edge of the enemy encampment and their exclusion zone have been drawn on this map as on the one Preston showed me yesterday. Except the lines are in slightly different positions on this map. According to this, Lizzie\u0027s sister\u0027s house is just inside enemy territory. I point to roughly where the house is and look across at Keith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s where we need to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s where you think you need to go,\" he answers quickly. \"That\u0027s where we\u0027re going to try to go, but I\u0027m not promising anything. We\u0027re out here to find recruits. If we get your kid it\u0027s a bonus.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, but-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But nothing. We\u0027ll head in that direction and see how far we get.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he still going on about that damn kid of his?\" Carol says as she shuffles into the kitchen, bleary-eyed. She drags her feet across the sticky linoleum and lights up the first cigarette of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve already told him,\" Keith starts to say, trying (and failing) to stop her from getting involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got to let her go,\" she tells me, blowing smoke in my direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No I don\u0027t-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes you do. What\u0027s the point of looking for her? What are you going to do if you find her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just want to know that she\u0027s safe. I want her fighting alongside me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if you don\u0027t find her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I guess I\u0027ll...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Assuming she\u0027s still alive, what\u0027ll happen if you don\u0027t find her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll just carry on fighting wherever she is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly. So what difference does it make?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She needs me. She\u0027s only five.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I reckon you need her more than she needs you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bullshit!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not bullshit,\" she says, shaking her head and flicking ash into a sink filled with dirty plates and cups. \"I doubt she needs you at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStupid woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you not hear me? She\u0027s five years old. I don\u0027t even know if she can fight-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course she can fight. We can all fight. It\u0027s instinctive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, but what about food? What about keeping warm in the winter and dry in the rain? What if she gets hurt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll survive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll survive?! For Christ\u0027s sake, Carol, she can\u0027t even tie her own fucking shoelaces!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeith folds up his map and pushes his way between us, clearly fed up with being caught in the crossfire of our conversation. I shake my head in disbelief and follow him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to wake up and start living in the real world,\" Carol shouts after me. There\u0027s no point arguing, so I don\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re back in the van and ready to move within minutes of Paul waking up. The rain has eased, but the ground is still covered with puddles of dirty black rainwater that hide the potholes and debris and make it even more difficult to follow the roads than it was in the dark last night. Keith manages to avoid most of the obstructions, but when he oversteers to avoid an overturned trash can, one of the rear wheels clips something else. We go a few more yards, and then there\u0027s a sudden bang and hiss of air as a tire blows out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shit!\" Keith curses, thumping the wheel in frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Got a spare?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stops in the biggest patch of dry land we can find, and I get out. Paul follows me out and opens the back. He rummages around and manages to find the jack and other tools. The spare\u0027s underneath. He starts to get it out. While I\u0027m waiting I walk over to the other side of the road to where the contents of someone\u0027s front room have been strewn across the pavement. Their flat-screen TV lies smashed in the gutter, and an expensive-looking rain-soaked sofa hangs precariously out of the broken bay window. Before all this happened we each lived in relative privacy in individual brick-built boxes, what we did and how we did it hidden from view of the rest of the world by our walls, doors, and windows. Strange how the physical worlds of so many people are now as dilapidated and ruined as their emotional state. There\u0027s no privacy anymore, no boundaries. Everything we do is in full view and exposed. There\u0027s no longer any-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"McCoyne!\" Carol shouts at me from the van. \"Get out of the fucking way!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spin around quickly, but it\u0027s too late. Christ knows where he came from, but a powerful-looking man is running straight toward me. He\u0027s six foot tall and just as wide, and I can tell from the focus and intent in his wild, staring eyes that he\u0027s a Brute like those I saw back at the cull site. Does he not know we\u0027re on the same side?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" I try to say to him, \"we\u0027re-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis bulk belies his remarkable speed, and before I can move he\u0027s grabbed hold of my arm. He spins me around, then throws me over and slams me down onto my back. I\u0027m already winded and gasping when he drops down onto my chest, his knees forcing the air from my lungs with a violent cough. I try to shout for help, but there\u0027s no noise coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get off him, you fucking idiot,\" I hear Paul say. I manage to turn my head to the side and watch as he starts hitting the Brute with part of the jack from the van. The Brute doesn\u0027t react, barely even notices that he\u0027s being hit. He bears down on me, a bizarre mix of terror and excitement on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like you,\" I manage to squeak. \"I\u0027m like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorking together, Paul and Carol pull him away. They drag him back, drop him on his backside, then scatter like they\u0027ve just lit the fuse on a stick of dynamite. I try to scramble away, moving back until I hit the wall of the house behind me. The Brute springs up with a low, guttural, warning growl and looks at each of us in turn. Then, painfully slowly, realization seems to dawn. He looks from Paul to Carol to me again. Paul moves toward him with the jack, ready to attack. Carol pulls him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t aggravate him,\" she hisses. \"Just drop it and walk away. He doesn\u0027t know what he\u0027s doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul does as he\u0027s told, dropping the heavy metal tool, which clatters loudly on the ground. Carol stands motionless as the Brute looks her up and down, her back pressed up against the van. Then he slowly turns and slopes away. He\u0027s barely made ten yards when something else catches his eye and he breaks into a slow, loping run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell was that all about?\" I ask as I pick myself up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No fucking idea,\" Paul answers as he returns his attention to changing the tire. I watch the Brute until he\u0027s disappeared from view. Did he think I was one of them, or was I just in the wrong place at the wrong time? Did he see me and think I was Unchanged? Are the Brutes really like us, or was he reacting to a difference between us? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dog-blood-hater-2/page-14.html","bookId":2556,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:40 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:48:40 AM"}
