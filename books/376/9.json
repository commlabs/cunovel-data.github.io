A STRANGER APPEARS ON THE SCENE.","content":"\u0026nbsp;\"How do you like your step-father, Frank,\" asked Ben Cameron as the two boys were walking home from school together. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You mean Mr. Craven?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of course. He is your step-father, isn\u0027t he?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I suppose he is, but I don\u0027t like to think of him in that way.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Is he disagreeable, then?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He treats me well enough,\" said Frank, slowly; \"but, for all that, I dislike him. His appearance, his manners, his soft voice and stealthy ways are all disagreeable to me. As he is my mother\u0027s husband, I wish I could like him, but I can\u0027t.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I don\u0027t wonder at it, Frank. I don\u0027t fancy him myself.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [80]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Somehow, everything seems changed since he came. He seems to separate my mother from me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Well, Frank, I suppose you must make the best of it. If he doesn\u0027t interfere with you, that is one good thing. Some step-fathers would, you know.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He hasn\u0027t, so far; but sometimes I fear that he will in the future.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you any reason for thinking so?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A day or two since he called me, just as I was leaving the house to come and see you, and asked if I were willing to have him join with my mother as my guardian.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What did you say?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That I didn\u0027t want any change. He said the responsibility was too great for a woman.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What answer did you make?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That my mother could get as much help and advice as she needed, even if she were sole guardian.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Did he seem angry?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not at all. He turned it off very pleasantly, and said he would not detain me any longer.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [81]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then why should you feel uneasy?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I think there\u0027s something underhand about him. He seems to me like a cat that purrs and rubs herself against you, but has claws concealed, and is open to scratch when she gets ready.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ben laughed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The comparison does you credit, Frank,\" said he. \"There\u0027s something in it, too. Mr. Craven is like a catâ€”that is, in his ways; but I hope he won\u0027t show his claws.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"When he does I shall be ready for him,\" said Frank, stoutly. \"I am not afraid of him, but I don\u0027t like the idea of having such a person in the family.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They had arrived at this point in the conversation when they were met by a tall man, of dark complexion, who was evidently a stranger in the village. In a small town of two thousand inhabitants, where every person is known to every other, a strange face attracts attention, and the boys regarded this man with curiosity. He paused as they neared him, and, looking from one to the other, inquired:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [82]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Can you direct me to Mr. Craven\u0027s office?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The two boys exchanged glances.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Frank answered:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It is that small building on the left-hand side of the street, but I am not sure whether he is there yet.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Curious to know how the boy came to know so much of Mr. Craven\u0027s movements, the stranger said:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you know him?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, sir; he is my step-father.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was the first time he had ever made the statement, and, true as he knew it to be, he made it with rising color and a strange reluctance.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, indeed!\" returned the stranger, looking very much surprised. \"He is your step-father?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes; he married my mother,\" said Frank, hurriedly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then you think he may not have come to the office yet?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"There he is, just opening the door,\" said Ben, pointing to Mr. Craven, who, unaware of the interest his appearance excited, was just opening [83] the door of the office, in which he was really beginning to do a little business. His marriage to a woman of property, and the reports which had leaked out that he had a competence of his own, had inspired a degree of confidence in him which before had not existed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Thank you,\" said the stranger. \"As he is in, I will call upon him.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2968/81711.html","bookId":376,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 11:21:01 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 11:21:01 AM"}
