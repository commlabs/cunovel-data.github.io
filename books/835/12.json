Moreover, all that he had gone through since Hilary’s angry dismissal had tended to bring out the sterner and sadder side of his nature. He was respected as an indefatigable worker, but few really appreciated him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Fortunately, he had found his complement in Joscelyn Hey-worth, a cheerful, buoyant and extremely sociable young officer, whose friendship had done much to save him from falling a prey to the bitterness too apt to overtake those who defend an unpopular truth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He had also one other firm friend in the regiment—Major Locke, a grey-haired, middle-aged man, who had served in the German wars.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Major was a character, and anyone looking at him as he sat one cold April evening in the chimney corner of a snug room at Gloucester would have fancied from his melancholy voice and long, grave face that he was a most strait-laced Puritan. Voice and face alike belied him, however, for he was, in truth, the wag of the regiment; and an occasional twinkle in his light grey eyes led a few shrewd people to suspect that he usually had a hand in the practical jokes which now and then relieved the tedium of the campaign. His jokes were always of a good-natured order, and had done much to keep up the men’s spirits through that hard winter, with its arduous night marches, its privations and its desultory warfare.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Town after town had yielded to Sir William Waller, but the net result of the war was at present small.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On this evening the officers had dispersed soon after supper, weary with thirty-six hours of difficult manoeuvring, and one or two sharp skirmishes but they had been triumphantly successful in cutting through Prince Maurice’s army, owing to Waller’s skilful tactics, and all were now inclined to snatch a good night’s rest in the comfortable quarters assigned them at Gloucester.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gabriel, dead beat with sheer hard work, had fallen sound asleep in a high-backed arm-chair by the fire long before the others had satisfied their hunger; he woke, however, with a start as they rose from the table, responding sleepily to the general “good night,” but loth to stir from his nook.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Come, my boy,” said the Major, “why sleep dog-fashion when, for once, you may have a bed like a good Christian?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I will wait till Captain Heyworth comes back,” said Gabriel stretching himself and yawning in truly canine fashion.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And that will not be over soon, for he will linger at Mr. Bennett’s house, chatting to pretty Mistress Coriton, his promised bride.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “’Tis like enough,” said Gabriel, with a sigh, recalling a glimpse he had had of Clemency Coriton’s love-lit eyes as her betrothed had marched past the gabled house in the Close that evening. How they contrasted with those dark grey eyes which had flashed with such haughty defiance as Hilary had spoken her last hard words to him—“I will look on your face no more!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “H’m,” said the Major, “here he comes an I mistake not just as I had hit on a first rate trick to play him. No, ’tis one that knocks—see who it is, my boy, we want no visitors at this hour.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gabriel crossed the room and threw open the door. A tall, handsome man, apparently about thirty, stood without, his long, tawny red hair, his fawn-coloured cloak, lined with scarlet, his rakish-looking hat with its sweeping feathers, together with the scarlet ribbons which were the badge of the Royalists, made him rather a startling apparition in the Puritan city of Gloucester, and especially at Sir William Waller’s headquarters.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Is Major Locke within? they told me I should find him here,” he said in a voice which had something peculiarly genial in its mellow tones..\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “The Major is here, sir,” said Gabriel, ushering him in and wondering much who he could be.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “What, you, Squire Norton!” exclaimed Major Locke in astonishment, as he greeted him civilly, but with marked coldness—“Colonel Norton, at your service,” said the visitor, with a short laugh that entirely lacked the pleasantness of his voice in speaking. “You are surprised to see me in the godly city of Gloucester.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, sir, you are certainly the last person I should have desired as a visitor,” said the Major, bluntly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Major Locke was my most frank and outspoken neighbour,” said Norton, turning with one of his flashing smiles to Gabriel. “Next to a good friend commend me to a whole-hearted enemy who hates with a righteous and altogether thorough hatred. But, my worthy Major, you, as one of the godly party, should really obey all Scriptural injunctions. Is it not written, ‘If thine enemy thirst, give him drink’?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Lieutenant Harford,” said the Major, in his most lugubrious voice, “see that this gentleman has all that he requires. And in the meantime, Colonel Norton, I must ask you to explain your presence here.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I accompanied a friend of mine who was allowed to pass the gates to-night with a letter from Prince Maurice to Sir William Waller. Your General is now writing the answer, and I had leave to seek you out on a private matter.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I desire no private dealing with you, sir,” said the Major, stiffly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Norton laughed as he replied, “If Lieutenant Harford, who has so courteously heaped coals of fire on my head by filling me this excellent cup of sack, will withdraw, I will explain to you what I mean, Major. I assure you my intentions are wholly honourable.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Major made an expressive gesture of the shoulders, evidently doubting whether he and his visitor put the same construction on that last word. Gabriel bowed and was about to leave the room when his friend checked him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Do not go, Lieutenant,” he said, decidedly. “I wish to have you present as long as Colonel Norton remains.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “As you will,” said Norton, easily. “I am here entirely in your interest, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Major drummed impatiently on the table.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You seem to doubt that I have an eye to your interests,” said Norton, laughing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, sir, I have known you all your life, and I dare swear ’tis the first time you have considered anyone except yourself,” said Major Locke, sententiously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You have a cursed long memory,” said Norton, cheerfully. “But look you, Major, I know for a certainty that, early to-morrow, Prince Maurice will send troops to besiege your house. The Manor is in a position which will serve his purpose, and he intends to have a garrison there. Your property will be ruined, your household turned out, or should they resist, made prisoners, or mayhap, slaughtered. With one word you can save such a disaster.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “And pray what word may that be?” said the Major, frowning.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Your word of honour that you will give me your daughter Helena in marriage.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The Major flushed angrily.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Sir,” he said, indignantly, “to that request you have already had your answer.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “But the times have changed, Major, and I warn you that your answer had best change with them. Do you not see that I have your whole property in my power? Speak only this word and I will contrive that the Manor shall not be attacked, the Prince will easily be diverted from his plan, and I will get a special letter of protection for your whole household.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Rather than see my daughter wedded to you,” said the Major, sternly, “I would kill her with my own hand.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I believe you would, my sturdy Virginius,” said Norton, with a laugh. “However, I trust you will not come across her. To-morrow, when the Manor yields to Prince Maurice, my first thought shall be to take pretty Mistress Helena under my protection—no need in time of war for parsons or bridal ceremonies.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e At that the Major sprang forward white with anger, and struck Norton on the mouth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Curse you!” cried the Colonel, drawing his sword. “If you will force a quarrel upon me, let us fight it out at once; but I call the Lieutenant to witness that the provocation——”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Hold your lying tongue, sir,” said the Major, pushing back the table and whipping out his sword, and the next moment the sharp clash of the blades rang through the room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Gabriel was entirely absorbed in watching the combatants; he did not notice that a stalwart gentleman, with long, light brown hair and a short, pointed beard, had quietly opened the door behind him, and he started violently when Sir William Waller strode across the room, Joscelyn Heyworth closing the door as he followed his chief.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Gentlemen!” exclaimed the General, striking up their swords. “What is the meaning of this?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Sir,” said the Major, “I was bound to avenge a gross insult to my daughter.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You must not fight a duel here,” said Sir William, sternly. “Colonel Norton has a free pass, and I am bound to see that he returns in safety to Prince Maurice.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “It is an entirely private matter, sir,” said Norton. “It will be a satisfaction to us both to carry the matter through.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Very possibly,” said Waller, giving Norton a keen glance with his blue-grey eyes, and quickly taking the measure of the man. “But private affairs, sir, must ever yield to public duties. Your companion awaits you, with my letter in reply to the Prince. I wish you good night, sir.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Norton, with a shrug of the shoulders sheathed his sword, donned his doublet and cloak, and, with a sweeping bow, waved his hat in farewell.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Good-night, gentlemen,” he said, with easy courtesy. “Major, to our next merry meeting!” and with an ironical smile and a mockingly profound bow to his enemy he strode out of the room.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I crave your pardon, sir,” said Major Locke, “but when that wolf in sheep’s clothing shamelessly proclaimed his wicked designs on my child I could not restrain myself.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, Major, we will say no more of the matter,” said Waller. “I can well understand that your feelings as a father overpowered all remembrance of your duty as an officer.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Sir, I implore you to let me ride home at once and place my daughter out of this villain’s reach. He tells me that early to-morrow Prince Maurice intends to attack my Manor House, with a view to having a garrison there.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “These outlying garrisons are the curse of the country,” said Waller, stroking his moustache meditatively. “Is your house capable of standing a siege if we sent a detachment to help them?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, sir, not at such short notice, though it could be made a formidable place had we time.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I cannot let you go off on a private errand to-night, Major. You are indispensable to me, and I have given my word to Massey that I will join him at Tewkesbury early tomorrow morning. We must march from here in three hours’ time.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The poor Major moved away with a look of such despair that Waller, always a most kindly and considerate man, hastily turned over in his mind two or three schemes for aiding him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “You say you could place your daughter out of Norton’s reach. Where could you place her?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Here, sir, in Gloucester, under the care of my trusty friend, Alderman Pury. I know he would shelter her.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, let your servant ride home now and fetch the lady, rejoining you to-morrow evening at Tewkesbury.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “My servant, sir, is the veriest dolt; I could not trust him with so risky a piece of work. Prince Maurice’s army is in the near neighbourhood.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Sir,” said Gabriel, coming forward, eagerly, “I beg you to let me serve Major Locke in this matter. I was at school at Gloucester and know the neighbourhood well.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “So ho, young knight-errant!” said Waller, with his genial laugh. “You are in hot haste to rescue this fair lady, and I like you the better for it. But you are somewhat young for so hazardous a venture. We cannot tell what tricks this Colonel Norton may devise.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “If there were two of us, sir,” said Joscelyn Heyworth, “we might the better outwit him.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “So you would have me spare my galloper also? Well, tomorrow’s march is like to be a straightforward matter, not a difficult bit of manoeuvring like to-day. Rejoin the regiment to-morrow evening at Tewkesbury, and in the interval do what you can for Major Locke.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “We must leave our horses in Gloucester until we return with Mistress Helena,” said Gabriel. “They are hackneyed out with all the work they have had.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “True. Latimer was sore spent,” said Joscelyn Heyworth. “I will send my man Moirison to hire fresh horses, and by-the-bye, Major, I think we shall do well to take him with us, he is a shrewd fellow, and three horsemen will make a better escort for your daughter.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Well, gentlemen, I can only accept your help very gratefully,” said Major Locke. “To have my little Nell safely sheltered in Gloucester will ease my mind greatly. While you see to the horses, I will write her a letter telling her what I would have her do.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I would have spared you if I could rightly have done so, Major,” said Waller, pausing with his hand on the door. “But a man who has been through the German wars is worth his weight in gold, and I am bound to think first of the public weal.”\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1855/53727.html","bookId":835,"creation":"Aug 5, 2019 1:30:36 AM","modification":"Aug 5, 2019 1:30:36 AM"}
