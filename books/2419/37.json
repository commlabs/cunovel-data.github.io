What I did this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA handwritten label on the tape said TECHSAN. It looked no different from the eighttracks Garrett used to keep in his car when I was a kid—certainly nothing worth dying for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you find?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight zipped his bag. \"What Pena will announce today. There\u0027s a sequence in the code that shouldn\u0027t be there. He\u0027ll blame it on the original programmers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The back door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight lay back on his bed, stared at the ceiling. \"It\u0027s a beautiful subroutine. Elegant, really. And until it\u0027s closed, nothing is safe— not a single file on a client\u0027s server, as long as they\u0027re running Techsan\u0027s product.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked out the window. The yard below was balding crabgrass, lined by a wooden fence with missing planks. A barbecue pit squatted between a tool shed and scraggly hibiscus bushes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said you had good news.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It depends on whether you find Garrett,\" Dwight replied. \"Whether he\u0027ll help. I heard—I heard about Ms. McBride. I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can Garrett help?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it would be possible to track where the stolen files were diverted to. I\u0027m not sure. This isn\u0027t my area of expertise. But if Garrett got into the source code, if he retraced the steps of the original sender, identified the packet sniffer and the PGP key involved—he might be able to triangulate an IP address.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In English?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Find the saboteur.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before, Garrett couldn\u0027t even find the problem in his own code.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight\u0027s ears turned red. Apparently, the idea that he\u0027d found something Garrett had missed embarrassed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the backyard, one of the smaller boys—John, maybe—ducked under a loose board in the fence. He was carrying a VCR that was much too big for him. It was partially wrapped in a blue towel. He saw me watching from the window and froze. He slid the VCR behind the nearest hibiscus bush and walked toward the house, trying not to run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scene made me feel sad down to my bones. I\u0027d seen my share of disturbed children in eight years of PI work, but never so many in one place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hell of it was, I wasn\u0027t going to talk to the kid about it. I wasn\u0027t even going to turn him in. I wondered how many days fanning the Leviathan you\u0027d get for stealing a VCR.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I talked to Maia this morning,\" I told Dwight. \"She had some information about Pena.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI told him about Maia\u0027s conversation with her new pal, the deputy in Burnet County.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight stared at his comic book collection, shook his head. \"That doesn\u0027t mean anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew he was adopted?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I knew. What difference does it make?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The harassment of the software developers, the disappearance of Adrienne Selak—I think that\u0027s just a small sample of what Matthew\u0027s capable of. His main agenda with Techsan isn\u0027t about money. It\u0027s personal—retribution.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight opened the trundle bed cabinet at his feet, yanked out an empty duffel bag. \"I told you—there\u0027s no reason the deal would be personal. He never met the Techsan principals before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matthew\u0027s age,\" I said. \"Born around \u002767. Clara Doebler, Jimmy\u0027s mother—she supposedly had an abortion around then, but just before Jimmy died he was searching birth certificates, asking questions— looking for that lost child. He was told that the child had been born— and I think Pena was the one who told him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you think . . .\" Dwight\u0027s throat seemed to be closing up. He shoved underwear into his bag. \"That\u0027s nuts.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clara had already lost custody of one child,\" I said. \"She couldn\u0027t bear to lose another one—not completely. She never had the abortion. She gave the child up instead. You said it yourself: Pena is treating this takeover differently. He\u0027s making it the centrepiece of his career. What better way to get revenge on your birth family than building on their ashes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve known Matthew almost fifteen years. He\u0027s never given any indication. He would never—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice faltered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The night Adrienne drowned,\" I said. \"You weren\u0027t with Pena, were you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight yanked a Hawaiian shirt from the drawer—the blue one with the yellow lotus designs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" he admitted. \"I lied. I lied to protect a guy who\u0027s helped me ever since college. When I walked aft that night, I ran into Matthew. I didn\u0027t see Adrienne go over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI just saw Matthew, frantic—coming my way, looking for help. We roused the whole damn ship together, didn\u0027t have time to talk about exactly what had happened. Later, when people started questioning us, I saw a kind of fear sink into Matthew\u0027s eyes, like he was suddenly realizing what they\u0027d accuse him of. He said that I\u0027d been with him when Adrienne fell. He told what had happened, only as if I\u0027d arrived a few moments earlier. I had to make a splitsecond decision. I went along with it. I didn\u0027t know what else to do. But he didn\u0027t kill her, Tres.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d spent years listening to people\u0027s stories, learning to separate out the lies. There wasn\u0027t anything suspicious in Dwight\u0027s voice. The night of Adrienne\u0027s drowning, some cop had merely committed the cardinal sin of interrogation—not isolating the witnesses prior to questioning. Somebody had done that, given Pena the chance to shape Dwight\u0027s testimony before he made it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re chasing ghosts,\" he told me. \"If you want me to, I\u0027ll go to the police, change what I said about that night on the boat. I\u0027ll help in any way I can. But if you go to them, say this is about some longlost child—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll think what the police have thought all along. That the obvious answer is the right answer. And all along, they\u0027ve been wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threw his duffel bag on the bed. He went to the bookshelf, pulled out a drawer, and began tossing papers and pictures. There were photos from Dwight\u0027s childhood, report cards, Christmas cards, college transcripts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to save your brother,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you don\u0027t want the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy face turned hot. \"What are you not telling me, Dwight? What\u0027s got you so upset?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shoved the drawer closed, stared at the documentation of his childhood on the shabby carpet. He kicked an old report card. \"I was trying to get up the nerve, Tres.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s a good idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said Garrett couldn\u0027t find the back door in the software. I don\u0027t think that was his problem at all. I\u0027m wondering if you already knew that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at me, waiting for some kind of confession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Dwight. I\u0027m lost here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up a leather belt from the shelf. \"The way the back door was written, the way it\u0027s embedded in the program. Not many people could do that, Tres. Not many programmers are that good, at Techsan or anywhere else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly then did I see where he was going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe walls of the little dark bedroom seemed to be closing in. I wanted to open the window, turn on the lights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight curled his belt into a limp snake, shoved it into his bag. \"Your brother wrote that damn back door, Tres. I\u0027m positive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 33\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time, I didn\u0027t fail to inform Maia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn our way to the marina, I told her and Detective Lopez what Dwight had said about the back door in the software—how Garrett might\u0027ve been responsible. My only consolation was that Maia and Lopez didn\u0027t know what to do with the information any more than I did. Lopez said he\u0027d call the High Tech Unit, bat the problem over to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we got to Point Lone Star, Clyde Simms was waiting at the gate, and he did not look delighted to see us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe removed the giant chain with the CLOSED sign, then followed us down to the water on his motorcycle. He unlocked the security gate at the pier, walked us down to where the Ruby, Too was docked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the matter?\" he growled at Lopez. \"Six hours\u0027 questioning, and you didn\u0027t get enough out of me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Mr. Simms,\" Lopez said courteously. \"You can wait here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde glared at me, like he wanted to have a very long conversation over beer and brass knuckles, but he said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn board Ruby\u0027s yacht, aluminium fingerprint powder covered the hatches and railings like pixie dust. Some evidence tech had left a surgical glove and a Ziploc bag on the pilot\u0027s deck. I could see Maia Lee taking mental notes, her defence lawyer\u0027s mind assessing the trial potential—sloppy handling of evidence, amateur crime scene processing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe went below. The Dell workstations were gone. There was nothing but dustless squares on the tables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Machines were impounded by High Tech,\" Lopez told us. \"Early reports—they\u0027d been wiped clean. Nothing to trace without a deep recovery method—very expensive, very timeconsuming. Kind of like my machine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia had been lifting pages on Ruby\u0027s wall calendar. She stopped on November, turned her attention to Lopez. \"Your machine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, counsellor.\" Lopez mimed a strike on a keyboard. \"I got mail. Message came in when I got back to the office this morning. I read it, hit the print command, froze my system to hell. You should\u0027ve seen the look on our tech guy\u0027s face when he rebooted and got a screenful of static.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The killer,\" I said, understanding. \"The killer emailed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLopez looked like he was trying to swallow a foul taste out of his mouth. \"Anything\u0027s possible, Navarre, once you get some local press. The Techsan buyout, Jimmy Doebler\u0027s murder—both have been in the news the last few days. We got our share of hackers in Austin. Could be some seventeenyearold looking for something to do on his summer vacation. But this emailer—he claimed he shot Jimmy Doebler. He knew the calibre of the weapon. He also said something interesting—said it was a hideandseek game now. He thanked me for closing my eyes and counting to ten while he slipped off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boat rose and fell gently under my feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone\u0027s toying with you,\" I said. \"It isn\u0027t Garrett.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not, Navarre. It\u0027s never Garrett. I got an APB out for the killer and that\u0027s the first line of the description—It\u0027s not Garrett. Now if you don\u0027t mind, maybe you could tell me what you expected to find here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia brushed past him, went into the sleeping cabin. We followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing had changed in the bedroom as far as I could see. Maia studied the photos, the Lake Travis wall map with its green and red pushpins. The nightstand drawer was open. There was no gun inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Scuba equipment?\" Maia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLopez shook his head. \"We don\u0027t know what was normally aboard, and Mr. Simms wasn\u0027t much help. He said Ruby often stored a dive\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etank or two on board. There weren\u0027t any when we got here. That doesn\u0027t necessarily mean anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOut the small porthole window, the lake was hazy. A momentary slice of sun made its way through the rain clouds. Smoke rose from a barbecue at the public park. A hawk circled the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLopez\u0027s cell phone rang. He answered, listened for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaia came over to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The email,\" she said. \"Pena.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it\u0027s wiped off the hard drive, there\u0027s no proof.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the spring, I got several messages like that, Tres. I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLopez was looking at the ceiling. He said into the phone, \"Yeah. You\u0027re probably right about that.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-devil-went-down-to-austin-tres-navarre-4/page-37.html","bookId":2419,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:30:44 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:30:44 PM"}
