It was the doctor’s research partner back in Dubai—Petra—the one who had drugged Gray back on the boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill shell-shocked, Seichan missed the woman’s first few words before her hearing returned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“… Such promise,” Petra said. “You were of the Lineage, of our blood. You were being groomed for so much more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan had difficulty making sense of her statements. Back on the boat in Dubai, she had suspected this woman had been raised as she had: the muscular surety of her movements, the hard glint of perpetual vigilance, the cold calculation to her countenance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a monster to recognize a monster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman’s words echoed in her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e… groomed for so much more …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas this what she would have become?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA worse fear rose from the marrow of her bones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAm I that already?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan remained crouched, but she moved her left leg an inch forward, for better balance, for better power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman noted this. She repositioned her weapon and shifted to the side, ruining Seichan’s preparation, reaching the perfect spot where it would be awkward for Seichan to attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stared each other down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When you turned traitor against us,” Petra said, “you became a corrupted thing, a broken vessel, leaving the purity of the Lineage. For what? For the love of a man?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan stiffened, the words poking a raw nerve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePetra must have sensed her reaction, her words hard with disdain. “Such a piteous waste. Better you die like a dog than live like one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePetra fired—but Seichan was already moving as the muscles in her opponent’s forearm tightened in anticipation of the recoil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bullet still burned a hot line across her flank as she twisted to the side, offering less of a target. She hit Petra in the shins with her shoulder, flipping the woman high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan rolled, ready to go for the woman’s weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Petra never lost it. She landed on a knee, one leg back, still facing Seichan, her gun still pointed at her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, Seichan knew two things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s better than me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the worse for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed her eyes—and pictured one face, one regret—as the pistol fired again and again at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd a ghostly wind rushed past her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rounds burned into Robert’s chest as he threw himself between the woman and the weapon, blocking her fully with his broad body, a wall before a flower. The pain was a small thing against the enormity of what might be lost if he failed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Gray was there, sliding into the room with the automatic rifle from the dead guard in the hallway. He fired on full auto, blasting Petra back—and he never stopped shooting until the clip emptied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly then did he whip around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seichan …” Gray said, sliding to her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert knew the man loved her, saw it in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had loved a woman as much as that once, too. He met her while he was a young ambassador to Southeast Asia. He pictured her sweet face aglow under the moonlight in the garden, lost in the drift of cherry blossoms, her lips as soft as the whispery song of thrushes in the branches and the tinkle of a fountain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was always the emerald of her eyes he returned to, the intensity reflecting all inside her, never dimming. Her love, a reflection of his own, was forever frozen in jade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran the edge of his thumb along her cheekbone, letting his adoration shine—and at that moment, time shifted, but not those eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever those eyes …\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t know he had fallen into Seichan’s arms. His hand was raised, touching gently, something forever forbidden him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing then it was right he die here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his daughter’s arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan held the man, not understanding, baffled by the sudden tears in her eyes. The barrage of bullets had knocked him back into her arms. She caught him, the man who had cast his life aside for her, the same man who had imprisoned her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared up silently at her as if drinking her in, raising a hand to touch her cheek. And strangely still, she let him, seeing something in his eyes that she could not deny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray returned to her side, dropping next to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe assassin was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman had a name, but those five letters held no meaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, she was nameless, just purpose in human form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan stared at the bloody ruin, then turned away again, suddenly freer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will not be you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I’m stronger for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray slipped an arm around her. “Seichan …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was the simple answer. She had a name, spoken by someone who gave it weight, depth, meaning, and substance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in that moment, she learned she had another name, one forever unknown. The man dying in her arms told her. His arm dropped, too weak now, his breath a whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have your mother’s eyes …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrembling fingers found hers, perhaps sensing her shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I tried to protect you, to hide you … to keep you from them.” His eyes never left her face. “But after your mother was taken … it took so long to find you. When I did, I couldn’t let you go … selfish … but to acknowledge you would have been your death. So I hid you in plain sight within the Guild, close but forever apart. I was blind, naïve to the cruelties that would be inflicted on you, would be asked of you later … I’m sorry …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan did not know how to respond, drawn into the past, remembering that night, hiding under the bed, terror-stricken, as her mother was dragged away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFingers squeezed one last time, trying to hold on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeichan stared down at him, at the impossibility of her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your mother …” he said, his eyes wide with the urgency of those last words, the last gasp of meaning all sought during that final breath. “Escaped … still alive after … don’t know where …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his message sent, he sagged, hollowed out by his escaping life, relaxing into death. His eyes drifted closed. His last words were oddly clear and sad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No father should lose a daughter …”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith that, he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray pulled Seichan to him, holding her as she held her father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the world quaked, booming with the thunder of gods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e41\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJuly 4, 3:00 P.M. EST\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlue Ridge Mountains\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter hovered high as the world exploded below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeconds earlier, his parachute canopy had burst wide, becoming a wing of fabric overhead, jolting him in his harness—then the entire plateau bulged upward, reaching toward him with the heavy bass note of buried warheads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis teammates hung in the air to either side. Monk and Kowalski headed toward Kat’s position at the cliff’s edge. Tucker was several yards lower, skimming toward Lisa’s ledge beside the waterfall. He carried Kane strapped to his chest in a tandem harness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetween Painter’s legs, the entire landscape fell away, shattering apart, vanishing down into a growling pit of churning rock, fire, and steam. Entire sections of forest dropped into the hellish gorge. Smoke and rock dust blasted upward, swallowing his group. Twisting thermals wreaked havoc. Painter’s chute swung wildly and sailed higher on a column of superheated air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChoking, Painter held his breath and covered his face with an arm, protecting his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe fought his chute’s toggles to stabilize his spin, losing sight of the others. He had experienced this level of destruction once before. He recognized the superheated signature of thermobaric weapons—only never on a scale strong enough to raise a significant chunk of the earth’s crust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe initial plume whirled higher, dragging the worst of the smoke and superheated air away, clearing a glimpse to the ongoing destruction. Below, a gateway to hell opened: a gaping, steaming hole, breathing fire and stinking of brimstone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt its edges, more of the landscape succumbed. Hillsides slid, dragging trees and boulders. Rivers and creeks poured down that black throat, only to belch back out as clouds of steam. Down deeper, a heavy flow flooded the giant pit, boiling and stirring everything into a toxic soup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter stabilized his chute, sweeping out, catching a glimpse of twisted steel beams and honeycombed sections of concrete, fossilized hallmarks of man-made construction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe remains of a massive subterranean base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven these structures slowly vanished into the roiling mire at the bottom. Painter tore his gaze away, searching around him. The three other parachutes floated lower, managing the thermals better than he did. The curve of the cliff that was their destination remained intact, taller now, looming over that steaming sinkhole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Going for Kat,” Monk reported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Crapping my pants.” That was Kowalski.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pair dropped fast toward Kat’s position, angling into as much of a glide as possible, still fighting the unpredictable thermals. If they missed the cliff’s edge, they would go plummeting into the churning maw below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePainter twisted in his harness, spotted Tucker and Kane soaring toward Lisa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer ledge remained intact—little else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waterfall still fell alongside it, but there was no river below to catch it. The thirty-foot falls had become a three-hundred-foot plunge into smoky darkness. Farther away, a massive section of the cliff face broke away and slid, like a calving glacier, into the depths of the sinkhole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLisa’s ridge looked like it might fall at any time. Pieces were already chipping and cracking under it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut at the moment, that wasn’t her biggest danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shifting waterfall had driven her out of hiding—and into the view of the monster sharing her perch. The two crouched on opposite ends of the plateau.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Heading down to her!” Tucker radioed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Captain Wayne, go topside. Set a rope.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Negative. I’m past the point of no return. Too low, not enough lift to carry me to that edge. The only drop zone for me is that ledge of rock.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe might be lying, playing hero, but Painter was indeed higher. He had a better chance of reaching the top of the cliff, and someone had to secure the lines to reach the ledge below. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodline-sigma-force-8/page-71.html","bookId":1527,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:21 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:33:21 PM"}
