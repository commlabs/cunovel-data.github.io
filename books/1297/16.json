Agamemnon proposes to make their escape by night, which Ulysses withstands; to which Diomed adds his advice, that, wounded as they were, they should go forth and encourage the army with their presence, which advice is pursued. Juno, seeing the partiality of Jupiter to the Trojans, forms a design to over-reach him: she sets off her charms with the utmost care, and (the more surely to enchant him) obtains the magic girdle of Venus. She then applies herself to the god of sleep, and, with some difficulty, persuades him to seal the eyes of Jupiter: this done, she goes to mount Ida, where the god, at first sight, is ravished with her beauty, sinks in her embraces, and is laid asleep. Neptune takes advantage of his slumber, and succours the Greeks: Hector is struck to the ground with a prodigious stone by Ajax, and carried off from the battle: several actions succeed, till the Trojans, much distressed, are obliged to give way: the lesser Ajax signalizes himself in a particular manner.\n\u003cbr\u003e But not the genial feast, nor flowing bowl,\n\u003cbr\u003e Could charm the cares of Nestor\u0027s watchful soul;\n\u003cbr\u003e His startled ears the increasing cries attend;\n\u003cbr\u003e Then thus, impatient, to his wounded friend:\n\u003cbr\u003e \"What new alarm, divine Machaon, say,\n\u003cbr\u003e What mix\u0027d events attend this mighty day?\n\u003cbr\u003e Hark!
