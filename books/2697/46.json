We both know better. Bob Buckman who heads that office can really use your skills.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Starting salary?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fifteen grand higher than the standard because of the extra bullshit with the position. Possible yearly bonus.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m very interested in that one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled. “Thought you might be. I already sent the paperwork to your home address with all the pertinent information for the Wyoming Parks jobs. Along with three letters of recommendation from me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s…above and beyond, Dil. Thanks.” Rory should’ve left it at that, but she didn’t. “But I have to know what’s in it for you to share all the info about available positions?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As assistant Wyoming State Parks director, I want the best people for the jobs. You are a perfect candidate, Rory.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you came to Moorcroft to tell me you mailed me some paperwork?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDillon studied her for a moment before answering. “I’m here because of you and our unfinished business so don’t pretend that’s a big surprise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not pretending when I say your visit today caught me off guard.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Didn’t think you’d ever see me again? As soon as Cheyenne reflected in your rearview mirror you left all the memories behind?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePretty much, but it’d hurt Dillon if she admitted she rarely thought of him. “I have memories. We’ll both always have them, but it’s in the past.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what I don’t get. It’s not that far in the past. What did I do to make you turn away from me?” He paused. “Or maybe it’s what I didn’t do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRory knocked back a healthy swig of her drink. “I know it sounds like a line, but I’m being honest when I say it wasn’t you—not at all. It was one hundred percent me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDillon shook his head. “I loved you. I wanted to spend my life with you. Doesn’t—didn’t—that mean something to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why did you want to marry me in the first place?” she demanded. “What did we have in common besides that we worked together?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re both invested in our careers. We liked to watch movies. We liked to cook together. We both came from single-parent homes.” He frowned. “Doesn’t that seem like a lot to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It didn’t seem like enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat surprised him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn for a penny. “You were nice to me when I didn’t know anyone in the office. You took me under your wing and our relationship sprouted from there. We were comfortable together.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And again, there’s something wrong with that?” he asked tartly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. I realized I wanted more out of a marriage than just companionship.” She leaned closer. “If you’ll remember, we didn’t have sex all that often. There was no intimacy between us. No passion.” Rory held up her hand when he started to interrupt. “Please don’t tell me that passion fades and a steady partnership is what really matters.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDillon flushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I like you as a friend. And I mistook that friendship for something deeper. That’s why I said yes to your proposal. But it’s also the reason I broke it off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe food arrived and they both dug in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Dillon said, “There wasn’t someone else?” out of the blue, Rory choked on her asparagus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce she’d quit coughing, she assured him, “No, there wasn’t anyone else. I think the break up would’ve been easier for you to understand if there had been another man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. “Easier to stomach than the you lack passion and I foresaw a life of boredom with you answer I just got.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dillon. I didn’t say you lacked passion. I said there wasn’t passion between us—us—which means the blame falls squarely on my shoulders too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would it’ve made a difference if we would’ve talked about this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRory shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So it’s not fixable?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why would you want to fix it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You find it hard to believe that I’d want to try again?” Dillon took her hand. “You’re a beautiful woman. Smart and funny. You’re a great person, and I just let you walk out of my life without a fight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere wasn’t anything to fight for. What didn’t he understand about that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can change, Rory.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe froze. What was with men always spouting off that I can change bullshit line? And why did most women believe it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t you? Don’t you want to when it comes to Dalton?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry. I can tell this is upsetting you.” Dillon pointed to her steak. “Enjoy your dinner. We can talk about this after we’re done eating.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as she finished her meal, she felt like she’d swallowed a bowl of Mexican jumping beans. She needed to pace, move, do something besides sit here politely and eat food she couldn’t enjoy. She said, “Excuse me,” and fled from the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cut through the restaurant to the bathrooms and leaned against the hallway leading to the kitchen, taking a second to just breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy in the world would Dillon want to try again? She’d just laid out all the reasons why they hadn’t worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWait. Was she some sort of…self-challenge? To see if he could win her back? Men were stupidly egotistical about things like that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she walked past the men’s room, a short guy barreled right into her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shit, I wasn’t watching where I was goin’.” He looked up. A wide grin spread across his face. “Rory! Hey, are you working tonight?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Busby, I quit, remember?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No wonder I ain’t seen ya. So you here with Dalton?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBusby and Dalton were old friends and they’d run into him when they’d gone out. “No. I’m with someone else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat comment piqued Busby’s interest, rather than ending it. “Male or female? ’Cause if it’s a female friend, you could introduce me to her and then the four of us could go out on a double date.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn nosy man. “Not a woman. An old friend of mine from Cheyenne.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh. You guys goin’ next door?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Probably.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Save me a dance. It don’t bother me none that you’re taller than me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pervert just wanted to bury his face in her chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See ya.” He bustled away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut after she returned to the dining room, she noticed Busby hadn’t gone far. He eyed her from the bar as she sat next to Dillon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You all right?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine. I ran into someone I knew.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The band must be ready to start because everyone’s cleared out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m ready to go whenever you are.” She hoped he took that as she wanted to go home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDillon signaled the waitress for the check. “It’ll be fun to dance together since we didn’t get the chance during our brief engagement.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe met his gaze. “You dance?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. See? You don’t know everything about me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know enough. I know when you reached out to grab my hand I felt nothing. I know when I look in your eyes I don’t see burning desire that consumes you. I don’t feel a sense of urgency…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thanks for dinner,” she said as they waited in line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My pleasure. I think we broke new ground tonight by talking this out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat the hell? How had their discussion encouraged him? “Since I work tomorrow I’ll have to leave after the first set.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDillon paid the cover charge and they squeezed together at a tiny table in the back. “You want another drink?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m good. But go ahead if you want one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay. Be right back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot likely. They’d only staffed the bar with two bartenders. And this crowd liked to drink. She’d made three hundred bucks last time she’d worked this gig.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time Dillon returned, the band had started, making it hard to hold a conversation. That didn’t deter Dillon. He kept trying to talk to her and she kept saying, “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did give up beyond commenting on a song or to point out a dancing couple. After he drained his drink, he took her hand. “Let’s dance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily the first two songs were fast. Then the band announced the next song would end the first set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDillon pulled her closer and she winced when he tromped on her foot. “Sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRory caught herself trying to dance faster, like she could get this over with sooner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve been thinking about you a lot lately,” Dillon said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because of the job openings?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No. I miss you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why? We weren’t together that long and I’m not that cool.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDillon laughed. “I forgot that you’re so funny. Would it be so bad, giving me another shot?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop talking, Dillon. This isn’t going to happen.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me convince you another way.” He clamped his hands over her ears and mashed their faces together, laying a kiss on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. Dammit, no! She didn’t want this. She tried to twist her mouth free from his, but he held fast, his tongue pushing between her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he was ripped away from her and Dalton was in Dillon’s face. “What the fuck do you think you’re doin’ with her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDillon blinked with confusion then demanded, “What does it matter to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRory tried to step between them, but Dalton was immoveable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Answer the question.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is your problem, buddy?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My problem is you, fuckface.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Back off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Or I’ll make you back off,” Dillon snapped. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/redneck-romeo-rough-riders-15/page-46.html","bookId":2697,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:20 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:23:20 AM"}
