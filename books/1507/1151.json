He was the second most powerful next to Meng Hao, but he still had to struggle to lift his head up. When he did, he stared at Meng Hao, a conflicted expression in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched as Meng Hao approached, grabbed ahold of the chain that bound him and shook it violently, causing a huge tremor to run through it. It seemed like it was already on the verge of exploding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dao-Heaven, help me out here!” Meng Hao growled with a frown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are you saving me?” Dao-Heaven asked, feeling completely shaken, and initially holding back from cooperating. He was withering rapidly, and his Daos were being sucked away, and yet to him, his pride and dignity were more important than those things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao looked at Dao-Heaven and calmly said, “One day when I reach the pinnacle of everything, I don’t want to look back and find myself alone. More important than that, all of us... are from the Mountain and Sea Realm!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis words caused Dao-Heaven to tremble and stare in shock. Then he closed his eyes for a moment, after which his cultivation base exploded with power. He and Meng Hao worked together to completely shatter the chain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter Dao-Heaven was freed, blood sprayed out of his mouth, and he looked over at Meng Hao with an even more conflicted expression than before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDao-Heaven was completely stunned by Meng Hao\u0027s decision. He would never have imagined that Meng Hao would save him for such reasons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is it really true that, despite all the competition and fighting, in the end, we’re... on the same team?” he murmured. Finally, he threw his head back and laughed. Then he looked back at Meng Hao with the same complex look in his eyes. However, there was something else there, deep inside, something that had never before existed inside of him.... Admiration!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Dao-Heaven’s entire life, he had never admired anyone, not even Paragon Sea Dream. In his heart, she was simply an expert who was vastly more powerful than him. If there was anyone he could possibly have considered himself to admire, it might have been the statue inside of his Paragon Painting. But now Meng Hao was there in his heart, someone that he truly admired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t help but wonder if he would have made the decision to save everyone, were he in Meng Hao’s position. In the end, he wasn\u0027t sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly Dao-Heaven turned into a blur as he, along with Meng Hao and Yuwen Jian, quickly set about saving everyone else. Lin Cong looked even more conflicted than Dao-Heaven had. When he saw Meng Hao coming to shatter the chain that bound him, he thought back to everything that had happened between them, and couldn’t help feeling a bit guilty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn truth, there had never been any enmity between the two of them to begin with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” he said gruffly. There were few people in his life to whom he had ever uttered the words ‘thank you.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHan Qinglei was equally conflicted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I owe him a life!” he murmured inwardly as he watched the chain shattering. He didn’t say anything, but inwardly, he realized that killing people was easy, but saving them was difficult!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat difficulty lay within the heart, within a person’s capacity for righteousness. It had to do with one’s mental state!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFundamentally speaking, there were no irreconcilable differences between him and Meng Hao. The only thing that truly existed between them was competition. However, because no limitations had been placed on that competition, it had escalated to a deadly level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Meng Hao went about saving everyone, surprisingly, the Emperor did nothing to interfere. Zong Wuya also stood there silently. By the time Meng Hao had released everyone from the chains, the lands of the Windswept Realm were only 300 meters away from the huge net!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact... it was so close it seemed possible to reach out and touch it!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore... when Meng Hao looked up into the black hole, he could see a blurry figure with three heads and six arms. As soon as he laid eyes on it, his heart trembled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was you who killed my son!” a voice raged. The three-headed six-armed being glared at Meng Hao from behind the huge net.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao’s eyes glittered coldly, but he didn\u0027t say anything. Dao-Heaven and the others were arrayed behind him. Whether they were willing to admit it or not, as of this moment, Meng Hao was their leader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the black hole formed by the solitary World Essence light was getting bigger. However, it wasn’t nearly big enough to swallow up the entire Windswept Realm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Emperor laughed, a shrill laughter filled with decisiveness and madness. At the same time, his obsession deepened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My mission in life has been to lead the Windswept Realm away from the Mountain and Sea Realm and into freedom. I will give freedom to all coming generations of the Windswept Realm....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have sacrificed everything for that goal, and because of that, I can also give up everything. This was my mission, and my dream....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Immortals and Devils of the 33 Heavens, you can choose to distrust me, and you can distrust the blood and souls of the lives of the Windswept Realm. You can distrust the Immortals and you can distrust everyone. But there is one thing that you people... must trust!” The Emperor’s murmured words were intermixed with bitter laughter. He suddenly bit down on his tongue, which exploded, creating a chain reaction that destroyed his entire body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only thing which was left was his soul, which began to chant:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Great sacrifice....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Soul oath....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With my soul, I henceforth rebel against the Immortal World!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With my blood, I henceforth leave the Immortal World!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“With my will, I henceforth defy the Immortal World!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Henceforth, the Windswept Realm’s wind, snow, sky, land, mountains, rivers, vegetation, and all other living things... defect from the Immortal World!” As the Emperor spoke those words, the Windswept Realm began to vibrate. The rivers turned black, the mountains turned black, and the land turned black.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind howled, the snow roared, the land thundered, the mountains howled, the living things and even the vegetation cried out loudly!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of the cultivators in the Nine Nations of the Windswept Realm dropped to their knees to kowtow, then lifted their heads up and reiterated the words just spoken by the Emperor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Henceforth, we... defect from the Immortal World!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind turned black, the snow turned black, the land turned black, the vegetation withered, and at the same time, a black mark appeared on the foreheads of all of the cultivators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was... the mark of a traitorous rebel!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll living things began to speak out the desires of their souls, even the mortals. As they kowtowed, their voices rang out, backed by the power of their blood: “Henceforth, we... defect from the Immortal World!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack marks appeared on the foreheads of all living things. The cities turned black, as did all other objects within the Windswept Realm. All things... turned pitch black!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack sky, black lands, black wind, black snow, pitch black upon pitch black....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Windswept Realm was now completely different on a fundamental level. Deep inside, they became traitorous rebels, which immediately had an effect on the Windswept Realm’s 3,000 great Daos. Those Daos, natural laws, and Essences all became traitorous and rebellious!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire will of the Windswept Realm was traitorous and rebellious!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final thing to be affected was the sole World Essence light, which suddenly turned pitch black!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the black pillar of light became visible, Meng Hao, Dao-Heaven, and the other cultivators from the Mountain and Sea Realm felt astonishment shaking their hearts. When they looked around them, they saw a world of pitch darkness!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGradually, an archaic voice could be heard echoing out within the Windswept Realm. That voice seemed to come from the wind, lightning, snow, sky, land, vegetation, and all living things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Traitorous Sutra of...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Rebel Dao....”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat voice was actually the will of the entire Windswept Realm!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the voice rang out, the black beam of light pierced through the huge net, causing the black hole to expand even larger. As of this moment, the figures behind the huge net were powerless to do anything about what was happening. Their expressions flickered, and a fanatical greed appeared in their eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s....”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Traitorous Sutra of the Rebel Dao! Formed from a World Essence... it’s the Traitorous Sutra of the Rebel Dao!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the voices chorused out, the Emperor continued to speak from his soul, his own voice weak, yet ringing with the sound of obsession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“33 Heavens, do you... trust us now?!?!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA thunderous voice replied from the black hole, echoing filling the entire Windswept Realm. “We trust the Windswept Realm! The combined will of the entire Windswept Realm has formed the Traitorous Sutra of the Rebel Dao. Now... we trust you!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the black hole began to rapidly increase in size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the blink of an eye, it was large enough to swallow up the entire Windswept Realm. This black hole was a one-way teleportation portal, making it possible for the Windswept Realm to enter the 33 Heavens, but preventing the figures from the 33 Heavens from doing anything except wait in excitement for the Windswept Realm to arrive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice continued to speak out from within the black hole, and it trembled with hope and indescribable excitement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Windswept Realm, come... bring your... Traitorous Sutra of the Rebel Dao and offer it up to us!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We promise to make the Windswept Realm the 34th Heaven, and together, we will eternally suppress the Immortal World. Together, we can all enjoy the blessings of the true Dao!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimultaneously, the Windswept Realm rumbled as it got closer and closer to the black hole!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeng Hao shivered and began to breathe heavily. His eyes shone with a bright light as he stared at the black pillar of light. He wasn\u0027t sure exactly what was happening, but the complete rebellion of the Windswept Realm had caused the precious World Essence to change, becoming the Traitorous Sutra of the Rebel Dao. In response... all of the blood in his body began to boil!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly thought back to what the first generation Patriarch of the Fang Clan had said after he had absorbed the Nirvana Fruit. He had spoken of a mystery regarding the bloodline of the Fang Clan! [1. The first generation Patriach talked about the Fang Clan bloodline in \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.wuxiaworld.com/issth-index/issth-book-7-chapter-1005/\"\u003echapter 1005\u003c/a\u003e]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of the critical danger he was in, there was no time to ponder the subject at the moment. However, the mere fact that his blood felt like it was burning caused Meng Hao to recall that there was some secret related to the Fang Clan bloodline. He wasn’t sure what it was, but the sensation he was experiencing now caused him to be filled with an incredible thirst!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thirsted... for that Traitorous Sutra of the Rebel Dao!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if it were something of great importance to Meng Hao, and even more importantly... to the Fang Clan as a whole!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, the third Nirvana Fruit in his bag of holding was vibrating strongly, and he had the feeling that if he could get that Sutra, then he... would be able to fully absorb the Nirvana Fruit!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom that moment on, he would exceed the Allheaven Immortal and become... an Allheaven Dao Immortal!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, buried deep in the Fang Clan blood was something like the key to a great door. Once opened... the future of the Fang Clan would be one of splendor and glory!!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-7-chapter-1146\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-7-chapter-1148\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/i-shall-seal-the-heavens/issth-book-7-chapter-1147","bookId":1507,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 5:03:27 AM"}
