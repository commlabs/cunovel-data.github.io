{"id":12104,"no":132,"title":"CHAPTER CXXIX. THE TRIAL OF SWEENEY TODD CONTINUED.","content":"\u0026nbsp;The peculiar circumstances under which Sir Richard Blunt had found out all the villany of Todd, and overtook him and Mrs. Lovett in the midst of their iniquities, were well-known to the people assembled in the court, and some slight manifestations of applause greeted him as he stood up in the witness-box. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This exhibition of feeling was not noticed by the court, and the Attorney-General at once began his examination in chief.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Sir Richard,\" he said, \"will you have the kindness to put into the form of a narration, what you have to say concerning the charge upon which the prisoner at the bar is arraigned?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will do so,\" replied Sir Richard, and then after a moment\u0027s pause, during which you might have heard a pin drop in the court, so intense was the stillness, the magistrate gave his important testimony against the now trembling wretch at the bar of that solemn court.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A considerable time ago,\" he said, \"my attention was drawn to the circumstance that a number of persons had disappeared, who were residents about the neighbourhood of Fleet Street, and its vicinity. Such disappearances were totally and perfectly unaccountable. Not a trace could be found of very many respectable men, who had left their houses upon various objects, and never returned to them.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"The most striking peculiarity of this affair was, that the men who disappeared were for the most part great substantial citizens, who were far from likely to have yielded to any of those temptations that at times bring the young and the heedless in this great City into fearful dangers.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I saw the Secretary of State upon the subject; and it was agreed that I was to have a carte blanche, as regarded expenses, and that I was to give nearly the whole of my time and attention to the unravelling of the mystery. It was then, that after my careful inquiry I found that out of thirteen disappearances no less than ten had declared their intention to be to get shaved, or their hair dressed, or to go through some process which required them to visit a barber. I then, personally, called at all the barber\u0027s shops in the neighbourhood, but never alone. To this fact of having some one waiting for me in the shop, I no doubt owe my life, for I have been eight times shaved and dressed by the prisoner at the bar.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Todd uttered a deep groan, and looked at Sir Richard as though he would have said窶能n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, that I had you the ninth time so much at my mercy!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n There was quite a sensation, and a shudder through the court, as Sir Richard then stated how many times he had run the fearful risk of death at the hands of such a man as Todd; and then Sir Richard went on with his narration, which deeply and powerfully interested the judge, counsel, jury, and spectators.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I did not find anything suspicious in the shop itself of the prisoner at the bar; although each of these times that I was within it, I looked at it narrowly; but I did find that he always made an effort to get the person who was with me to leave the shop upon some pretext or another, which, of course, never succeeded; and then without, in the least, appearing vexed at the failure, he would go on with his shaving in the coolest possible manner.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"This, however, was only suspicion, and I could take no advantage of it, unless something else developed itself likewise; but that was not long in happening. My attention was directed to the peculiar odour in St. Dunstan\u0027s Church, and from the moment that it was so, I in my own mind connected it with Sweeney Todd, and the disappearances of the persons who had so unaccountably been lost in the immediate neighbourhood of Fleet Street. In the midst of all this then, I had a formal application made to me concerning the disappearance of Mr. Francis Thornhill, who had been clearly traced to the shop of the prisoner at the bar, and never seen by any one to leave it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"From that moment I felt that it was in the prisoner\u0027s shop that the parties disappeared, but the means by which they were murdered remained a profound mystery, and I felt, that unless these means could be very distinctly proved, a conviction would be difficult. I instituted a careful search of the vaults beneath St. Dunstan\u0027s Church, and I found a secret passage communicating with the cellar of the pie shop in Bell Yard, and afterwards I found a similar passage communicating with the cellar under the prisoner\u0027s shop.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Upon reaching the latter cellar, the first object that presented itself to me was, a chair fixed to the roof by its legs. That chair I at once recognised as identically like the one in the shop, in which I had so frequently sat, and in a moment the whole truth burst upon me. The plank upon which the shaving chair rested, turned upon a centre, and could be so made to turn by a simple contrivance above, so that any unfortunate person could be let down in a moment, and the vacant or supplementary chair would come up and take the place of the one that had been above.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Prosecuting my researches, I found the skeleton of many persons in the vaults, and much putrid flesh, which fully accounted for the odour in St. Dunstan\u0027s Church. I found likewise that no meat from any butcher or salesman ever found its way to the pie-shop in Bell Yard. So upon research actuated by that fact, I found that the supply of flesh was human, and that was the way the prisoner at the bar got rid of a great portion of his victims.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Measures were taken to prevent any more murders, by some persons in my pay always following any one into the shop; and then, when the evidence was all ready by the finding and identification of Mr. Francis Thornhill\u0027s leg bone, I took measures to apprehend the prisoner at the bar. I shall, of course, be happy to answer any questions that may be asked of me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Attorney-General then spoke, saying窶能n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Have you found out by what means the shaving-chair in the shop of the prisoner was prevented from falling at the moment any one sat in it?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes. By a simple piece of mechanism which communicated with the parlour, he could release the swinging board or keep it firm at his pleasure. I have had a model of the whole of the apparatus and building, which will be laid before the jury. It is here in the hands of an officer.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Here you is,\" said Crotchet, coming forward with a large parcel in his hands, which, upon being taken from its case, was found to be an accurate representation of Todd\u0027s house, with the diabolical contrivances he had got together for the purpose of murder.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The model was handed to the jury, and excited immense and well deserved commendation.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have no further questions to ask of you, Sir Richard,\" said the Attorney-General; \"but I am sure the court and jury cannot but feel much indebted to you for the very lucid manner in which you have given your evidence.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"One moment, Sir Richard, if you please,\" said Todd\u0027s counsel as the magistrate was about to leave the witness box. \"I will not detain you for long.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am quite at your service, sir,\" said Sir Richard Blunt.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How was it then that after you felt convinced of the guilt of the prisoner at the bar, as you state that you were, although I think upon very insufficient grounds, that you did not at once arrest him? Does it not seem very strange that you permitted him for some weeks to go on just as usual?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I did not permit him to go on just as usual. I took every precaution to prevent him from adding to the list of his offences. It is well known that a person in my situation must not act upon his own convictions of the guilt of any party. It was absolutely necessary that I should be able to bring satisfactory proof before a jury of the guilt of the prisoner at the bar, and it would have been quite premature to arrest him until I had that proof.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And pray, Sir Richard, when did you consider you had that proof?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"When the surgeon was able to swear to a portion of the remains of Mr. Francis Thornhill.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, then I am to understand that you rest the case for the prosecution upon a bone?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I do not prosecute.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But you took the prisoner into custody, sir; and am I to believe that you did so solely on account of the finding a bone in some of the vaults of St. Dunstan\u0027s?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You can conclude so.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Oh, I can conclude so? Very well then. Gentleman of the jury, it appears that the whole case against the prisoner at the bar, my worthy and exemplary client, rests upon a bone. That will do, Sir Richard; we will not trouble you any further. Perhaps the court will stop the case, as it only rests upon a bone.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Not exactly,\" said the judge.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The next witness was the surgeon, and his evidence was listened to with great attention. He said窶能n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I was in the vaults of St. Dunstan\u0027s church, and I looked over a great quantity of osteological remains. Among those remains I found a male femur.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"A what, sir?\" said Todd\u0027s counsel.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It would be better,\" said the judge, mildly, \"if the witness would be so good as to give the vulgar names to what he may have to speak of, as the jury may well be excused for not being in possession of anatomical and scientific nomenclature.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will endeavour to do so,\" said the surgeon. \"I beg to assure the court, that it was from no feeling of pedantry that I used the scientific terms; but they are so common professionally, that they are used without thinking that they are other than the terms in common use.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"That is just the way I view it,\" said the judge, \"and the court had not the least idea of anything else. Pray go on, sir, with your evidence.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I found, then, a large quantity of human bones,\" said the surgeon, \"in the vaults of St. Dunstan\u0027s, and among them a male thigh-bone, which I have with me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Here he produced from his great-coat pocket the bone he spoke of, wrapped up in paper, and deliberately untying the string which bound the paper to it, he handed it to the jury. One of that body, more bold than the rest, took it, but several of the jurymen shrunk from it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Now, sir,\" said the Attorney-General, \"can you upon your oath, without the slightest reservation, take upon yourself to say whose thigh-bone this was?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I can. It was the thigh-bone of Mr. Francis Thornhill.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Will you state to the court and jury, the grounds upon which you arrive at that conclusion?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will, sir. Mr. Thornhill met with an accident of a tedious and painful nature. The external condyle or projection on the outer end of the thigh-bone, which makes part of the knee joint, was broken off, and there was a diagonal fracture about three inches higher up upon the bone. I had the sole care of the case, and although a cure was effected, it was not without considerable distortion of the bone, and general disarrangement of the parts adjacent. From my frequent examination I was perfectly well acquainted with the case, and I can swear that the bone in the hands of the jury was the one so broken, and to which I attended.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Very well, sir; that is all I wish to trouble you with.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Attorney-General sat down, but Todd\u0027s counsel rose, and said窶能n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Did you ever have a similar case to that of Mr. Thornhill\u0027s under your treatment?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Never a precisely similar one.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"But you have heard of such cases?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Certainly.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"They are sufficiently common, not to be positively rare and curious in the profession?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"They are not common, but still they do occur sufficiently often to lose the character of rarity.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Of course. You have no other means of identifying the bone, but by its having been fractured in the way you describe?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Certainly not.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Then, it may be the thigh-bone of any one who has suffered a similar injury.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With this remark, the counsel sat down, and the surgeon was permitted to retire. The bone was laid upon the counsel\u0027s table, and there it reposed a sad memento of poor Thornhill, and a mute but eloquent piece of evidence against the prisoner at the bar. Todd, however, did not seem to be at all moved at the sight of the relict of the murdered victim. Probably he had for too long a time been intimate with the remains of mortality, during the frightful trade he had carried on, for such a circumstance to touch him in any perceptible way.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The next witness called, was another medical man, who merely corroborated the ship\u0027s-surgeon, as to the fact of the bone produced having been fractured in the way described.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3276/89689.html","bookId":510,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 4:27:05 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 4:27:05 AM"}
