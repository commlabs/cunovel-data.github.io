And you mix blue and red together? And you get . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Purple!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Excellent, yes, you get purple. Babies are kind of like that. A little blue paint from the daddy, some red paint from the mommy, shake it all together, and boom—you get a whole new person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehopefully not purple, but if Aunt Delores is involved? Anything is possible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelores gives Drew the finger behind Mackenzie’s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMackenzie nods. And goes back to strumming her guitar. For one whole minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uncle Drew?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yep?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“how does the daddy’s blue paint get to the mommy’s red paint?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew raises both eyebrows. he stutters, “how . . . how does it . . . get there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMackenzie gestures with her hand. “Well, yeah. Does the doctor give her a shot of blue paint? Does the mommy swallow the blue paint?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew snickers. “Only if the daddy is a very lucky guy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelores smacks him on the head. But Mackenzie’s round blue eyes stay on Drew, waiting for an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe opens his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then closes it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe starts again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then stops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, like cannon-balling into a pool on the first day of spring, he takes the plunge. “Well . . . the mommy and daddy have sex.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s official. Alexandra’s going to kill him. For real this time. I’m going to be a widow before I’m ever a wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMackenzie’s face rumples with confusion. “What’s sex?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sex is how babies get made.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thinks about it a moment. And then she nods. “Oh. Okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I thought the final exams in business school were hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew handled that pretty well, don’t you think? he’s good with kids. Which makes sense, because in so many ways . . . he still is one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexandra walks into the room. She seems happy, now—now that she’s showed Steven that his “steel guns” can, in fact, be dented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s all glowy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are we doing in here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew smiles innocently. “Talking about paint colors.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexandra smiles and strokes her daughter’s hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Mackenzie adds, “And sex.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexandra’s hand stops. “Wait . . . what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew leans over and whispers in my ear, “We should probably leave the room now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the door swings closed behind us, we hear “Drew!” And Alexandra doesn’t sound so happy anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last, dinner is served. The actual eating of the meal is unevent-ful, but during dessert, Alexandra taps her glass with a spoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everyone—can I have your attention, please?” She beams at Steven and then goes on. “Mackenzie has an announcement she’d like to make.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMackenzie stands on her chair and proclaims, “My mom and dad had sex!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe entire table is silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil Matthew raises his glass. “Congratulations, Steven. It’s like halley’s Comet, right? You only get to come every seventy-five years?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelores laughs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd John clears his throat. Awkwardly. “That’s, ah . . . that’s . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003every nice, dear.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Frank decides to share. “Sex is good. Keeps you regular. I make sure I have sex at least three times a week. Not that my Estelle is into any of that freaky-freaky stuff, but in forty years of marriage, she’s never had a headache.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEstelle smiles proudly beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Matthew covers his face with his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of us just stare. Eyes wide, mouths slightly opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil Drew throws his head back and laughs. “That’s so great.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe wipes his eyes, practically crying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexandra shakes her head. “Wait. There’s more. Go ahead, Mackenzie.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMackenzie rolls her eyes. “Well, that means they’re gonna have a baby, of course. I’m gonna be a big sister!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCongratulations erupt all around. Anne tears up as she hugs her daughter. “I’m so happy for you, honey.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew stands and hugs his sister sweetly. “Congratulations, Lex.” Then he smacks Steven on the back. “I’ll keep the guest room ready for you, man.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m confused. “Guest room?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew explains. “The last time Alexandra was pregnant, she kicked Steven out—not once, not twice, but four f**king times.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew joins in. “And that’s not counting the time she let him stay, but she threw all his shit out the window.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew chuckles. “It looked like a Barney’s delivery truck exploded on Park Avenue. The homeless were never dressed so well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexandra rolls her eyes and turns to me. “Pregnancy hormones. They can cause some pretty bad mood swings. I tend to get a little . . . bitchy . . . when I’m pregnant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew smirks. “As opposed to the rest of the time, when you’re just so pleasant?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know how some dogs still keep chewing your shoes—no matter how many times you smack them with a newspaper? They just can’t resist?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew is one of those dogs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexandra turns on her brother like a cat hissing at a snake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know, Drew, being with child? It’s kind of like a ‘get out of jail free’ card. There’s not a jury in the country that would convict me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe backs away slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head at him, then ask Alexandra, “Other than that, how are you feeling?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugs. “Tired, mostly. And the vomiting doesn’t help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost women get morning sickness, but I get it at night, which sucks pretty bad.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHuh Vomiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey certainly sound familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat? Why are you looking at me like that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, no—everyone knows the surest sign of pregnancy is a missed period.
