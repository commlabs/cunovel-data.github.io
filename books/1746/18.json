It was the beginning of an amazing new phase for the time-travel operation, everyone agreed. The unique process that Stasis Technologies controlled would open the gateway to the historical past-would bring new and astounding knowledge of antiquity pouring into the twenty-first century, an incredible intellectual treasure. And perhaps treasure of another kind, some said: if they could reach back into any century of historic times and bring people back, why not scoop up works of art, rare books and manuscripts, valuable objects of all sorts? Overnight the resources of the museums of the world could be doubled, tripled, quadrupled! And everything in perfect condition-and at no expense other than the energy costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone in the company prayed that Project Middle Ages would come off without a hitch. Everyone but Edith Fellowes, who quietly prayed that it would fail. That Hoskins\u0027 theories would be wrong, or that die equipment would not be equal to the task. It was the only thing she could cling to, now-the only hope she had that Timmie would not die. If the attempt to bring a man forward from the fourteenth century turned out to be a flop, there\u0027d be no need to vacate the Stasis bubble that Timmie occupied. Then everydiing could go on as before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she hoped for the failure of the project; but the rest of the world hoped for its success. And, irrationally, Miss Fellowes hated the world for it. Project Middle Ages was reaching a climax of white-hot publicity now. The media and die public both were obsessed with it. It was a long time since Stasis Technologies, Ltd. had had anything to catch their attention. A new rock or another ancient fish would hardly stir diem. The litde dinosaur had caused a ripple in its time, but then they had forgotten about it. As for Timmie the Neanderthal, little Timmie the cave-boy, well, he might have held the public fancy for a while longer if he had been anything like the ferocious ape-child that some people had anticipated. But Stasis Technologies\u0027 Neanderthal had turned out not to be an ape-child at all, just an ugly litde boy. An ugly litde boy who wore overalls and had learned to read picture-books -what was exciting about diat? There was nothing very prehistoric about him any longer. Maybe if he bellowed in anger and hammered his fists against his chest, yes, and roared some savage primordial gibberish, that might have held their interest a litde longer. But diat wasn\u0027t Timmie\u0027s style.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA historical human, though-a full-grown person stepping out of die past, someone who had looked with his own eyes upon Joan of Arc or Richard the Lion-Hearted or Saladin-someone who could speak a known language, someone who could bring the pages of history to lifeThe weeks went by. The time came closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now the day of Zero Hour for Project Middle Ages was at hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoskins and his associates had learned a good deal about the techniques of public relations since the day of Timmie\u0027s arrival three years before. This time it wouldn\u0027t be a matter of a handful of onlookers on a balcony. This time the technicians of Stasis Technologies, Ltd., would play out their role before nearly all of mankind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Fellowes herself was all but savage with anticipation. She wanted the suspense to be over; she wanted to know whether the project would succeed or fail. She meant to be there in the assembly hall as the final switches were being thrown. If only the new relief orderly would show up so that she would be free to go over there- Mandy Terris was her name, she had been taken on last week, a replacement for Ms. Stratford, who had gone on to a better-paying job in another state\"Miss Fellowes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whirled, hoping it was Mandy Terris at last. But no, it was just Dr. Hoskins\u0027 secretary, bringingjerry Hoskins for his scheduled playtime with Timmie. The woman dropped Jerry off and hurried away. She, too, was rushing for a good place from which to watch the climax of Project Middle Ages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerry sidled toward Miss Fellowes, looking embarrassed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Fellowes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it, Jerry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy took a ragged news-strip cutting from his pocket and held it out to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a picture of Timmie, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Fellows glanced at it quickly. It was Timmie, all right, grinning out from the page. The excitement over Project Middle Ages had brought about a pale revival of interest in Timmie on the part of the press. The newsstrip picture was a photo that had been taken not long ago, on the third anniversary of his arrival. Timmie\u0027s birthday party, they had called it-celebrating his \"birth\" into the twenty-first century, a few of the scientists and a few reporters and Jerry and Timmie. Timmie was holding one of his \"birthday\" presents, a shining robot toy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about it?\" Miss Fellowes asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerry watched her narrowly. \"It says Timmie is an ape-boy. They aren\u0027t supposed to say that, are they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snatched the clipping from young Hoskins\u0027 hand and stared at it. There was 3 caption that she had not bothered to read before:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePREHISTORIC APE-BOY GETS TOY ROBOT FOR HIS BIRTHDAY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApe-boy, Ape-boy, Prehistoric ape-boy. Miss Fellowes\u0027 eyes brimmed with hot tears of rage. With a vicious twist of the wrist, she tore the news-strip into a dozen pieces and threw them on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why\u0027d you do that, Miss Fellowes? Because it said Timmie was an ape-boy? He isn\u0027t an ape-boy, is he? Or is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe caught the youngster\u0027s wrist and repressed the impulse to shake him. \"No, he isn\u0027t an ape-boy! And I don\u0027t want you ever to say those words again. Never, do you understand? It\u0027s a nasty thing to say and you mustn\u0027t do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerry struggled out of her grip, looking frightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart was pounding. Miss Fellowes fought to get control of herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go inside and play with Timmie,\" she said. \"He\u0027s got a new book to show you.\" \"You hurt me.\" \"I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to.\" \"I\u0027ll tell my fa-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go inside! Quick! I told you I was sorry.\" The boy scurried away, through the door of the bubble, turning once to look back at her with anger in his eyes. Miss Fellowes heard footsteps from the other direction and turned to see Mandy Terris approaching. About time, she thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a little late, aren\u0027t you?\" she said, trying to keep querulousness out of her voice. \"Jerry Hoskins is here already. Inside, playing with Timmie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, Miss Fellowes. I was trying to hurry, but there are crowds everywhere. There\u0027s just so much excitement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. Now, I want you-\" Mandy said, \"I guess you\u0027re in a rush to go off and watch, aren\u0027t you?\" Her thin, vacuously pretty face filled with envy. \"Of all times for me to have to be on duty-\" \"You can watch it on the evening news,\" Miss Fellowes said curtly. \"Let\u0027s go inside, shall we?\" It would be the first time she had left Mandy Terris alone with Timmie. \"The boys won\u0027t give you any trouble. They\u0027ve got milk handy and all the toys they\u0027ll need. In fact, it\u0027ll be better if you leave them alone as much as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand. And I\u0027ll be sure not to let him get out, either. I know how important that is.\" \"Good. Now come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Fellowes opened the Stasis door for her and showed her in. Timmie and Jerry were busy with their games in the back room and paid no attention. She showed Mandy Terris what needed to be done in the next couple of hours, the requisition forms to fill out, the record-keeping. v\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Miss Fellowes was about to leave, the girl called after her, \"I hope you get a good seat! And, golly, I sure hope it works!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Fellowes did not trust herself to make a reasonable response. She hurried on without looking back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the delay meant that she did not get a good seat. She got no nearer than the wall-viewing-plate in the assembly hall. She regretted that bitterly. If only she could have been on the spot; if she could somehow have reached out for some sensitive portion of the instrumentation; if she were in some way able to sabotage the experimentNo. That was madness. She summoned her strength and beat the foolish ideas back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimple destruction would accomplish nothing. They would simply rebuild and reconstruct and make the effort again. And she would have cut herself off from Timmie forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing would help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing but the failure of the experiment itself-its irretrievable breakdown, its fundamental impossibility- something of that sort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she waited through the countdown, watching every move on the giant screen, scanning the faces of the technicians as the focus shifted from one to the other, watching for the look of worry and uncertainty that would tell her that something had unexpectedly gone wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWatching-watchingNobody looked uncertain. No one seemed particularly worried. They had tested the equipment many times. They had run a thousand simulations; they had already satisfied themselves that a close-range temporal fix was feasible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe count ran all the way out, down to zero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd-very quietly, very unspectacularly-the experiment succeeded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the new Stasis that had been established there stood a bearded, stoop-shouldered peasant of indeterminate age, in ragged dirty clothing and wooden shoes, staring in dull horror at the sudden mad change that had flung itself over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd while the world went mad with jubilation, Miss Fellowes stood frozen in sorrow, jostled and pushed, all but trampled. Surrounded on all sides by triumph while she herself was bowed down with defeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the loudspeaker began to call her name with strident force, it sounded three times before she reacted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Fellowes. Miss Fellowes. You are wanted in Stasis Section One immediately. Miss Fellowes. Miss Fell-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat had happened?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me through!\" she cried, while the loudspeaker continued its repetitions without pause. With wild energy she cut a path for herself through the crowds, beating at the people in her way, striking out with closed fists, flailing desperately, moving toward the door in a nightmare slowness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Fellowes, please-Miss Fellowes-urgent-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e53\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandy Terris was in tears in the corridor outside the bubble. \"I don\u0027t know how it happened. I just went down to the edge of the corridor to watch a pocket view-ing-plate they had set up. Just for a minute. And then before I could move or do anything-\" She cried out in sudden accusation, \"You said they wouldn\u0027t make any trouble; you said I should leave them alone-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Fellowes, disheveled and trembling uncontrollably, glared at her. \"Where\u0027s Timmie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortenson had appeared from somewhere and was swabbing the arm of a wailing Jerry with disinfectant. Elliott was there, too, preparing an anti-tetanus shot. There was a bright bloodstain on Jerry\u0027s clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He bit me, Miss Fellowes,\" Jerry screamed in rage. \"He bit me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Miss Fellowes looked right through him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you do with Timmie?\" she cried out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I locked him in the bathroom,\" Mandy Terris said. \"I just threw the little monster in there and barricaded it with some chairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Fellowes ran into the dollhouse, scarcely even noticing the ripple of disorientation as she entered Stasis. She pushed the chairs aside and fumbled at the bathroom door. It took an eternity to get it open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last. She looked down on the ugly little boy, cowering miserably in the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t whip me, Miss Fellowes,\" Timmie said huskily. His eyes were red. His lips were quivering. \"I didn\u0027t mean to hurt him. You aren\u0027t going to whip me, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Timmie, who told you about whips?\" She drew him to her, hugging him wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said tremulously, \"She did. The new one. She said you\u0027d hit me with a long whip, that you would hit me and hit me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was wicked to say that. You won\u0027t be whipped. -But what happened? What happened, Timmie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared up at her. His eyes looked enormous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a low voice he said, \"He called me an ape-boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said I wasn\u0027t a real boy. That he read it in the newspaper. He said I was just an animal.\" Timmie was fighting to hold back tears; and dien they came, a flood of them. His words grew indistinct as he snuffled, and yet she could make out every syllable all too clearly. \"He said he wasn\u0027t going to play with a monkey any more. I said I wasn\u0027t a monkey. I\u0027m not a monkey. I know what a monkey is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Timmie-Timmie-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said I was all funny-looking. He said I was horrible and ugly. He kept saying and saying and I bit him.\" They were both crying now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Fellowes said, amid sobs, \"It isn\u0027t true. You know that, Timmie. You\u0027re a real boy. You\u0027re a dear real boy and the best boy in the world. And no one, no one, will ever take you away from me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe went outside again. Elliott and Mortenson were still busding around, patching Jerry up. Mandy Terris was nowhere to be seen.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Fellowes said, \"Get that boy out of here. Take him to his father\u0027s office and finish whatever it is you need to do with him there. And if you see Ms. Terris, tell her she can pick up her paycheck and clear out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey nodded. They backed away from her as if she had begun to breathe fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned and went back inside, to Timmie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e54\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mind was made up, now. It had been very easy: the sudden awareness of what had to be done, die sudden resolve to do it right away, quickly, no hesitation possible. Maybe there were dangers in it that she didn\u0027t understand, but she had to take diat chance. If she didn\u0027t act at iall, Timmie would surely be sent back across time to die. If she did what she planned now to do, there was at least the hope that things would work out. On the one hand, the certainty of death-on the other, hope. An easy choice, that one. And there wasn\u0027t any time for considering and reconsidering, not now, not when Hoskins\u0027 own son had been mangled like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, it would have to be done this night, this night, while the celebration over the success of Project Middle Ages still had everyone distracted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wished she could call Bruce Mannheim to let him know. But she didn\u0027t dare risk it. The switchboard computers might have some kind of security program in them; they might listen in and report what she was intending to do. She would have to get in touch with him after it was done. Mannheim wouldn\u0027t mind being awakened in the small hours of the night, not for this. And then he could get to work doing his part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMidnight, she thought. That\u0027s the right time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere would be no problem about her leaving and coming back that late. She often went there at night, even on nights when she had decided to sleep at her own apartment and had already left for the day. The guard knew her well and wouldn\u0027t dream of questioning her. He wouldn\u0027t think twice about why she happened to be carrying a suitcase, either. She rehearsed the noncommital phrase, \"Some games for the boy,\" and the calm smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGames for the boy? Bringing them in at midnight?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut why should anyone doubt her? She lived only for Timmie. Everyone around here knew that. If she was bringing games for him in the middle of the night, well, that was the way she was. Why should he take any notice?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evening, Miss Fellowes. Big day today, wasn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very big, yes. -Some games for the boy,\" she said, waving the suitcase and smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd went on past the security barrier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimmie was still awake when she entered the doll-house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Fellowes-Miss Fellowes-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe maintained a desperate pretense of normality to avoid frightening him. Had he been sleeping? A little, he said. He had had the dream again, and it had awakened him. So she sat with him for a rime, talking about his dreams with him, and listened to him ask wistfully about Jerry. She was as patient as she could force herself to be. There\u0027s no hurry, she told herself. Why should anyone be suspicious? I have every right to be in here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there would be few to see her when she left, no one to question the bundle she would be carrying. Timmie would be very quiet and then the thing would be done. It would be done and what would be the use of trying to undo it? They would let her be. They would let them both be. Even if what she was about to do blew every power line in six counties, there\u0027d be no point afterward in bringing Timmie back to his place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened the suitcase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took out die overcoat, the woolen cap with the ear-flaps, and the rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimmie said, with a note of bewilderment and perhaps distress in his voice, \"Why are you putting all these clothes on me, Miss Fellowes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said, \"I\u0027m going to take you outside, Timmie. To where your dreams are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dreams?\" His face twisted in sudden yearning, yet fear was there, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t need to be afraid. You\u0027ll be with me. You won\u0027t be afraid if you\u0027re with me, will you, Timmie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Miss Fellowes.\" He buried his little misshapen head against her side, and under her enclosing arm she could feel his small heart thud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lifted him into her arms. She disconnected the alarm and opened the door softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd screamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGerald Hoskins was standing there, facing her across the open door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e55\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were two men with Hoskins and he stared at her, looking as astonished as she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Fellowes recovered first by a second, and made a quick attempt to push past him into the corridor; but even with the second\u0027s delay Hoskins had enough time to stop her. He caught her roughly and hurled her back through the door of the bubble and up against a chest of drawers. Then he waved the other two men in and confronted her, blocking the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t expect this. Are you completely insane?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Fellowes had managed to interpose her shoulder so that it, rather than Timmie, had struck the chest. Now she turned, clinging to Timmie tightly and glaring defiantly at Hoskins. But the defiance went out of her as she began to speak. In a pleading tone, she said, \"What harm can it do if I take him, Dr. Hoskins? You can\u0027t put something like an energy loss ahead of a human life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoskins nodded to the others, and they stepped in alongside her, looking ready to restrain her if it turned out to be necessary. Hoskins himself reached forward and took Timmie out of her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"A power surge of the size that doing what you were about to do would black out an immense area. It would cripple the whole city all the next day. Computers would be down, alarms wouldn\u0027t function, data would be lost, all kinds of trouble. There\u0027d be a thousand lawsuits and we\u0027d be on the receiving end of all of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe costs would run into the millions for us. Way up in the millions. We might even find ourselves facing bankruptcy. At the very minimum it would mean a terrible financial setback for Stasis Technologies, and a colossal public-relations fiasco. Imagine what people will say when they find out that all that trouble was caused by a sentimental nurse acting irrationally for the sake of an ape-boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ape-boy!\" said Miss Fellowes, in helpless fury. \"You know that that\u0027s what the reporters like to call him,\" said Hoskins. \"And ordinary people all think of him that way. They still don\u0027t understand what a Neanderthal actually is. And I don\u0027t think they ever will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the other men had gone out of the bubble. He returned now, looping a nylon rope through eyelets along the upper portion of the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiss Fellowes gasped. She remembered the rope attached to the pull-lever outside the room containing Professor Adamewski\u0027s rock specimen so long ago. She cried out, \"No! You mustn\u0027t!\" But Hoskins put Timmie down and gently removed the overcoat he was wearing. \"You stay here, Timmie. Nothing will happen to you. We\u0027re just going outside for a moment. All right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimmie, white-faced and wordless, managed to nod. Hoskins steered Miss Fellowes out of the dollhouse ahead of himself. For the moment she was beyond resistance. Dully she noticed the red-handled pull-lever being adjusted in the hallway outside. Odd how she had never paid attention to it before, never let it enter her consciousness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sword of the executioner, she thought. \"I\u0027m sorry, Miss Fellowes,\" Hoskins said. \"I would have spared you this if I could. I planned it for midnight so that you\u0027d find out only when it was over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said in a weary whisper, \"You\u0027re doing this because your son was hurt. Don\u0027t you realize that jerry tormented this child into striking out at him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This has nothing to do with what happened to Jerry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure it doesn\u0027t,\" Miss Fellowes said acidly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Believe me. I understand about the incident today and I know it was Jerry\u0027s fault. -Well, I suppose what happened today has speeded things up a little. The story has leaked out. No way that it wouldn\u0027t have, with the media crawling all over the lab today because of Project Middle Ages. And we\u0027ll be hearing stuff about \u0027negligence,\u0027 \u0027savage Neanderthalers,\u0027 all that nonsense, getting into the news, spoiling the coverage of today\u0027s successful experiment. Better to end the Timmie experiment right here and now. Timmie would have had to leave soon anyway. Better to send him back tonight and give the sensationalists as small a peg as possible on which they can hang their trash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not like sending a rock back. He\u0027s a human being, and you\u0027ll be killing him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not killing. We\u0027ve got no reason to think that the return trip is harmful. He\u0027ll arrive more or less in the same place we took him from, at a point in time that we calculate will be roughly ten weeks after his departure- plus or minus a couple of weeks, factoring in entropic drift and other little technicalities. And he won\u0027t feel a thing. He\u0027ll be back home-a Neanderthal boy in a Neanderthal world. He won\u0027t be a prisoner and an alien any more. He\u0027ll have a chance at a free life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What chance? He\u0027s seven years old at best, accustomed to be taken care of, fed, clothed, sheltered. Now he\u0027ll be alone in an ice age. Don\u0027t you think his tribe may have wandered off somewhere else in ten weeks* time? They don\u0027t simply sit still-they follow the game, they move along the trail. And even if by some miracle they were still there, do you think they\u0027ll recognize him? Three years older in ten weeks? They\u0027d run screaming away. He\u0027d be alone and he\u0027d have to look after himself. How will he know how to do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoskins shook his head. His expression was bleak, stony, implacable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll find his tribe again, and they\u0027ll take him in and welcome him back. I\u0027m completely certain of it. Trust me, Miss Fellowes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him in anguish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trust you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please,\" he said, and suddenly there was anguish in his eyes too. \"There\u0027s no way around this. I\u0027m sorry, Miss Fellowes. Believe me, I am-sorrier than you\u0027ll ever give me credit for. But the boy has to go, and that\u0027s all there is to it. Don\u0027t make it any harder for me than it already is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes were fixed on his. She stared steadily, in silence, for a long terrible moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last she said, sadly, \"Well, then. At least let me say goodbye to him. Give me five minutes alone with him. You can let me have that, can\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHoskins hesitated. Then he nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go ahead,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e56\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimmie ran to her. For the last time he ran to her and for the last time Miss Fellowes clasped him in her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, she hugged him blindly. She caught at a chair with the toe of one foot, moved it against the wall, set it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be afraid, Timmie.\" ^\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not afraid if you\u0027re here, Miss Fellowes. -Is that man mad at me, the man out there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, he isn\u0027t. He just doesn\u0027t understand about us. -Timmie, do you know what a mother is?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like Jerry\u0027s mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well-yes. Like Jerry\u0027s mother. Do you know what a mother does?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A mother is a lady who takes care of you and who\u0027s very nice to you and who does good things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. That\u0027s what a mother does. Have you ever wanted a mother, Timmie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTimmie pulled his head away from her so that he could look into her face. Slowly, he put his hand to her cheek and hair and stroked her, just as long, long ago she had stroked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Aren\u0027t you my mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Timmie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you angry because I said that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Of course not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I know your name is Miss Fellowes, but- but sometimes, I call you \u0027Mother\u0027 inside. The way Jerry does his mother, only he does it out loud. Is that all right, that I was calling you that inside?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. Yes, it\u0027s all right. And I won\u0027t leave you any more and nothing will hurt you. I\u0027ll be with you to care for you always. Call me Mother, so I can hear you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother,\" said Timmie contentedly, leaning his cheek against hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rose, and still holding him, stepped up on the chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe remembered what Hoskins had said, about objects that weren\u0027t anchored being swept along in time with the transit object. A lot of the things in the room were anchored; some were not. Such as the chair she was standing on. Well, so be it: the chair would go. That wasn\u0027t important. Other things might go, too. She didn\u0027t know which would be caught in the time field and which would not. She didn\u0027t care. It was no problem of hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" Hoskins shouted, from outside the bubble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. She clutched Timmie tightly and reached up with her free hand, and yanked with all her weight at the cord where it hung suspended between two eyelets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Stasis was punctured and the room was empty. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-ugly-little-boy/page-18.html","bookId":1746,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:18:09 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:18:09 AM"}
