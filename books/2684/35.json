Hello?\" Kyle shouts before the line goes dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmanda never made it to Palm Springs the next morning and when it\u0027s confirmed to Rain that Amanda never showed up the following afternoon this is taken for some reason as a bad sign and not something someone who has been described to me as \"crazy\" and \"really messed up\" and who Rain slapped across the face in the apartment on Orange Grove and who had read my palm in an airport lounge and who had an affair with Rip Millar, who was, in fact, a member of his \"pussy posse,\" would be prone to do. The first ominous news comes in early this evening: Mike and Kyle find Amanda\u0027s blue Jeep in a parking lot off Interstate 10 outside of Indio. All of her bags are gone, including the one with the twenty thousand dollars in cash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m listening patiently as Rain tries to give me a version of the story that\u0027s been edited carefully enough that I don\u0027t have to ask any questions and she says she shouldn\u0027t be telling me this at all but the need is apparently overwhelming even though she has erased the real fear of it as she tries to keep it together with Patron and a joint and assuring herself that Amanda will show up eventually. I keep telling Rain that maybe there was a mystery Amanda needed to solve. I tell Rain that maybe Amanda wanted the answer to something. The other thing that soothes Rain, besides the tequila and the dope and the Xanax I\u0027ve given her, is the callback for The Listeners that I arranged for next week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does Julian think?\" I ask when she\u0027s been silent too long. \"About Amanda?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe can\u0027t answer that question because Julian\u0027s name can\u0027t be mentioned between us anymore. I finish the drink I\u0027m holding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, maybe Rip\u0027s involved in this,\" I say, imitating a child investigating a crime. \"Isn\u0027t Rip f**king her too? He must be very worried as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRain just shrugs, ignoring me. \"Maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe he\u0027s worried or maybe he\u0027s f**king her or maybe he\u0027s involved in this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe says nothing, just stares out the window of my office, slumped on the chair while I sit behind my desk watching her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you think her disappearance is connected to Rip shouldn\u0027t you go to the police?\" I ask, my voice idle and detached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRain turns and looks at me like I\u0027m insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t care, do you?\" she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never told me what happened between you and Kelly Montrose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was nothing. Whatever anyone told you, it\u0027s not true.\" She turns back to the drink and finishes it. \"Nothing ever happened between me and Kelly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe you,\" I say, swiveling slowly back and forth in my chair, planning how this scene will play out. \"You must have promised him something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not everyone\u0027s like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe Kelly wanted something to happen,\" she finally admits. \"Maybe that\u0027s why he made the call for me. I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And maybe that explains why Rip got so angry,\" I say, trying to remain calm, trying to rein in my excitement. \"Maybe he felt Kelly was about to make a move on you ... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Rip Millar is just ... very f**ked up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe that\u0027s why the two of you got along so well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you seriously talking to me like this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You knew something that day,\" I tell her. \"You knew that something had happened to Kelly. The day before you left for San Diego with that piece of shit. Kelly hadn\u0027t been found yet, but you knew that Rip had done something - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck off,\" she screams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t really care anymore,\" I finally say, moving toward her, stroking her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really don\u0027t care, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know her, Rain.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you know me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean in to kiss her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turns away. \"I don\u0027t want to,\" she mutters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then get out of here,\" I say. \"I don\u0027t care if you ever come back here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amanda\u0027s missing and you\u0027re - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said I don\u0027t care.\" I take her hand. I start pulling her toward the bedroom. \"Come on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just let it go, Clay.\" Her eyes are closed and she\u0027s grimacing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re not going to do this, then you should leave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if I leave, what will happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll make a call to Mark. I\u0027ll make another call to Jon. I\u0027ll call Jason.\" I pause. \"And I\u0027ll cancel everything.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-35.html","bookId":2684,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:48 AM"}
