IDA GREYSON\u0027S PARTY.","content":"\u0026nbsp;When Dick and his friend reached Mr. Greyson\u0027s house, two carriages stood before the door, from each of which descended young guests, who, like themselves, had been invited to the party. One of these brought two young girls of twelve, the other two boys of twelve and fourteen, and their sister of ten. Entering with this party, the two boys felt less embarrassed than if they had been alone. The door was opened by a servant, who said, \"Young ladies\u0027 dressing-room, second floor, left-hand room.

Still his new friend\u0027s proposal made Dick feel a little nervous. He was not bashful with boys, but he had very little acquaintance with girls or young ladies, and expected to feel ill at ease with them. Still he could not think of a good reason for excusing himself from the promised introduction, and, after going up to Ida in company with his new friend, and congratulating her on her birthday (he would not have known how to act if Theodore had not set him an example), he walked across the room to where one of the young ladies who had entered at the time he did was seated.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Alice,\" said Theodore, \"this is my friend Mr. Hunter, who would like to dance with you in the first Lancers.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Dick bowed, and Alice, producing a card, said, \"I shall be most happy.

Dick felt a little flustered, but determined to do his best.
