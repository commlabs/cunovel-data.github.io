His timing couldn\u0027t have been worse. The remaining members of the Tribunal couldn\u0027t take the risk of Caine finding the pirate\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand having a talk with him. So Caine had inadvertently put himself in danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t inadvertent,\" Caine interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"Colin had made Pagan promise not to tell Caine anything. His brother knew Caine\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewould . . . charge right in, you see, and Colin wanted to explain everything. In truth, I do believe Colin wasn\u0027t thinking the thing through, but he was in terrible pain at the time and he seemed obsessed with protecting Caine. Pagan agreed, just to placate Colin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And where do you fit into this scheme?\" Lyon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nathan is my brother,\" Jade answered. \"I returned to England and went to stay at his country estate. There were several of Pagan\u0027s men with me. They took turns watching out for Caine. Several attempts were made to get him, and it was then decided that I would find a way to get Caine away from his hunt. Two days before I was supposed to leave, a series of incidents took place. On the first morning, when I was taking my usual walk, I came upon three men digging up my parents\u0027 graves. I shouted, for I was in a rage, you see, over what they were doing. I drew their notice, of course. One of the villains shot at me. I ran back to Nathan\u0027s house to get help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Weren\u0027t Pagan\u0027s men still guarding you?\" Richards asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade shook her head. \"They were all needed to keep Caine safe. Besides, I had Nathan\u0027s butler, Hudson, and the other servants to assist me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then what happened?\" Lyon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was too dark for the servants to go to the graves. It was decided to wait until morning. That night, the house was pillaged,\" she continued. \"I slept through, however, and never heard a sound. Even my bedchamber was turned upside down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must have been drugged,\" Richards announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t imagine how it was done if I was drugged,\" Jade said. \"The following morning, I rode one of Nathan\u0027s mounts back to the graves to see if any evidence had been left. Nathan\u0027s butler, Hudson, was having a difficult time believing me, you see, and I wanted to convince him. As it turned out, I never made it to the graves. The villains were obviously waiting to intercept me. They killed Nathan\u0027s horse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went flying to the ground.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good Lord, you could have been killed by the fall,\" Richards said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was most fortunate, as I only sustained a few bruises,\" she explained. \"I went running back to the house, told Hudson what had happened. He sent men to chase after the villains. When they returned, they told me they couldn\u0027t find any evidence of foul play. The horse had vanished. I\u0027m not certain how that was accomplished. Caine said it would take more than three men to lift it into a wagon and cart it away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe paused to shrug, then continued. \"1 decided to go to London with all possible haste and immediately ordered the carriage made ready. Yet, as soon as we\u0027d traveled down the first hill, the coachman shouted that there was a fire. We could see the smoke. I returned to the house just in time to witness the full fire. Poor Nathan\u0027s house was gutted to the ground. I then ordered Hudson and the other servants to go to Nathan\u0027s London residence, then once again set out for my own destination.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And where was that?\" Lyon asked. \"Were you also going to Nathan\u0027s town house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade smiled. \"No, I was going to a tavern called the Ne\u0027er Do Well. I had a plan, you see, to get Caine away from his hunt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyon nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"1 don\u0027t understand,\" Richards interjected. \"What exactly was this plan? Caine isn\u0027t one to be easily fooled, my dear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll explain it all later,\" Caine interjected. \"Let her finish with this now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the way to London, the carriage was waylaid. I was hit on the side of my head. The blow made\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eme sleep, and when I awakened, I found that the carriage had been torn apart. I was able to squeeze through the window after I\u0027d widened the frame with the heel of my boot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then?\" Richards asked-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I walked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All the way to London?\" Lyon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Jade answered. \"Not all the way. I was able to ... borrow a horse from a way station. It was unattended. The owner was probably inside having his supper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade finished her accounting a few minutes later. She never mentioned the fact that she was Pagan, and Caine assumed he would have to be the one to tell Sir Richards and Lyon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust what was her game? Lord, by the time she\u0027d finished her recitation, she was dabbing at the corners\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof her eyes with Richards\u0027 handkerchief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe director was obviously shaken by her explanation. He leaned back in his chair and shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know who the other members of the Tribunal are?\" Jade asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you knew Hammond, didn\u0027t you?\" she asked. \"I understood that the two of you started out together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, we started out together,\" Richards agreed. \"Yet after a number of years, my dear, we were each given a different division within the War Department. Hammond had so many young men under his direction back then. He ran his own section. I met quite a few eager young saviors, but certainly not all\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have several telling clues,\" Lyon interjected. \"It shouldn\u0027t take us long to find out the truth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The first letter was signed by a man named William. They hadn\u0027t been assigned their operative names yet. Hell, that\u0027s the most common name in England,\" Caine added. \"How many Williams work for the War Office?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade answered his question. \"Actually, there were only three in Hammond\u0027s files.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone turned to look at her. \"Pagan read the files,\" she whispered. She blushed, then added, \"It was necessary. There\u0027s William Pryors, William Terrance, and William Clayhill. All three worked for your department, Sir Richards. Two are still alive, though retired from duty, but William Terrance died four years ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re certain of these facts?\" Lyon asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did Pagan get to our files?\" Richards was obviously disconcerted. \"By God, no one can get through our security.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pagan did,\" Caine said. He took over the conversation then, explaining in more detail how the pirate\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad set out to protect him. He told them about Colin\u0027s and Nathan\u0027s near miss with the sharks, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he was finished, no one said a word for a long while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade was gripping her hands together. It wasn\u0027t a pretense now, but the memory of the sharks that made her so agitated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three eager young men, bent on saving the world,\" Richards whispered. \"But the lust for power\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebecame more important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade nodded agreement. \"Did you notice, sir, that the first letters were signed with the wording, \u0027for the good of England,\u0027 but as time went on, and they grew more and more bold, they changed the wording?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I noticed,\" Sir Richards muttered. \" \u0027For the good of the Tribunal\u0027 was how they signed their notes,\" he added. \"And that does say it all, doesn\u0027t it. There can be no misinterpretation here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her father was killed by the two others when he refused to go along with their plans, and then Hammond was murdered,\" Caine said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichards nodded. \"We must find the other two,\" he muttered. \"Lord, there\u0027s so much to take in.\" He let out a weary sigh, then said, \"Well, thank God Pagan seems to be on our side. When I think of all the damage he could do with those files, my blood runs cold.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Pagan\u0027s very honorable,\" Jade rushed out. \"Most thieves are, sir. You mustn\u0027t worry that the information will fall into the wrong hands.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did that bastard read my file?\" Lyon demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine didn\u0027t answer him. He didn\u0027t think there was any reason to share the truth with his friend. It would only upset him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The very fact that there were sharks in those waters,\" Richards whispered, changing the topic. \"Do you realize the courage it must have taken . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you finished your questions?\" Jade interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe director immediately reached out and patted her hands again. \"We\u0027ve exhausted you, haven\u0027t we, my dear? I can tell how distressing this is for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for your consideration,\" she whispered. She stood up and didn\u0027t protest at all when Richards embraced her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll find the culprits, I promise you,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade hid her hands in the folds of her gown, then walked over to Lyon. He immediately stood up. She leaned against him. \"Thank you, Lyon, for helping us. Please give my love to Christina. I cannot wait until I can visit with her again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned back to Richards and hugged him again. \"I forgot to thank you as well,\" she explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pulled away from the director, bowed, and turned to leave the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jade?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Caine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was all that about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned around to smile at him. \"You said a man\u0027s pride is very important, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You also said that when a man is manipulated or deceived, his pride suffers, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did say that.\" He leaned forward. \"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if others were also . . . fooled . . . friends who have earned their own legends and England\u0027s respect, then wouldn\u0027t the blow be less painful?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally understood. His wink was slow, his grin arrogant. \"I shall go and ask Colin and Nathan to join you now,\" Jade announced before she left the room. The door closed softly behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was she talking about?\" Richards asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A personal matter,\" Caine answered. He turned to Lyon then. \"Well? What do you think of her now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis friend refilled his goblet with more brandy before he answered. \"She\u0027s still damned beautiful,\" he said. \"But I\u0027m once again thinking she\u0027s awfully timid. Must come from being around you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine laughed. \"You\u0027re back to thinking she\u0027s timid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What am I missing, Caine?\" Lyon asked, genuinely perplexed. \"What\u0027s the jest you find so amusing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Put aside this talk about women,\" Richards ordered. \"Now, son, you must promise me something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir?\" Caine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you actually met this Pagan fellow?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When this is finished, you must find a way for me to meet him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine leaned back in his chair. Jade had been right. She had just given him his pride back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must meet Pagan,\" Sir Richards demanded again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine nodded. \"Sir Richards, you just did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Fifteen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jade, come back here.\" Caine shouted that order while his two friends were trying to absorb the news he\u0027d just given them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she didn\u0027t respond to his summons, Caine called for Sterns. The butler must have been standing right outside the door, for he immediately rushed inside the library. He bowed to his employer, a courtesy he never ever extended when they were alone, and then asked, \"You wished something, mi\u0027lord?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring Jade back here,\" Caine ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe she heard your bellow, mi\u0027lord,\" Sterns announced in that highbrow voice of his, \"She has declined the invitation to rejoin you, however. Was there something more you wanted?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCaine wanted to strangle Sterns, but he pushed the notion aside. \"Bring her to me. Drag her in here if\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou have to, but bring her to me. That\u0027s what I want, Sterns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe butler nodded, then left on his errand. Caine turned back to his friends. He lost some of his irritation when he saw Lyon\u0027s grin. His friend seemed to be taking the news of Pagan\u0027s identity much better than Sir Richards was. The director still looked quite stunned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell, Caine, I should have guessed,\" Lyon said. \"She was so timid ... yes, I should have known, all right. You aren\u0027t one to be attracted to... and Christina did say that I should look below the . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Son,\" Sir Richards interrupted Lyon\u0027s rambling. \"This isn\u0027t the time for jests. We\u0027ve a serious matter here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJade opened the door in the middle of Richards\u0027 protests. \"I was fetching Nathan and Colin for you, Caine. What is it you wanted?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give them back, Jade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice had the bite of a pistol shot in it. Jade pretended innocence. \"Whatever are you talking about?\" she asked. She pressed her hand to her bosom in mock fear and fluttered her eyelashes at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t at all impressed. \"You know damned good and well what I\u0027m talking about,\" he roared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give them back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caine, it isn\u0027t polite to raise your voice to me in front of visitors,\" she instructed. Her voice had risen\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ean octave. \"It\u0027s plain rude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They know who you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe marched over to the front of his desk and glared at him.
