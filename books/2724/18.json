I’m Eric,” he said, leaning against the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Um, hi,” I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So—Conrad didn’t say anything to you before he left?” Jeremiah interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He barely talks, period. He’s like an android.” Then he grinned at me. “Well, he talks to pretty girls.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt sick inside. What pretty girls? Jeremiah exhaled loudly and clasped his hands behind his head. Then he took out his phone and looked at it, as if there might be some answer there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat down on Conrad’s bed—navy sheets and navy comforter. It was unmade. Conrad always made his bed at the summer house. Hotel corners and everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo this was where he’d been living. This was his life now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t have a lot of things in his dorm room. No TV, no stereo, no pictures hanging up. Certainly none of me, but none even of Susannah or his dad. Just his computer, his clothes, some shoes, books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I was actually about to take off, dudes. Going to my parents’ country house. Will you guys just make sure the door is closed when you leave? And when you find C, tell him he owes me twenty bucks for the pizza.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No worries, man. I’ll tell him.” I could tell Jeremiah didn’t like Eric, the way his lips almost but didn’t quite form a smile when he said it. He sat down at Conrad’s desk, surveying the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone knocked on the door and Eric ambled over to open it. It was a girl, wearing a long-sleeved shirt and leggings and sunglasses on the top of her head. “Have you seen my sweater?” she asked him. She peered around him like she was looking for something. Someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid they date, I wondered? That was my first thought. My second thought was, I’m prettier than her . I was ashamed of myself for thinking it, but I couldn’t help it. The truth was, it didn’t matter who was prettier, her or me. He didn’t want me anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah jumped up. “Are you a friend of Con’s? Do you know where he went?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe eyed us curiously. I could tell she thought Jeremiah was cute, the way she tucked her hair behind her ears and took her sunglasses off. “Um, yeah. Hi. I’m Sophie. Who are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“His brother.” Jeremiah walked over and shook her hand. Even though he was stressed out, he took the time to check her out and give her one of his trademark smiles, which she lapped right up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, wow. You guys don’t even look alike?” Sophie was one of those people who ended her sentences with a question mark. I could already tell that if I knew her, I would hate her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, we get that a lot,” Jeremiah said. “Did Con say anything to you, Sophie?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe liked the way he called her by her name. She said, “I think he said he was going to the beach, to surf or something? He’s so crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah looked at me. The beach. He was at the summer house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Jeremiah called his dad, I sat on the edge of Conrad’s bed and pretended not to listen. He told Mr. Fisher that everything was fine, that Conrad was safe in Cousins. He did not mention that I was with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, “Dad, I’ll go get him, it’s no big deal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Fisher said something on his end, and Jeremiah said, “But Dad—” Then he looked over at me, and mouthed, Be right back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe headed into the hallway and shut the door behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter he was gone, I lay back onto Conrad’s bed and stared up at the ceiling. So this was where he slept every night. I’d known him all my life, but in some ways, he was still a mystery to me. A puzzle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got out of bed and went over to his desk. Gingerly, I opened the drawer and found a box of pens, some books, paper. Conrad was always careful with his things. I told myself I wasn’t spying . I was looking for proof. I was Belly Conklin, Girl Detective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found it in the second drawer. A robin’s egg blue Tiffany box stuffed way in the back. Even as I was opening it I knew it was wrong, but I couldn’t help myself. It was a little jewelry box, and there was a necklace inside, a pendant. I pulled it out and let it dangle. At first I thought it was a figure eight, and that maybe he was dating some girl who ice skated—and I decided I hated her, too. And then I took a closer look, and laid it horizontal in the palm of my hand. It wasn’t an eight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was infinity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was when I knew. It wasn’t for some girl who ice skated or for Sophie down the hall. It was for me. He’d bought it for me. Here was my proof. Proof that he really did care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad was good at math. Well, he was good at everything, but he was really good at math.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few weeks after we started talking on the phone, when it had become more routine but no less thrilling, I told him all about how much I hated trig and how badly I was doing in it already. Right away I felt guilty for bringing it up—there I was complaining about math when Susannah had cancer. My problems were so petty and juvenile, so high school compared to what Conrad was going through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry,” I’d said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For talking about my crappy trig grade when . . .” My voice trailed off. “When your mom’s sick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t apologize. You can say whatever you want to me.” He paused. “And Belly, my mom is getting better. She put on five pounds this month.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hopefulness in his voice, it made me feel so tender toward him I could have cried. I said, “Yeah, I heard that from my mom yesterday. That’s really good news.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So, okay then. So has your teacher taught you SOH-CAH-TOA yet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom then on, Conrad started helping me, all over the phone. At first I didn’t really pay attention, I just liked listening to his voice, listening to him explain things. But then he’d quiz me, and I hated to disappoint him. So began our tutoring sessions. The way my mother smirked at me when the phone rang at night, I knew she thought we were having some kind of romance, and I didn’t correct her. It was easier that way. And it made me feel good, people thinking we were a couple. I’ll admit it. I let them think it. I wanted them to. I knew that it wasn’t true, not yet, but it felt like it could be. One day. In the meantime, I had my own private math tutor and I really was starting to get the hang of trig. Conrad had a way of making impossible things make sense, and I never loved him more than during those school nights he spent with me on the phone, going over the same problems over and over, until finally, I understood too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah came back into the room, and I closed my fist around the necklace before he could see it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/it-s-not-summer-without-you-summer-2/page-18.html","bookId":2724,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:14:01 PM"}
