He tried to flag me down, shouted something, but I was on a mission. I didn\u0027t need any company while I kicked Cadotte\u0027s ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould I kill him? I wasn\u0027t sure. But I could beat him bloody. He\u0027d made me believe in love right along with the werewolves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d wondered why love had come along so soon. I\u0027d wondered why me? The answer was crystal clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d needed someone to love him fast, and what better patsy than a woman who\u0027d never been loved before? I must have been so easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy hands ached from clenching them on the steering wheel. I welcomed the pain. It made me forget the one in my chest, the bubbling agony in my belly, the burn of tears in my eyes and my throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d been such an idiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached the turnoff to his place and left my car next to his. The sun was almost down; the moon was not yet up. Usually all this woo-woo shit took place at midnight anyway. If so, I had plenty of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused at the edge of the clearing. Lights yellowed the window/panes of his cabin. Either he was home or he liked to waste electricity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI braced myself to cross the yard and walk inside. I didn\u0027t plan on knocking. I wasn\u0027t a complete moron. Or maybe I was. I took one step and someone grabbed me from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy rifle flew into the underbrush. Strong arms pinned mine to my side. I struggled, kicked backward, tried to flip my assailant over my shoulder. Nothing worked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath, and I smelled him. \"Will?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nuzzled my shoulder; then his mouth latched on to my neck and his teeth grazed my skin. I shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted his head; his breath brushed my hair. My body went limp with wanting him. I was pathetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd suddenly I was free. My hand went to my gun, but it was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spun around. Cadotte had my pistol. He\u0027d also managed to retrieve my rifle. He looked a little silly holding two guns while stark naked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, he wasn\u0027t completely naked. He wore the totem around his neck. I guess he wasn\u0027t going to deny stealing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to go home, Jessie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ha. I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please. I don\u0027t want you hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. \"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know about the ceremony. I know what you need to become the wolf god.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me? I\u0027m not going to become the wolf god.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what\u0027s that for?\" I pointed to the totem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying to stop it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I discovered a ritual.\" His hands clenched on the weapons. His gaze shifted behind me. His agitation was evident. \"It\u0027s too complicated to explain right now. I need to finish before the blue moon rises.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do I know you aren\u0027t raising the wolf god?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. \"You don\u0027t. You\u0027re going to have to trust me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think that I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurt flickered over his face and for a minute I felt bad. Then my gaze lowered to the totem, and I remembered one of Zee\u0027s favorite sayings that didn\u0027t involve a curse word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shame on me,\" I muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"Sarcastic to the end. That\u0027s my girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not your girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips tightened; his eyes narrowed. I\u0027d managed to annoy him, and that wasn\u0027t easy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have time to argue. Are you going to behave, or do I have to tie and gag you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no way I was going to let him tie and gag me, not even for fun. \"I\u0027ll behave.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grunted and took a wide berth around me, then headed for a cairn of rocks at the far side of the clearing. Since he had my guns, there wasn\u0027t a whole helluva lot I could do about it -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, according to Clyde he needed my blood to do the deed. When he came to get it, I\u0027d be ready.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat on the porch steps. Cadotte lit a fire in the center of the rocks. Sprinkled what appeared to be dirt on top, except the flame turned green, then purple, then blood-red. No dirt I\u0027d ever seen could do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t take my eyes from the fire, from him. The colors of the flames played over his skin. His muscles flexed and released -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;across his stomach, down his thighs, up his arms. He was so beautiful he made me yearn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began to chant in Ojibwe. The words ebbed and flowed, a beautiful song in a language I could not understand. As the fire burned higher, hotter, he danced around the stone circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe oddity of a naked man dancing in the forest snapped me out of my trance. I began to get nervous. I glanced at the eastern horizon, but the sky was still pink. Not a sliver of silver to be found.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sound in the brush to my right caught my attention. When I followed the rustle, I saw the wolf. \"Will!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe froze, followed my gaze, cursed. More wolves appeared, sliding from the underbrush all around us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least fifty of them ringed the clearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly Will was at my side, shoving me toward the door. Good idea, since the wolves had begun to advance. Legs stiff, hackles raised, they snarled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do they want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think?\" He tapped the totem, which still hung around his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe stumbled over each other and into the cabin. He slammed the door just as a heavy body thumped against it. My eyes went to the glass window just as Will slammed a wood shutter into place and flipped the lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help me!\" he shouted, running from window to window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t have to tell me twice. What little light was left in the sky was blotted out as we boarded up all the glass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d puzzled over the dual shutters. Now I thanked God for them. If Cadotte\u0027s cabin had only been equipped with outdoor storm protection we\u0027d be dead or foaming at the mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe windows shattered as the wolves tried to get in. The shutters shimmied, but they held.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell,\" Cadotte muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at him and found myself distracted again by all that smooth, perfect skin and those supple muscles. I turned my back. \"Can you put on some clothes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Oh, yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went into his room and returned, pulling a bright yellow T-shirt over his head. The top button of his jeans hung open, and I swallowed the urge to put my mouth against the strip of skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn\u0027t the time. There might never be a time again. That upset me more than it should. Cadotte had used me, lied to me, and I wanted him still. I loved him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shutter behind my head rattled. I flinched. \"Can I have my gun back?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to shoot me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you going to bite me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wiggled his brows. \"Maybe later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made an impatient sound and he sighed. \"I thought you loved me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what you wanted all along, wasn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe appeared confused. \"Of course I want you to love me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you need the blood of the one who loves you to become the wolf god.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t tell me you didn\u0027t know that!\" I shouted. \"Don\u0027t lie to me anymore, Will!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I\u0027ve been lying to you? That I told you I loved you... why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You made me love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis lips narrowed. \"No one has that power. Either you love me or you don\u0027t. I can\u0027t make you feel anything. No matter how much I might want you to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eternal sadness that had drawn me to him so many times before was back, but I wasn\u0027t going to let him seduce me again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stalked into the kitchen, shuffled through the minutiae on the counter. Found the bag of plastic and held it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConfusion pushed away the sadness in his eyes. \"Where did that come from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t play stupid with me. You stole this from the evidence room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me? If I went anywhere near the police station your boss would have a stroke. Someone planted that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spare me the O.J. delusion.\" I moved into the living room and picked up the book on Ojibwe ceremonies. \"What about this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about it? I\u0027ve had that book for years. It\u0027s useless without the page that\u0027s missing, which is why I ordered another one.\" He frowned. \"But it hasn\u0027t arrived. That\u0027s what I get for ordering a used copy off the Internet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t it convenient that the one page we need is missing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s weird, that\u0027s for sure. I picked that book up in a secondhand store, never even looked through it until last week when I found a page missing.\" He shook his head. \"You actually think I was trying to raise the wolf god?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what to think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those wolves attacked us both. Why would they go after me if I made them? If I were a werewolf, wouldn\u0027t I have changed? Like them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spread my hands and shook my head. I wasn\u0027t sure of anything anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crossed the room and I tensed. I didn\u0027t want him to touch me. I wasn\u0027t sure what I\u0027d do. Slug him or hold him -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;neither one appealed at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadotte handed me my pistol, shrugged when I lifted my gaze to his. \"If you want to shoot me, Jessie, go ahead. I\u0027m tired of trying to make you believe that what we have is special.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened my mouth to say... I\u0027m not sure what, and my cell phone rang. It was Mandenauer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am waiting for you, Jessie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be waiting quite a while. I\u0027m a little... trapped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cadotte\u0027s place.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will be right there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring a lot of ammo. There are at least fifty of them out there. And... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fifty is nothing to me, Liebchen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he was gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadotte had moved to the other side of the room with my rifle. His back to me, the set of his shoulders was dejected. \"I didn\u0027t finish the ritual,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t let them get the totem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know that, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence descended, broken only by the intermittent thud of wolf bodies against the door and the windows. I wanted to ask him so many things, but he was right. I didn\u0027t trust him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGunshots sounded outside. Our eyes met. \"It\u0027s too soon to be Mandenauer,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadotte flipped the lock on the window in front of him and peeked out. \"It\u0027s the sheriff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe must have followed me here. Damn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI crossed the room and glanced outside. It was Clyde all right. He shot a few wolves. They whimpered, but they didn\u0027t die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lead bullets,\" I murmured. Clyde must not have had time to find any silver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shot his way through the circle, then backed toward the cabin. The wolves advanced again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI locked the shutter and hurried to let him in, taking my pistol along. I remembered how Clyde had tried to convince me that Will was the werewolf leader -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and I wasn\u0027t exactly unconvinced of that yet -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;but I wasn\u0027t going to let my boss kill him. I couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo as soon as I opened the door I asked for Clyde\u0027s gun. He froze, frowned, stared at the pistol trained on his chest. \"You nuts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hand it over, Clyde, or stay outside with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\" He slapped the weapon into my palm and stomped into the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think?\" His attention was captured by something behind me. \"You\u0027ve brainwashed her, you bastard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could stop him, Clyde charged Cadotte. They went down in a heap. Clyde was bigger, heavier, but Cadotte was younger and stronger. They rolled across the floor, banged into the furniture. Papers and books flew every which way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde yanked Cadotte\u0027s earring from his ear and tossed it across the room. The golden feather skittered into a heating vent. Damn, I\u0027d really liked that earring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood flowed down Cadotte\u0027s neck, a graphic illustration of the dangers of pierced ears -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;one reason I didn\u0027t have them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a step forward just as Cadotte hooked his leg around Clyde\u0027s and flipped the larger man onto his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blinked, and he had his knee on Clyde\u0027s chest, his forearm at his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aanizh��tam?\" he growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCadotte pressed harder, and Clyde turned purple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aanizh��tam?\" Cadotte repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClyde gave a sharp nod and Cadotte jumped up. He held out a hand, but Clyde smacked it away and clambered to his feet on his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood spattered across Cadotte\u0027s shirt and Clyde\u0027s. There were drops all over the floor. I resisted the urge to get a towel. This wasn\u0027t my house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is your problem?\" Cadotte asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This.\" Clyde reached out and yanked the totem from Will\u0027s neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill grabbed him by the shirt with both hands and lifted him off his feet. \"Give it back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth fell open. My boss had to weigh 300 pounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jessie!\" Clyde called. \"Don\u0027t you think I should hang on to the totem?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked back and forth between the two of them. I honestly didn\u0027t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother volley of shots sounded from outside. This time they were followed by surprised yips and agonized howls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let him go, Will,\" I ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandenauer pounded on the front door and shouted my name. I didn\u0027t have time for these games. I cocked the gun. Will\u0027s gaze flicked to mine. He shrugged and let Clyde go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Play nice,\" I admonished, and let the old man inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was wearing his Rambo outfit again -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;commando chic, with a whole lot of bullets. I couldn\u0027t conjure up a snappy retort. I was too damn glad to see him -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;and his ammo, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could grab a bandolier for myself, Manden-auer stalked past me and into the living room. The expression on his face made me hurry to keep up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which one of you is wolf clan?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A member of the wolf clan must take part in the ceremony.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI flicked a glance at Will. \"Did you know this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let my breath out on a long, slow sigh of disappointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Before you get all bent out of shape, I\u0027d like to point out something.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s wolf clan, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy head jerked up. Will was pointing at Clyde.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what? Nobody holds with that stuff anymore. Except for him.\" He jerked his head at Will. \"Most people don\u0027t even know what clan they are these days. Don\u0027t you find it interesting that he does?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandenauer drew his revolver and pointed it at Will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey!\" I grabbed his arm just as he fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTraining took over and I cracked his wrist over my knee. The gun fell to the floor. I kicked the rifle out of his other hand, then pulled his arms behind his back. He didn\u0027t fight me. Instead he stared at Will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerrified, I followed the direction of his gaze. There was a neat hole in the fleshy part of Will\u0027s arm. He was a mess, but he was alive, which also made him human. I could breathe again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tightened my grip on Mandenauer. \"What the hell are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Proving that he is not one of them. And quite nicely, don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Will snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pressed a hand to the hole, but blood seeped through his fingers. Black dots danced in front of my eyes. Since when had the sight of blood bothered me? Since it was his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandenauer had just proved Will wasn\u0027t a werewolf. The knowledge wasn\u0027t as comforting as it should have been. We still didn\u0027t know who was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMandenauer tugged on his hands, which I still held behind his back. \"Give me back my guns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then shoot the other so we know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Clyde. He frowned and shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t there a less bloody way to go about this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have never found one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was at a loss. I wanted to bandage Will\u0027s arm, but I couldn\u0027t leave Mandenauer alone. I couldn\u0027t hold on to all the guns myself. I couldn\u0027t bring myself to shoot Clyde and be done with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chorus of howls rose in the yard. Others joined in, louder and louder, until I wanted to put my hands over my ears to blot out the sound. But I couldn\u0027t do that, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt last the noise stopped. The resulting silence seemed to echo with their cries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many are out there?\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There were more than seventy when I arrived,\" Mandenauer answered. \"Probably well past a hundred by now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That can\u0027t be right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What part of \u0027 werewolf army\u0027did you not understand, Jessie?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dumped Mandenauer\u0027s guns on the couch, holstered my pistol, and took him with me to the front window. I unlatched the shutter. We stared at what appeared to be a sea of wolves in the yard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are they here for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice wasn\u0027t Mandenauer\u0027s; it was Clyde\u0027s. I glanced toward him just as he opened the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" I shouted, but the wolves didn\u0027t charge. Instead, they sat like dogs, tongues lolling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI released Mandenauer and ran, but I was too late. Clyde tossed the wolf totem high above the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll heads tilted up, then followed the stone back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore it met the ground a small ash-blond wolf leaped into the air and caught the rawhide between her teeth. She hit the ground running. The others followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could do nothing but stare at Clyde. His face bathed by the silver light of the rising moon, he began to sweat, to shake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo change. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-blue-moon-nightcreature-1/page-37.html","bookId":2088,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:37:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:37:08 PM"}
