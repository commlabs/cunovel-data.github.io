Adam started an investigation of ghetto schools, and headed a Senate committee that went to Moscow to meet with dissidents. There were newspaper photographs of his arrival at Sheremetyevo Airport, being greeted by unsmiling Russian officials. When Adam returned ten days later, the newspapers gave warm praise to the results of his trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coverage kept expanding. The public wanted to read about Adam Warner and the media fed their appetite. Adam became the spearhead for reform in the Senate. He headed a committee to investigate conditions in federal penitentiaries, and he visited prisons around the country. He talked to the inmates and guards and wardens, and when his committee\u0027s report was turned in, extensive reforms were begun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the news magazines, women\u0027s magazines ran articles about him. In Cosmopolitan, Jennifer saw a picture of Adam, Mary Beth and their little daughter, Samantha. Jennifer sat by the fireplace in her bedroom and looked at the picture for a long, long time. Mary Beth was smiling into the camera, exuding sweet, warm southern charm. The daughter was a miniature of her mother. Jennifer turned to the picture of Adam. He looked tired. There were small lines around his eyes that had not been there before, and his sideburns were beginning to be tinged with gray. For a moment, Jennifer had the illusion that she was seeing the face of Joshua, grown up. The resemblance was uncanny. The photographer had had Adam turn directly into the camera, and it seemed to Jennifer that he was looking at her. She tried to read the expression in his eyes, and she wondered whether he ever thought about her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJennifer turned to look again at the photograph of Mary Beth and her daughter. Then she threw the magazine into the fireplace and watched it burn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam Warner sat at the head of his dinner table, entertaining Stewart Needham and half a dozen other guests. Mary Beth sat at the other end of the table, making small talk with a senator from Oklahoma and his bejeweled wife. Washington had been like a stimulant to Mary Beth. She was in her element here. Because of Adam\u0027s increasing importance, Mary Beth had become one of Washington\u0027s top hostesses and she reveled in that position. The social side of Washington bored Adam, and he was glad to leave it to Mary Beth. She handled it well and he was grateful to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In Washington,\" Stewart Needham was saying, \"more deals get made over dinner tables than in the hallowed halls of Congress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam looked around the table and wished that this evening were over. On the surface, everything was wonderful. Inside, everything was wrong. He was married to one woman and in love with another. He was locked into a marriage from which there was no escape. If Mary Beth had not become pregnant, Adam knew he would have gone ahead with the divorce. It was too late now; he was committed. Mary Beth had given him a beautiful little daughter and he loved her, but it was impossible to get Jennifer out of his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wife of the governor was speaking to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re so lucky, Adam. You have everything in the world a man could want, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam could not bring himself to answer. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/rage-of-angels/page-33.html","bookId":2357,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:07:00 AM"}
