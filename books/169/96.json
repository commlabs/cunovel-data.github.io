He\u0027s a broken man.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"He must have an assistant of some sort. Or let the old Chief Gardener do it.

Besides\"-Seldon hesitated-æ”–here are ringers among the gardeners. Trantorians. They\u0027re here, for some reason. I have the names of every one of them.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Have them taken into custody, then. Every last one of them. It\u0027s simple. Why are you making it so complex?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Because we don\u0027t know why they\u0027re here. Something\u0027s up. I don\u0027t see what twelve gardeners can do, but- No, let me rephrase that. I can see a dozen things they can do, but I don\u0027t know which one of those things they\u0027ve planned. We will, indeed, take them into custody, but I must know more about everything before it\u0027s done.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"We have to know enough to winkle out everyone in the conspiracy from top to bottom and we must know enough of what they\u0027re doing to be able to make the proper punishment stick. I don\u0027t want to get twelve men and women on what is essentially a misdemeanor charge. They\u0027ll plead desperation, the need for a job. They\u0027ll complain that it isn\u0027t fair for Trantorians to be excluded. They\u0027ll get plenty of sympathy and we\u0027ll be left looking like fools. We must give them a chance to convict themselves of more than that. Besides-\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; There was a long pause and Dors said wrathfully, \"Well, what\u0027s the new `besides\u0027?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon\u0027s voice lowered. \"One of the twelve is Raych, using the alias Planchet.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"What?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"Why are you surprised? I sent him to Wye to infiltrate the Joranumite movement and he\u0027s succeeded in infiltrating something. I have every faith in him. If he\u0027s there, he knows why he\u0027s there and he must have some sort of plan to put a spoke in the wheel. But I want to be there, too. I want to see him. I want to be in a position to help him if I can.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"If you want to help him, have fifty guards of the Palace standing shoulder to shoulder on either side of your gardeners.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"No. Again, we\u0027ll end up with nothing. The Imperial Guard will be in place but not in evidence. The gardeners in question must think they have a clear hand to do whatever it is they plan to do. Before they can do so, but after they have made it quite plain what they intend-we\u0027ll have them.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \"That\u0027s risky.

I don\u0027t want their plan aborted.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; He paused, then said softly, \"Dors, you say your job is to protect me. That comes before protecting Raych and you know that. I wouldn\u0027t insist on it, but to protect me is to protect psychohistory and the entire human species. That must come first. What I have of psychohistory tells me that 1, in turn, must protect the center at all costs and that is what I am trying to do. -Do you understand?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Dors said, \"I understand,\" then turned away from him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Seldon thought: And I hope I\u0027m right.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; If he weren\u0027t, she would never forgive him.
