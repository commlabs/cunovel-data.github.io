{"id":24388,"no":28,"title":"XXV. THE PITIFUL.","content":"My friends, there hath arisen a satire on your friend: “Behold Zarathustra! Walketh he not amongst us as if amongst animals?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But it is better said in this wise: “The discerning one walketh amongst men AS amongst animals.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e How hath that happened unto him? Is it not because he hath had to be ashamed too oft?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e O my friends! Thus speaketh the discerning one: shame, shame, shame—that is the history of man!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And on that account doth the noble one enjoin upon himself not to abash: bashfulness doth he enjoin on himself in presence of all sufferers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Verily, I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too destitute are they of bashfulness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is preferably at a distance.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recognised: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path, and those with whom I MAY have hope and repast and honey in common!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Verily, I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Since humanity came into being, man hath enjoyed himself too little: that alone, my brethren, is our original sin!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best to give pain unto others, and to contrive pain.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Therefore do I wash the hand that hath helped the sufferer; therefore do I wipe also my soul.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For in seeing the sufferer suffering—thereof was I ashamed on account of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Great obligations do not make grateful, but revengeful; and when a small kindness is not forgotten, it becometh a gnawing worm.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!”—thus do I advise those who have naught to bestow.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I, however, am a bestower: willingly do I bestow as friend to friends. Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit from my tree: thus doth it cause less shame.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! Verily, it annoyeth one to give unto them, and it annoyeth one not to give unto them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the sting of conscience teacheth one to sting.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Verily, better to have done evilly than to have thought pettily!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To be sure, ye say: “The delight in petty evils spareth one many a great evil deed.” But here one should not wish to be sparing.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Like a boil is the evil deed: it itcheth and irritateth and breaketh forth—it speaketh honourably.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Behold, I am disease,” saith the evil deed: that is its honourableness.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But like infection is the petty thought: it creepeth and hideth, and wanteth to be nowhere—until the whole body is decayed and withered by the petty infection.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this word in the ear: “Better for thee to rear up thy devil! Even for thee there is still a path to greatness!”—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ah, my brethren! One knoweth a little too much about every one! And many a one becometh transparent to us, but still we can by no means penetrate him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him who doth not concern us at all.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e If, however, thou hast a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus wilt thou serve him best.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And if a friend doeth thee wrong, then say: “I forgive thee what thou hast done unto me; that thou hast done it unto THYSELF, however—how could I forgive that!”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thus speaketh all great love: it surpasseth even forgiveness and pity.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e One should hold fast one’s heart; for when one letteth it go, how quickly doth one’s head run away!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ah, where in the world have there been greater follies than with the pitiful? And what in the world hath caused more suffering than the follies of the pitiful?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Woe unto all loving ones who have not an elevation which is above their pity!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Thus spake the devil unto me, once on a time: “Even God hath his hell: it is his love for man.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And lately, did I hear him say these words: “God is dead: of his pity for man hath God died.”—\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e So be ye warned against pity: FROM THENCE there yet cometh unto men a heavy cloud! Verily, I understand weather-signs!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it seeketh—to create what is loved!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Myself do I offer unto my love, AND MY NEIGHBOUR AS MYSELF”—such is the language of all creators.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e All creators, however, are hard.—\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2158/61040.html","bookId":445,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 2:08:22 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 2:08:22 PM"}
