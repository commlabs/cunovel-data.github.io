MUTINY.","content":"In a short time after, the orderly rapped at the door, and on being told to enter, announced:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Please, colonel, the adjutant says as how he wants to know ef he’s released from arrest?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Did he dare to ask you that?” inquired Clark, sharply; and as he spoke his eye flashed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Please, sir, they wouldn’t let me see him,” said the man.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Who wouldn’t let you see him?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The commander was growing very angry, for he was a strict disciplinarian, and this sounded terrible in his ears.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The orderly hesitated.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Speak quick, man! Who wouldn’t let you see him?”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Colonel,” said the rough borderer, who was, after all, only a half disciplined, independent militia-man; “’tain’t my fault, honest; but them Injuns and the young lady was at the door, and the young lady she guv me the message from adjutant; and please, colonel, the boys are all in a crowd around the door, and they cheered her when she spoke, and it’s my belief, sir—”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “That will do,” said Clark, imperiously. “I understand you. There’s mutiny afoot, and you’re afraid. Out of the way.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Before father Gibault could interfere to check him, the colonel was out of the room and half-way down-stairs. He[87] was in a state of the greatest excitement, and shouted for his horse in a manner strangely unlike his usual quiet way. Two minutes after, he was galloping down the street toward the camp, which, as before, was pitched in front of the disused arsenal occupied by the Indians.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Around the door, as the orderly had said, the whole of the motley force of borderers were clustered; and from the murmurs that reached his ear, it was evident that an unusual excitement was going on.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As the colonel galloped up, a dead silence fell on all; but not a man stirred out of his way, and matters looked quite squally, for the rough backwoodsmen made no scruple of looking with open defiance at their leader.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The tact of Clark was infinite, or he would not have been the successful leader that he was. He saw now that he had made a mistake, and pulled up his horse by the crowd, saying, quietly:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Stand out of my way, men. I want to enter that building.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He looked at the door of the arsenal, and there stood beautiful Ruby Roland, with her savage allies round her, stern and impassive, looking straight at him.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Not a man stirred out of his path. Some of them crowded closer in his way, and he saw that they all carried their rifles. For the first time in his life, Clark was at a loss what to do. The instinct of discipline impelled him to violence, but his experience of the reckless Kentuckians told him that such a step would be useless.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Moreover, Bowman and all his officers stood in a group at a fire near by, with their backs resolutely turned to the scene of disturbance. Clark was too intensely proud to call for assistance from them which he saw they were unwilling to grant. He was also too politic to precipitate a fight by attempting to ride into the crowd.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For fully a minute an ominous silence prevailed, and then Clark spoke to Ruby, in a clear, loud voice:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Mademoiselle, is my adjutant in your quarters? If so, I call on you, as my ally, to deliver him up to me.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Like a silver trumpet came back Ruby’s answer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “He is here. He shall not go forth till he is released from arrest, except to be tried by a court-martial.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [88]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Instantly a tremendous cheer burst from all the borderers, and Clark saw that he had not a friend left.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It was a bitter and humiliating thing for the proud leader, in the moment of his triumph over enemies; and Clark felt it keenly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e For one moment he looked reproachfully at Ruby, then on his rebellious men. There was something in his face that abashed the boldest there, for the anger had gone out of it entirely, and there was an expression of proud regret that seemed for the first time to suggest that there might be two sides to this question. Then the border leader put his hands to his holsters, drew forth his pistols, and cast them on the ground, amid a dead silence. He unbuckled his sword and held it up in his right hand, as he said:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “Mademoiselle, I see now who is my real enemy. God forgive you. Men, I never yet condescended to ask a favor of you. I have given you a new country. Keep it for yourselves. I am no longer your leader.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He threw down the sword as he spoke, and wheeled his horse. Slowly and sadly, but with head proudly erect, he rode up the street to the government house, passed it, and walked his horse through the principal street out into the open prairie.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The men had conquered their commander.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But never in this world did men seem so utterly unable to take advantage of a victory. They looked at each other in silence and dismay, as the consequences of their acts dawned upon them. Never was leader more beloved than Clark, and only the still greater affection which they entertained for their little adjutant, and their impression that he had been harshly treated by Clark, had induced them to rebel. In that delicious ignorance of martial law, so characteristic of the American border militiamen, they had never conceived that they were doing any thing wrong; only that they were giving their colonel a gentle hint to release their favorite officer. Now, when it was too late, they all seemed bewildered, and none more so than Ruby Roland. She stood at the top of the steps, gazing blankly after Clark, as if unable to comprehend why he had not yielded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Then, after the form of the colonel had gone almost out of[89] sight, arose a confused hubbub of voices, as the borderers broke up into groups, and excitedly discussed the position.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e As reverently as sacred relics, the weapons of their commander were lifted from the ground, and a large deputation besieged Major Bowman and the officers, to entreat the colonel to come back.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But to their great surprise, Bowman and the others were dead against them. The fact was that every one saw that they had made a mistake, and these very officers were mean enough to cast the blame off from their own shoulders, no matter where it lighted. Major Bowman was, in fact, the very meanest of all, for he threw off his sword and belt, saying:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “No, no, boys. I take no responsibility. You chose to listen to that gal over yonder, and now she’ll have to get you out of the snarl. I’ve naught to do with it. I told you not to make such a fuss about that boy; that it would end in harm. I’ll take no command of a mob like this. Go to your lady friend.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And Big Bill Harrod was still more emphatic.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e “I tell yer, boys, that Frank’s the sassiest little cuss ever I seen, and a good whipping would do him good. Ef yer think he’s wuth more than cunnel, let him go; but ef yer don’t, jest yer go over to that thur young lady, and ax her to go arter the cunnel, and tell him as how ye made a mistake, and ax his pardon. I guess he won’t be hard on little Frank, ef she begs fur him, and it’s my notion that nary a man in this hyar camp kin fotch him back so quick as that thar gal.”\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The rough captain’s words were not without their effect on his audience, who involuntarily turned toward Ruby.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The girl was standing where she had been, but entirely deserted by the very men who, a moment before, had been cheering her. She seemed to realize that her brief reign of popularity was over, and that she too had made a mistake. As the soldiers timidly proffered their request, the august beauty yielded to it with grace, mounted her horse without a moment’s delay, and set off at full gallop after Clark, bearing the commander’s sword with her.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1982/56707.html","bookId":709,"creation":"Aug 3, 2019 3:47:52 PM","modification":"Aug 3, 2019 3:47:52 PM"}
