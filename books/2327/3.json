And just about everybody was heading for home, like baseball fans streaming out of Dodger Stadium in the seventh inning of a tie game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRichard Thurman was in the ring now, helping his cameraman pack up his gear. I didn\u0027t see the placard girl anywhere. I didn\u0027t see the father and son team from ringside, either, although I looked for them, thinking I\u0027d point them out to Chance and see if he recognized the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hell with it. Nobody was paying me to figure out why some doting father looked familiar. My job was to get a line on Richard Thurman, and to find out whether or not he had murdered his wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in November, Richard and Amanda Thurman had attended a small dinner party on Central Park West. They left the party shortly before midnight. It was a pleasant night; it had been unseasonably warm all week, so they elected to walk home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir apartment occupied the entire top floor of a five-story brownstone on West Fifty-second Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues. The ground floor housed an Italian restaurant, while a travel agent and a theatrical broker shared the second floor. The third and fourth floors were both residential. There were two apartments on the third floor, one housing a retired stage actress, the other a young stockbroker and a male model. The fourth floor held a single apartment; the tenants, a retired attorney and his wife, had flown to Florida on the first of the month and wouldn\u0027t be back until the first week in May.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the Thurmans got home, somewhere between twelve and twelve-thirty, they reached the fourth-floor landing just as a pair of burglars emerged from the attorney\u0027s empty apartment. The burglars, two large and muscular white males in their late twenties or early thirties, drew guns and herded the Thurmans into the apartment they had just ransacked. There they relieved Richard of his watch and wallet, took Amanda\u0027s jewelry, and told the two that they were a pair of worthless yuppies and they deserved to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey gave Richard Thurman a beating, tied him up and taped his mouth. Then they sexually assaulted his wife in front of him. Eventually one of them struck Richard over the head with what he believed was a crowbar or pry bar and he lost consciousness. When he came to the burglars were gone and his wife was lying on the floor across the room, nude and apparently unconscious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rolled off the bed onto the floor and tried kicking at the floor, but it was thickly carpeted and he couldn\u0027t make enough noise to attract the attention of the tenant in the apartment below. He knocked over a lamp but no one responded to the noise it made. He made his way over to where his wife was lying, hoping to arouse her, but she did not respond and did not appear to be breathing. Her skin felt cool to him and he was afraid that she was dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t free his hands and his mouth was still taped. It took some doing to loosen the tape. He tried shouting but no one responded. The windows were closed, of course, and the building was an old one, with thick walls and floors. He finally managed to upend a small table and knock a telephone down onto the floor. Also on the table was a metal tool that the attorney used to tamp down the tobacco in his pipe. Thurman gripped that between his teeth and used it to ring 911. He gave the operator his name and address and said he was afraid his wife was dead or dying. Then he passed out, and that\u0027s how the police found him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHAT was on the second weekend in November, Saturday night and Sunday morning. On the last Tuesday in January, I was sitting in Jimmy Armstrong\u0027s at two in the afternoon drinking a cup of coffee. Across the table from me sat a man about forty years old. He had short dark hair and a closely trimmed beard that was showing a little gray. He wore a brown tweed jacket over a beige turtleneck. He had an indoor complexion, no rare thing in the middle of a New York winter. His gaze, behind metal-framed eyeglasses, was thoughtful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think that bastard killed my sister,\" he said. The words were angry but the voice was cool, the inflection level and neutral. \"I think he murdered her and I think he\u0027s getting away with it, and I don\u0027t want that to happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArmstrong\u0027s is at the corner of Tenth and Fifty-seventh. It\u0027s been there a few years now, but before then it was on Ninth Avenue between Fifty-seventh and Fifty-eighth, in premises now occupied by a Chinese restaurant. In those days I just about lived in the place. My hotel was right around the corner, and I ate one or more meals a day there, met clients there, and spent most of my evenings at my usual table in the back, talking with people or brooding by myself, drinking my bourbon neat or on the rocks or, as an aid to staying awake, mixing it with coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I stopped drinking, Armstrong\u0027s was at the top of my unwritten list of people, places, and things to avoid. That became easier to do when Jimmy lost his lease and moved a block west, out of my usual daily traffic pattern. I didn\u0027t go there for a long time, and then a sober friend suggested we stop there for a late bite, and since then I\u0027ve probably had half a dozen meals there. They say it\u0027s a bad idea to hang out in ginmills when you\u0027re trying to stay sober, but Armstrong\u0027s felt more like a restaurant than a ginmill anyway, especially in its current incarnation with its exposed brick walls and potted ferns overhead. The background music was classical, and on weekend afternoons they had live trios playing chamber music. Not exactly your typical Hell\u0027s Kitchen bucket of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Lyman Warriner said he was down from Boston I suggested we meet at his hotel, but he was staying at a friend\u0027s apartment. My own hotel room is tiny, and my lobby is too shabby to inspire confidence. So once again I had picked Jimmy\u0027s saloon as a place to meet a prospective client. Now a baroque woodwind quintet played on the sound system while I drank coffee and Warriner sipped Earl Grey tea and accused Richard Thurman of murder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked him what the police had said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The case is open.\" He frowned. \"That would seem to suggest that they\u0027re working on it, but I gather it means the reverse, that they\u0027ve largely abandoned hope of solving it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not that cut-and-dried,\" I said. \"It usually means the investigation is no longer being actively pursued.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. \"I spoke to a Detective Joseph Durkin. I gather the two of you are friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re friendly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe arched an eyebrow. \"A nice distinction,\" he said. \"Detective Durkin didn\u0027t say that he thought Richard was responsible for Amanda\u0027s death, but it was the way he didn\u0027t say it, if you know what I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I asked him if he could think of anything I might do to help resolve the situation. He said that everything that could be done through official channels had been done. It took me a minute before I realized he couldn\u0027t specifically suggest I hire a private detective, but that was where he was leading me. I said, \u0027Perhaps someone unofficial, say a private detective- \u0027 and he grinned as if to say that I\u0027d caught on, that I was playing the game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He couldn\u0027t come right out and say it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Nor, I gather, could he come right out and recommend your services. \u0027As far as a recommendation\u0027s concerned, all I\u0027m really supposed to do is refer you to the Yellow Pages,\u0027 he said. \u0027Except I should say that there\u0027s one fellow right here in the neighborhood who you won\u0027t find in the book, on account of he\u0027s unlicensed, which makes him very unofficial.\u0027 You\u0027re smiling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do a good Joe Durkin imitation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. Pity there\u0027s not much call for it. Do you mind if I smoke?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure? Almost everyone\u0027s quit. I quit, but then I started again.\" He seemed about to elaborate on that, then took out a Marlboro and lit it. He drew in the smoke as if it were something life-sustaining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said, \"Detective Durkin said you were unorthodox, even eccentric.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were those his words?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll do. He said your rates are arbitrary and capricious, and no, those weren\u0027t his words either. He said you don\u0027t furnish detailed reports or keep track of expenses.\" He leaned forward. \"I can live with that. He also said when you get your teeth in something you don\u0027t let go, and that\u0027s what I want. If that son of a bitch killed Amanda I want to know it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What makes you think he did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A feeling. I don\u0027t suppose that\u0027s terribly scientific.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" He looked at his cigarette. \"I never liked him,\" he said. \"I tried to, because Amanda loved him, or was in love with him, or whatever you want to call it. But it\u0027s difficult to like someone who clearly dislikes you, or at least I found it difficult.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thurman disliked you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Immediately and automatically. I\u0027m gay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that\u0027s why he disliked you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He may have had other reasons, but my sexual orientation was enough to place me beyond the pale of his circle of potential friends. Have you ever seen Thurman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just his photo in the newspapers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t seem surprised when I told you I was gay. You knew right away, didn\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t say I knew. It seemed likely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the basis of my appearance. I\u0027m not setting traps for you, Matthew. Is it all right if I call you Matthew?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or do you prefer Matt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Either one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And call me Lyman. My point is that I look gay, whatever that means, although to people who haven\u0027t been around many homosexuals my own gayness, if you will, is probably a good deal less evident. Well. My take on Richard Thurman, based on his appearance, is that he\u0027s so deep in the closet he can\u0027t see over the coats.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meaning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Meaning I don\u0027t know that he\u0027s ever acted out, and he may very well not be consciously aware of it, but I think he prefers men. Sexually. And dislikes openly gay men because he fears we\u0027re sisters under the skin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE waitress came over and poured me more coffee. She asked Warriner if he wanted more hot water for his tea. He told her he would indeed like more hot water, and a fresh tea bag to go with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A pet peeve,\" he told me. \"Coffee drinkers get free refills. Tea drinkers get free hot water, but if you want another tea bag they charge you for a second cup. Tea costs them less than coffee anyway.\" He sighed. \"If I were a lawyer,\" he said, \"I might mount a class-action suit. I\u0027m joking, of course, but somewhere in our litigious society, someone is probably doing just that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t be surprised.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was pregnant, you know. Almost two months. She\u0027d been to the doctor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was in the papers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s my only sibling. So the bloodline dies out when I go. I keep thinking that should trouble me, but I don\u0027t know that it does. What does trouble me is the idea of Amanda dying at the hands of her husband, and of him getting away with it. And of not knowing for sure. If I knew for sure-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would trouble me less.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waitress brought his tea. He dunked the fresh tea bag. I asked him what might have motivated Thurman to kill Amanda.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Money,\" he said. \"She had some.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How much?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our father made a lot of money. In real estate. Mother found ways to piss away a good deal of it, but there was still some left when she died.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-dance-at-the-slaughter-house-matthew-scudder-9/page-3.html","bookId":2327,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:31 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:31 AM"}
