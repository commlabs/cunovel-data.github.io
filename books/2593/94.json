Evelyn catches me on call waiting while I\u0027m listening to messages on 976-TWAT and watching a tape on the VCR of this morning\u0027s Patty Winters Show which is about Deformed People.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Patrick?\" Evelyn asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pause, then in a dull monotone calmly announce, \"You have reached Patrick Bateman\u0027s number. He is unable to come to the phone right now. So please leave a message after the tone...\" I pause, then add, \"Have a nice day.\" I pause again, praying to god that she bought it, before emitting a pitiful \"Beep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh stop it, Patrick,\" she says irritably. \"I know it\u0027s you. What in god\u0027s name do you think you\u0027re doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hold the phone out in front of me then drop it on the floor and bang it against the nightstand. I keep pressing some of the numbers down, hoping that when I lift the receiver up to my ear I\u0027ll be greeted by a dial tone. \"Hello? Hello?\" I say. \"Is anyone there? Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh for god\u0027s sake stop it. Just stop it,\" Evelyn wails.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Evelyn,\" I say cheerily, my face twisted into a grimace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where have you been tonight?\" she asks. \"I thought we were supposed to have dinner. I thought we had reservations at Raw Space.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Evelyn,\" I sigh, suddenly very tired. \"We didn\u0027t. Why would you think that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought I had it written down,\" she whines. \"I thought my secretary had written it down for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, one of you was wrong,\" I say, rewinding the tape by remote control from my bed. \"Raw Space? Jesus. You... are... insane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey,\" she pouts. \"Where were you tonight? I hope you didn\u0027t go to Raw Space without me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh my god,\" I moan. \"I had to rent some videotapes. I mean I had to return some videos.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else did you do?\" she asks, still whining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I ran into Arthur Crystal and Kitty Martin,\" I say. \u0027They just had dinner at Cafe Luxembourg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh really?\" Chillingly, her interest perks up. \"What was Kitty wearing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An off-the-shoulder ball gown with velvet bodice and a floral-patterned lace skirt by Laura Marolakos, I think.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Arthur?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh Mr. Bateman.\" She giggles. \"I adore your sense of humor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, it\u0027s late. I\u0027m tired.\" I fake a yawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I wake you?\" she asks worriedly. \"I hope I didn\u0027t wake you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I say. \"You did. But I took your call so it\u0027s my fault, not yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dinner, honey? Tomorrow?\" she asks, coyly expecting an affirmative response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t. Work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You practically own that damn company,\" she moans. \"What work? What work do you do? I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evelyn,\" I sigh. \"Please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh Patrick, lets go away this summer,\" she says wistfully. \"Let\u0027s go to Edgartown or the Hamptons.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll do that,\" I say. \"Maybe I\u0027ll do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePaul Smith\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m standing in Paul Smith talking to Nancy and Charles Hamilton and their two-year-old daughter, Glenn. Charles is wearing a four-button double-breasted linen suit by Redaelli, a cotton broadcloth shirt by Ascot Chang, a patterned silk tie by Eugenio Venanzi and loafers by Brooks Brothers. Nancy is wearing a silk blouse with mother-of-pearl sequins and a silk chiffon skirt by Valentino and silver earrings by Reena Pachochi. I\u0027m wearing a six-button double-breasted chalk-striped wool suit and a patterned silk tie, both by Louis, Boston, and a cotton oxford cloth shirt by Luciano Barbera. Glenn is wearing silk Armani overalls and a tiny Mets cap. As the salesgirl rings up Charles\u0027s purchases, I\u0027m playing with the baby while Nancy holds her, offering Glenn my platinum American Express card, and she grabs at it excitedly, and I\u0027m shaking my head, talking in a high-pitched baby voice, squeezing her chin, waving the card in front of her face, cooing, \"Yes I\u0027m a total psychopathic murderer, oh yes I am, I like to kill people, oh yes I do, honey, little sweetie pie, yes I do...\" After the office today I played squash with Ricky Hendricks, then had drinks with Stephen Jenkins at Fluties and I\u0027m supposed to meet Bonnie Abbott for dinner at Pooncakes, the new Bishop Sullivan restaurant in Gramercy Park, at eight o\u0027clock.The Patty Winters Show this morning was about Concentration Camp Survivors. I take out a Sony Watchman Pocket TV (the FD-270) that has a 2.7-inch black-and-white miniscreen and weighs only thirteen ounces, and hold it out to Glenn. Nancy asks, \"How\u0027s the shad roe at Rafaeli\u0027s?\" Right now, outside this store, it\u0027s not dark yet but it is getting there. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-94.html","bookId":2593,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM"}
