She escaped with nothing worse than a concussion, a cracked rib, a broken wrist, and painful bruises. Jovan suffered a fractured leg and scrapes and bruises. Matt Baker had telephoned Dana that night and ordered her to return to Washington, but the incident had made Dana more determined than ever to stay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These people are desperate,\" Dana told him. \"I can\u0027t just walk away from this. If you order me home, then I quit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you blackmailing me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I thought,\" Matt snapped. \"I don\u0027t let anyone blackmail me. Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana waited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about a leave of absence?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t need a leave of absence.\" She could hear his sigh over the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. Stay there. But, Dana - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Promise me that you\u0027ll be careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom outside the hotel, Dana could hear the sound of machine-gun fire. \"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe city had been under heavy attack all night. Dana had been unable to sleep. Each explosion of a mortar landing meant another building destroyed, another family homeless, or worse, dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly in the morning, Dana and her crew were out on the street, ready to shoot. Benn Albertson waited for the thunder of a mortar to fade away, then nodded to Dana. \"Ten seconds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready,\" Dana said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenn pointed a finger, and Dana turned away from the ruins behind her and faced the television camera.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is a city that is slowly disappearing from the face of the earth. With its electricity cut off, its eyes have been put out... Its television and radio stations have been shut down, and it has no ears. ...All public transportation has come to a halt, so it has lost its legs...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe camera panned to show a deserted, bombed-out playground, with the rusty skeletons of swings and slides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In another life, children played here, and the sound of their laughter filled the air.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMortar fire could be heard again in the near distance. An air raid alarm suddenly sounded. The people walking the streets behind Dana continued as though they had heard nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The sound you\u0027re hearing is another air raid alarm. It\u0027s the signal for people to run and hide. But the citizens of Sarajevo have found that there is no place to hide, so they walk on in their own silence. Those who can, flee the country, and give up their apartments and all their possessions. Too many who stay, die. It\u0027s a cruel choice. There are rumors of peace. Too many rumors, too little peace. Will it come? And when? Will the children come out of their cellars and use this playground again one day? Nobody knows. They can only hope. This is Dana Evans reporting from Sarajevo for WTE.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red light on the camera blinked off. \"Let\u0027s get out of here,\" Benn said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndy Casarez, the new cameraman, hurriedly started to pack up his gear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA young boy was standing on the sidewalk, watching Dana. He was a street urchin, dressed in filthy, ragged clothes and torn shoes. Intense brown eyes flashed out of a face streaked with dirt. His right arm was missing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana watched the boy studying her. Dana smiled. \"Hello.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no reply. Dana shrugged and turned to Benn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later, they were on their way back to the Holiday Inn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Holiday Inn was filled with newspaper, radio, and television reporters, and they formed a disparate family. They were rivals, but because of the dangerous circumstances they found themselves in, they were always ready to help one another. They covered breaking stories together:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a riot in Montenegro...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a bombing in Vukovar...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hospital had been shelled in Petrovo Selo...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJean Paul Hubert was gone. He had been given another assignment, and Dana missed him terribly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Dana was leaving the hotel one morning, the little boy she had seen on the street was standing in the alley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJovan opened the door of the replacement Land Rover for Dana. \"Good morning, madam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning.\" The boy stood there, staring at Dana. She walked over to him. \"Good morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no reply. Dana said to Jovan, \"How do you say \u0027good morning\u0027 in Slovene?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little boy answered, \"Dobro jutro.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana turned to him. \"So you understand English.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kemal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How old are you, Kemal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned and walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s frightened of strangers,\" Jovan said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana looked after the boy. \"I don\u0027t blame him. So am I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour hours later, when the Land Rover returned to the alley in back of the Holiday Inn, Kemal was waiting near the entrance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Dana got out of the car, Kemal said, \"Twelve.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" Then Dana remembered. \"Oh.\" He was small for his age. She looked at his empty right shirtsleeve and started to ask him a question, then stopped herself. \"Where do you live, Kemal? Can we take you home?\" She watched him turn and walk away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJovan said, \"He has no manners.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana said quietly, \"Maybe he lost them when he lost his arm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat evening in the hotel dining room, the reporters were talking about the new rumors of an imminent peace. \"The UN has finally gotten involved,\" Gabriella Orsi declared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s about time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you ask me, it\u0027s too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s never too late,\" Dana said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following morning, two news stories came over the wires. The first one was about a peace agreement brokered by the United States and the United Nations. The second story was that Oslobodjenje, Sarajevo\u0027s newspaper, had been bombed out of existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our Washington bureaus are covering the peace agreement,\" Dana told Benn. \"Let\u0027s do a story on Oslobodjenje.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana was standing in front of the demolished building that had once housed Oslobodjenje. The camera\u0027s red light was on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People die here every day,\" Dana said into the lens, \"and buildings are destroyed. But this building was murdered. It housed the only free newspaper in Sarajevo, Oslobodjenje. It was a newspaper that dared to tell the truth. When it was bombed out of its headquarters, it was moved into the basement, to keep the presses alive. When there were no more newsstands to sell the papers from, its reporters went out on the streets to peddle them themselves. They were selling more than newspapers. They were selling freedom. With the death of Oslobodjenje, another piece of freedom has died here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his office, Matt Baker was watching the news broadcast. \"Dammit, she\u0027s good!\" He turned to his assistant. \"I want her to have her own satellite truck. Move on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Dana returned to her room, there was a visitor waiting for her. Colonel Gordan Divjak was lounging in a chair when Dana walked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped, startled. \"They didn\u0027t tell me I had a visitor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is not a social visit.\" His beady black eyes focused on her. \"I watched your broadcast about Oslobodjenje.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana studied him warily. \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were permitted to come into our country to report, not to make judgments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t make any - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not interrupt me. Your idea of freedom is not necessarily our idea of freedom. Do you understand me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m afraid I - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let me explain it to you, Miss Evans. You are a guest in my country. Perhaps you are a spy for your government.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not a - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do not interrupt me. I warned you at the airport. We are not playing games. We are at war. Anyone involved in espionage will be executed.\" His words were all the more chilling because they were spoken softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got to his feet. \"This is your last warning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana watched him leave. I\u0027m not going to let him frighten me, she thought defiantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was frightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA care package arrived from Matt Baker. It was an enormous box filled with candy, granola bars, canned foods, and a dozen other nonperishable items. Dana took it into the lobby to share it with the other reporters. They were delighted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now, that\u0027s what I call a boss,\" Satomi Asaka said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do I get a job with the Washington Tribune?\" Juan Santos joked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKemal was waiting in the alley again. The frayed, thin jacket he had on looked as though it was about to fall apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, Kemal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood there, silent, watching her from under half-closed lids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going shopping. Would you like to go with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me put it another way,\" Dana said, exasperated. She opened the back door of the vehicle. \"Get in the car. Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy stood there a moment, shocked, then slowly moved toward the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana and Jovan watched him climb into the backseat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana said to Jovan, \"Can you find a department store or clothing shop that\u0027s open?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey rode in silence for the first few minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you have a mother or father, Kemal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where do you live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana felt him move closer to her as though to absorb the warmth of her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clothing store was in the Bascarsija, the old market of Sarajevo. The front had been bombed out, but the store was open. Dana took Kemal\u0027s left hand and led him into the store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA clerk said, \"Can I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I want to buy a jacket for a friend of mine.\" She looked at Kemal. \"He\u0027s about his size.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This way, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the boy\u0027s section there was a rack of jackets. Dana turned to Kemal. \"Which one do you like?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKemal stood there, saying nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana said to the clerk, \"We\u0027ll take the brown one.\" She looked at Kemal\u0027s trousers. \"And I think we need a pair of trousers and some new shoes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they left the store half an hour later, Kemal was dressed in his new outfit. He slid into the backseat of the car without a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you know how to say thank you?\" Jovan demanded angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKemal burst into tears. Dana put her arms around him. \"It\u0027s all right,\" she said. \"It\u0027s all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat kind of a world does this to children?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they returned to the hotel, Dana watched Kemal turn and walk away without a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where does someone like that live?\" Dana asked Jovan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On the streets, madam. There are hundreds of orphans in Sarajevo like him. They have no homes, no families...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do they survive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"I do not know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day, when Dana walked out of the hotel, Kemal was waiting for her, dressed in his new outfit. He had washed his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe big news at the luncheon table was the peace treaty and whether it would work. Dana decided to go back to visit Professor Mladic Staka and ask what he thought about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked even more frail than the last time she had seen him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am happy to see you, Miss Evans. I hear you are doing wonderful broadcasts, but - \" He shrugged. \"Unfortunately, I have no electricity for my television set. What can I do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to get your opinion of the new peace treaty, Professor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned back in his chair and said thoughtfully, \"It is interesting to me that in Dayton, Ohio, they made a decision about what is going to happen to the future of Sarajevo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve agreed to a troika, a three-person presidency, composed of a Muslim, a Croat, and a Serb. Do you think it can work, Professor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only if you believe in miracles.\" He frowned. \"There will be eighteen national legislative bodies and another hundred and nine different local governments. It is a Tower of political Babel. It is what you Americans call a \u0027shotgun marriage.\u0027 None of them wants to give up their autonomy. They insist on having their own flags, their own license plates, their own currency.\" He shook his head. \"It is a morning peace. Beware of the night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana Evans had gone beyond being a mere reporter and was becoming an international legend. What came through in her television broadcasts was an intelligent human being filled with passion. And because Dana cared, her viewers cared, and shared her feelings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatt Baker began getting calls from other news outlets saying that they wanted to syndicate Dana Evans\u0027s broadcasts. He was delighted for her. She went over there to do good, he thought, and she\u0027s going to wind up doing well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith her own new satellite truck, Dana was busier than ever. She was no longer at the mercy of the Yugoslav satellite company. She and Benn decided what stories they wanted to do, and Dana would write them and broadcast them. Some of the stories were broadcast live, and others were taped. Dana and Benn and Andy would go out on the streets and photograph whatever background was needed, then Dana would tape her commentary in an editing room and send it back on the line to Washington.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt lunchtime, in the hotel dining room, large platters of sandwiches were placed in the center of the table. Journalists were busily helping themselves. Roderick Munn, from the BBC, walked into the room with an AP clipping in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to this, everybody.\" He read the clipping aloud. \"\u0027Dana Evans, a foreign correspondent for WTE, is now being syndicated by a dozen news stations. Miss Evans has been nominated for the coveted Peabody Award...\u0027\" The story went on from there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t we lucky to be associated with somebody so famous?\" one of the reporters said sarcastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, Dana walked into the dining room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, everybody. I don\u0027t have time for lunch today. I\u0027m going to take some sandwiches with me.\" She scooped up several sandwiches and covered them with paper napkins. \"See you later.\" They watched in silence as she left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Dana got outside, Kemal was there, waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good afternoon, Kemal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get into the car.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKemal slid into the backseat. Dana handed him a sandwich and sat there, watching him silently wolf it down. She handed him another sandwich, and he started to eat it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slowly,\" Dana said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where to?\" Jovan asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana turned to Kemal. \"Where to?\" He looked at her uncomprehendingly. \"We\u0027re taking you home, Kemal. Where do you live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to know. Where do you live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwenty minutes later, the car stopped in front of a large vacant lot near the banks of the Miljacka. Dozens of big cardboard boxes were scattered around, and the lot was littered with debris of all kinds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana got out of the car and turned to Kemal. \"Is this where you live?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reluctantly nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And other boys live here, too?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to do a story about this, Kemal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The police will come and take us away. Don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana studied him a moment. \"All right. I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning, Dana moved out of her room at the Holiday Inn. When she did not appear at breakfast, Gabriella Orsi from the Altre Station in Italy asked, \"Where\u0027s Dana?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoderick Munn replied, \"She\u0027s gone. She\u0027s rented a farmhouse to live in. She said she wanted to be by herself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikolai Petrovich, the Russian from Gorizont 22, said, \"We would all like to be by ourselves. So we are not good enough for her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a general feeling of disapproval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following afternoon, another large care package arrived for Dana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikolai Petrovich said, \"Since she is not here, we might as well enjoy it, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hotel clerk said, \"I\u0027m sorry. Miss Evans is having it picked up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later, Kemal arrived. The reporters watched him take the package and leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She doesn\u0027t even share with us anymore,\" Juan Santos grumbled. \"I think her publicity has gone to her head.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the next week, Dana filed her stories, but she did not appear at the hotel again. The resentment against her was growing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana and her ego were becoming the main topic of conversation. A few days later, when another huge care package was delivered to the hotel, Nikolai Petrovich went to the hotel clerk. \"Is Miss Evans having this package picked up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Russian hurried back into the dining room. \"There is another package,\" he said. \"Someone is going to pick it up. Why don\u0027t we follow him and tell Miss Evans our opinion of reporters who think they\u0027re too good for everyone else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a chorus of approval.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Kemal arrived to pick up the package, Nikolai said to him, \"Are you taking that to Miss Evans?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKemal nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She asked to see us. We\u0027ll go along with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKemal looked at him a moment, then shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll take you in one of our cars,\" Nikolai Petrovich said. \"You tell us where to go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen minutes later, a caravan of cars was making its way along deserted side streets. On the outskirts of the city, Kemal pointed to an old bombed-out farmhouse. The cars came to a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You go ahead and bring her the package,\" Nikolai said. \"We\u0027re going to surprise her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey watched Kemal walk into the farmhouse. They waited a moment, then moved toward the farmhouse and burst in through the front door. They stopped, in shock. The room was filled with children of all ages, sizes, and colors. Most of them were crippled. A dozen army cots had been set up along the walls. Dana was parceling out the contents of the care package to the children when the door flew open. She looked up in astonishment as the group charged in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What - what are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoderick Munn looked around, embarrassed. \"I\u0027m sorry, Dana. We made a - a mistake. We thought - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana turned to face the group. \"I see. They\u0027re orphans. They have nowhere to go and no one to take care of them. Most of them were in a hospital when it was bombed. If the police find them, they\u0027ll be put in what passes for an orphanage, and they\u0027ll die there. If they stay here, they\u0027ll die. I\u0027ve been trying to figure out a way to get them out of the country, but so far, nothing has worked.\" She looked at the group pleadingly. \"Do you have any ideas?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoderick Munn said slowly, \"I think I have. There\u0027s a Red Cross plane leaving for Paris tonight. The pilot is a friend of mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana asked hopefully, \"Would you talk to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMunn nodded. \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNikolai Petrovich said, \"Wait! We can\u0027t get involved in anything like that They\u0027ll throw us all out of the country.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to be involved,\" Munn told him. \"We\u0027ll handle it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m against it,\" Nikolai said stubbornly. \"It will place us all in danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about the children?\" Dana asked. \"We\u0027re talking about their lives.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLate in the afternoon, Roderick Munn came to see Dana. \"I talked to my friend. He said he would be happy to take the children to Paris, where they\u0027ll be safe. He has two boys of his own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana was thrilled. \"That\u0027s wonderful. Thank you so much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMunn looked at her. \"It is we who should thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt eight o\u0027clock that evening, a van with the Red Cross insignia on its sides pulled up in front of the farmhouse. The driver blinked the lights, and under the cover of darkness, Dana and the children hurried into the van.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifteen minutes later, it was rolling toward Butmir Airport. The airport had been temporarily closed except to the Red Cross planes that delivered supplies and took away the seriously wounded. The drive was the longest ride of Dana\u0027s life. It seemed to take forever. When she saw the lights of the airport ahead, she said to the children, \"We\u0027re almost there.\" Kemal was squeezing her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll be fine,\" Dana assured him. \"All of you will be taken care of.\" And she thought, I\u0027m going to miss you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the airport, a guard waved the van through, and it drove up to a waiting cargo plane with the Red Cross markings painted on the fuselage. The pilot was standing next to the plane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hurried up to Dana. \"For God\u0027s sake, you\u0027re late! Get them aboard, fast. We were due to take off twenty minutes ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana herded the children up the ramp into the plane. Kemal was the last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to Dana, his lips trembling. \"Will I see you again?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bet you will,\" Dana said. She hugged him and held him close for a moment, saying a silent prayer. \"Get aboard now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoments later, the door closed. There was a roar of the engines, and the plane began to taxi down the runway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana and Munn stood there, watching. At the end of the runway, the plane soared into the air and speared into the eastern sky, banking north toward Paris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was a wonderful thing you did,\" the driver said. \"I want you to know - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA car screeched to a stop behind them, and they turned. Colonel Gordan Divjak jumped out of the car and glared up at the sky where the plane was disappearing. At his side was Nikolai Petrovich, the Russian journalist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColonel Divjak turned to Dana. \"You are under arrest. I warned you that the punishment for espionage is death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDana took a deep breath. \"Colonel, if you\u0027re going to put me on trial for espionage - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked into Dana\u0027s eyes and said softly, \"Who said anything about a trial?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-best-laid-plans/page-12.html","bookId":2367,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:22 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:12:22 AM"}
