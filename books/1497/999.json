The struggle within the eyes of quite a number of people was replaced by a dense greed at this moment. The Heaven Mountain Blood Pool possessed an enormous allure to them. However, if they did not have the Psychic White Fox to lead the way, it was impossible for them to break out of the maze. Hence… although they clearly knew that Xiao Yan was strong, they could only go all out and risk it because of the allure of the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bang!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe greed in everyone’s eyes had just appeared when deep, muffled sound suddenly appeared. Immediately, everyone was stunned to see the human figure that was the first to charge forward flew back like a kite whose string had been cut. Finally, the figure violently collided with an enormous tree. The powerful force caused the enormous tree to form a couple of fist-sized cracks. The towering tree also began to wobble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Grug.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe human figure that landed on the ground immediately spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. His expression had instantaneously turned pale. His gaze contained a little shock and viciousness as he looked at the spot where Xiao Yan was located.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one managed to clearly see just what happened in the split second event. All they could see was that an unlucky fellow, who had been the first to break the tense atmosphere, suffered a fierce attack the moment he took a step forward. From the looks of it, the one who attacked was clearly the indifferent-looking young man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will not hold back the next time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s footsteps gently paused. His gaze stared at the tree door as his mouth slowly spat out some words that were filled with a stern killing intent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe throats of quite a number of people rolled upon hearing these words. The greed that had just surged from their hearts had also paled a little because of the shock. The looked at each other and none of them dared to attack first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If he is allowed to enter the maze, everyone will have to wait three years before one can gain such an opportunity again. If we can successfully charge in, we might still have a chance. As long as we can enter the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool, everything would be worth it. The clans and sects that everyone is in will definitely put in a great amount of effort to groom us. Our treatment would be much better than now. What great thing can one achieve by being so afraid?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA furious cry that was filled with incitement once again sounded while the greed in everyone’s hearts was quietly weakening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s eyes had turned unusually dark, cold at this moment. He slowly turned his head and looked at the person who had spoken. It was surprisingly still the person from earlier. The heart of the person immediately chilled when he saw Xiao Yan look over. He wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, took a couple of steps back, and swept his gaze around. He only let out a dark, cold smile when he saw that greed had once again surged in everyone’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, before the dark, cold smile, that had appeared on his face, could completely form, his body suddenly stiffened. This was because he saw a figure swiftly appearing in front of him in a ghost-like manner. Xiao Yan’s sinister face was also swiftly magnified in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe eyes of the person, who had spoken, narrowed when he saw Xiao Yan appear. Being a Dou Huang, his reaction was quite quick. His feet stomped on the ground and a rock pillar suddenly protruded from the ground. The rock pillar was in front of his feet, and with a push, he shot backwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heart of the person who spoke sighed in relief as he sensed the sound of wind beside his ear. He sternly cried out, “What is everyone waiting for? Although this fellow is a nine star Dou Haung, he is definitely no match for all of us together…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice suddenly halted, and his body suddenly stiffened. His eyes narrowed as he slowly lowered his head, only to see a hand, filled with a jade-green flame, viciously penetrating the back of his heart like a sharp blade. The high temperature of the flame prevented the hand from touching even a drop of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s expression was cold after killing this person with one strike. He could sense that the greed in the eyes of those fellows around had been completely stirred…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flame on Xiao Yan’s hand surged out and instantly incinerated the corpse of this person into ashes. His body moved and had already arrived beside Nalan Yanran in the next moment. After grabbing her, he charged to the tree door in a lightning-like manner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Boom! Boom!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dozens of meters in distance was not far. With Xiao Yan’s speed, he covered it within the blink of an eye. Just when his body was about to move, the ground around the tree door instantly began to shake. Over a dozen enormous sharp wooden pillars, agglomerated from Dou Qi, broke free from the ground and coincidentally sealed off the tree door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan narrowed his eyes and looked at the wooden pillars blocking the tree door. He waved his sleeves and a jade-green flame shot out in a lightning-like manner. It easily destroyed all of it. While he was swiftly running, Xiao Yan clenched his hand and the Heavy Xuan Ruler appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bang! Bang!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan had just destroyed the wooden pillar when the ground shook. A countless number of rock spikes explosively shot out from under Xiao Yan’s feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Be careful!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNalan Yanran hurriedly reminded him upon seeing the spikes. Her voice had just sounded when she sensed something tighten around her delicate waist. After which, her body flew out, rushed past the rock spike region in the blink of an eye, and landed outside of the tree door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chi! Chi!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn ear-piercing rushing wind sound suddenly appeared when her body landed. Numerous energy pillars, that contained powerful wind, smashed viciously toward Xiao Yan and Nalan Yanran.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan was expressionless. He held the heavy ruler tightly in his hand and began to swing it around. Layer after layer of ruler images immediately appeared and formed a ruler shadow defense in front of him, which wind could not even pass through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang bang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNumerous Dou Qi attacks landed on the ruler’s shadow defense, emitting wave after wave of clear explosions. The ruler shadows were also greatly reduced, and were just about to disappear when even more ruler shadows appeared. They were packed in an extremely dense manner that formed endlessly…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dark-black ruler’s shadow defense was just like a black circular barrier, covering Xiao Yan and Nalan Yanran. The fierce attacks could only cause the defensive barrier to ripple a little. The display of the Six Joint Body Flowing Ruler with Xiao Yan’s current strength was something that these fellows had difficulty destroying. Moreover, this ruler technique’s defense was a continuous one and was unafraid of the other party’s superior numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone’s heart involuntarily became chilled when the last Dou Qi attack was blocked by the black ruler shadow. Although this person was a nine star Dou Huang, there were nearly twenty Dou Huangs on their side, yet they were unable to break the other party’s defense despite attacking together? A nine star Dou Huang might be strong, but it was likely quite difficult to reach such a stage, no?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black-colored ruler shadows slowly disappeared. Immediately, the figure of the young man that caused everyone’s heart to feel a chill once again appeared. A pair of dark-black, emotionless eyes slowly lifted. Anyone glanced at with these eyes would feel the chilly feeling of being stared at by a poisonous snake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Go in first…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan had his back to Nalan Yanran as he softly said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNalan Yanran was startled when she heard this. She obediently nodded and said, “I will wait for you at the entrance of the maze. Do not walk around randomly after you enter. Be careful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan titled his head. Seeing this, Nalan Yanran, holding the white fox, carefully withdrew to where the tree door was. After which, she entered it in front of everyone’s fiery eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heavy ruler in Xiao Yan’s hands was slowly lifted when he saw Nalan Yanran enter. A powerful jade-green Dou Qi surged out and was immediately poured into the heavy ruler. Following the pouring in of the Dou Qi, the dark-black color of the Heavy Xuan Ruler swiftly transformed into a jade-green color.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone’s expressions involuntarily changed when they sensed the powerful Dou Qi that was emitted from the heavy ruler in Xiao Yan’s hands. Some of the cautious ones actually began to quietly withdraw. Only now did they understand that this young person in front of them was actually a powerful fellow that was not inferior to people like Tang Ying and Wang Chen…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is too late to leave now…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn icy smile surfaced on Xiao Yan’s face when he sensed that some people wanted to withdraw. Immediately, he focused his eyes and the heavy ruler in his hand was suddenly hacked forward!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Flame Splitting Tsunami!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA soft cry sounded in his heart and the light in this region suddenly soared. A jade-green ruler glow, over a hundred feet in size, emitted an ear-piercing cry, like a dragon that had broken free from the surface of water. It wildly shot out, causing the entire ground to become a mess at this moment. Numerous crack lines also began to spread like an earthquake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jade-green ruler glow’s speed was extremely quick. In the blink of an eye, it approached everyone. All those people could only maneuver the Dou Qi within their bodies in their shock as they swiftly formed a Dou Qi defense in front of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang bang bang bamg!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLow and deep energy explosions sounded repeatedly in this empty ground. Miserable cries randomly sounded as numerous figures landed heavily on the ground. Their bodies rubbed across it, forming numerous long scars as they did so. The enormous trees that were broken along the way turned the area within a fifty meter radius into a mess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Xiao Yan’s current strength, by displaying the Flame Splitting Tsunami with all his strength, even an expert at the peak of the Dou Huang class would not dare to easily receive it forcefully. The strength of these people did not exceed that of a five star Dou Huang. Their fates would naturally be miserable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ruler glow slowly scattered and the shaking ground slowly stilled. Xiao Yan raised his head, and glanced at the many human figures, who had landed a hundred meters away. Painful and frightened moans could be faintly heard. These fellows would likely end up seriously injured even if they did not die this time around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan shook his hand and the heavy ruler was placed into his Storage Ring. He was just about to turn around and enter the tree door when a strange elderly laugh suddenly appeared beside him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hee hee, little fellow, you are really quite vicious to have destroyed all of these fellows. However, are you planning to just leave after turning this place into such a mess?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s footsteps paused. He turned his head, only to see a gray-robed, old man with a somewhat humble-looking appearance standing on the tree branch beside him. The man was looking at him with a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dou Zong?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s eyes immediately narrowed after they swept over the gray-robed, old man. This person had appeared in an extremely strange manner. Even with Xiao Yan’s Spiritual Perception, he was unable to sense him. Moreover, was it not the case that overly strong people could not enter this Heaven Eye Mountain Range? Why was it that this person could…\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-998\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1000\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-999","bookId":1497,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:54 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:54 AM"}
