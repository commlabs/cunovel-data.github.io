Apparently you impressed the hell out of Colonel Johnson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert smiled. \"He\u0027s quite impressive himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver coffee, the Admiral asked, \"Are you ready to go to work?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eager.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. We have a situation in Rhodesia ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorking in the Office of Naval Intelligence was even more exciting than Robert had anticipated. Each assignment was different, and Robert was given the ones classified \"extremely sensitive\". He brought in a defector who revealed Noriega\u0027s drug-smuggling operation in Panama, exposed a mole working for Marcos in the American Consulate in Manila, and helped set up a secret listening post in Morocco. He was sent on missions to South America and to the East Indies. The only thing that disturbed him was the long separations from Susan. He hated to be away from her, and he missed her terribly. He had the excitement of his job to occupy him, but Susan had nothing. Robert\u0027s caseload kept increasing. He spent less and less time at home, and that was when the problem with Susan became serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhenever Robert came home, he and Susan would run hungrily into each other\u0027s arms and make passionate love. But those times began to be further and further apart. It seemed to Susan that no sooner did Robert return from one assignment, than he was sent away on another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo make matters worse, Robert could not discuss his work with her. Susan had no idea where he went or what he was doing. She knew only that whatever he was involved in was dangerous, and she was terrified that one day he would leave and never return. She dared not ask him questions. She felt like a stranger, completely shut out of an important part of his life. Of their life. I can\u0027t go on like this, Susan decided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Robert returned from a four-week assignment in Central America, Susan said, \"Robert, I think we had better have a talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the problem?\" Robert asked. He knew what the problem was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m frightened. We\u0027re slipping away from each other, and I don\u0027t want to lose us. I couldn\u0027t stand it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Susan ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait. Let me finish. Do you know how much time we\u0027ve spent together in the last four months? Less than two weeks. Whenever you come home I feel as though you\u0027re a visitor, instead of my husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took Susan in his arms and held her tightly. \"You know how much I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laid her head on his shoulder. \"Please don\u0027t let anything happen to us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t,\" he promised. \"I\u0027ll have a talk with Admiral Whittaker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Admiral will see you now, Commander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdmiral Whittaker was seated behind his desk, signing papers. He looked up as Robert entered and smiled. \"Welcome home, Robert, and congratulations. That was an excellent job in El Salvador.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thank you, Admiral.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wanted to talk to me? My secretary said it was urgent. What can I do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was difficult to begin. \"Well, sir, this is personal. I\u0027ve been married less than two years, and ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You made a wonderful choice, Robert. Susan\u0027s a fine woman.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I agree. The problem is that I\u0027m away most of the time, and she\u0027s unhappy about it.\" He added quickly, \"And she has every right to be. It isn\u0027t a normal situation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdmiral Whittaker leaned back in his chair and said, thoughtfully, \"Of course, what you\u0027re doing isn\u0027t a normal situation. Sometimes sacrifices have to be made.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" Robert said stubbornly, \"but I\u0027m not prepared to sacrifice my marriage. It means too much to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Admiral studied him reflectively. \"I see. What is it you\u0027re asking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was hoping that you could find some assignments for me where I\u0027m not away from home so much. This is such a large operation, there must be a hundred things I could do closer to home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Closer to home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Admiral said slowly, \"You\u0027ve certainly earned that. I don\u0027t see why something like that can\u0027t be arranged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert smiled in relief. \"That\u0027s very good of you, Admiral. I would certainly appreciate it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I think we can definitely arrange that. Tell Susan for me that the problem is solved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert stood up, beaming. \"I don\u0027t know how to thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdmiral Whittaker waved a hand of dismissal. \"You\u0027re too valuable a piece of manpower for me to let anything happen to you. Now go home to your bride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Robert told Susan the news, she was thrilled. She threw her arms around him. \"Oh, darling, that\u0027s wonderful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to ask him for a couple of weeks off so we can take a trip somewhere. It will be a second honeymoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve forgotten what a honeymoon is like,\" Susan murmured. \"Show me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert showed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdmiral Whittaker sent for Robert the following morning. \"I just wanted you to know I\u0027m making some arrangements about the matter we discussed yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Admiral.\" Now was the time to mention taking a leave. \"Sir ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdmiral Whittaker said, \"Something has come up, Robert.\" The Admiral began to pace. When he spoke, there was a note of deep concern in his voice. \"I\u0027ve just been informed that the CIA has been infiltrated. It seems that there has been a steady leak of Top Secret information. All they know about the spy is that his code name is \u0027the Fox\u0027. He\u0027s in Argentina right now. They need someone outside the Agency to handle the operation. The Deputy Director of the CIA has asked for you. They would like you to track the man down and bring him back. I told them the decision is up to you. Do you want to undertake it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert hesitated. \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ll have to pass on it, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I respect your decision, Robert. You\u0027ve been travelling constantly and have never turned down an assignment. I know it hasn\u0027t been easy on your marriage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like to take on this job, sir. It\u0027s just that ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to say it, Robert. My opinion of your work and dedication will always remain the same. I just have one favour to ask of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that, Admiral?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Deputy Director of the CIA asked to meet with you, regardless of your decision. As a courtesy. You don\u0027t mind, do you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly the next morning Robert drove to Langley for his meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down, Commander,\" the Deputy Director said after Robert entered the large corner office. \"I\u0027ve heard a lot about you. All good things, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Deputy Director was a man in his early sixties, reed thin with fine white hair and a small brush moustache that moved up and down as he drew on his pipe. A Yale graduate, he had joined the OSS during World War II and then moved into the CIA when it was formed after the conflict. He rose steadily up the ranks of the most powerful intelligence agency in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to know, Commander, that I respect your decision.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I appreciate that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There is one fact, however, that I feel I should bring to your attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The President is personally involved in the operation to unmask the Fox.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know that, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He regards it - as I do, too - as one of the most important assignments this agency has had since its inception. I know of your situation at home, and I\u0027m sure the President is sympathetic, too. He\u0027s a real family man. But your not taking on this assignment might throw - how should I say it - a cloud on ONI and Admiral Whittaker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Admiral had nothing to do with my decision, sir,\" Robert said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand that, Commander, but will the President understand that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe honeymoon will have to be postponed, Robert thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Robert broke the news to Susan, he said gently, \"This is my last overseas assignment. After this I\u0027ll be home so much you\u0027ll get sick of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled up at him. \"There isn\u0027t that much time in the world. We\u0027re going to be together forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chase after the Fox was the most frustrating thing Robert had ever experienced. He picked up his trail in Argentina, but missed his quarry by one day. The trail led to Tokyo and China and then Malaysia. Whoever the Fox was, he left just enough of a trail to lead to where he had been, but never to where he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe days turned into weeks and the weeks turned into months, and always Robert was just behind the Fox. He called Susan almost every day. In the beginning, it was, \"I\u0027ll be home in a few days, darling.\" And then, \"I might be home next week.\" And then, finally, \"I\u0027m not sure when I\u0027ll be back.\" In the end, Robert had to give up. He had been on the Fox\u0027s trail for two and a half months, with no success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he returned to Susan, she seemed changed. A little cooler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, darling,\" Robert apologized. \"I had no idea it would take so long. It was just ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ll never let you go, will they, Robert?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Of course they will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"I don\u0027t think so. I\u0027ve taken a job at Washington Memorial Hospital.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was taken aback. \"You\u0027ve what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to be a nurse again. I can\u0027t sit around waiting for you to come home to me, wondering where you are, and what you\u0027re doing, wondering whether you\u0027re dead or alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Susan, I ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right, my sweetheart. At least I\u0027ll be doing something useful while you\u0027re gone. It will make the waiting easier.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Robert had no answer to that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reported his failure to Admiral Whittaker. The Admiral was sympathetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s my fault for agreeing to let you do it. From now on, we\u0027ll let the CIA handle their own damned problems. I\u0027m sorry, Robert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert told him about Susan taking a job as a nurse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s probably a good idea,\" the Admiral said thoughtfully. \"It will take the pressure off your marriage. If you took on some overseas caseloads now and then, I\u0027m sure it won\u0027t matter as much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now and then\" turned out to be almost constantly. That was when the marriage really began to disintegrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan worked at Washington Memorial Hospital as an operating-room nurse and whenever Robert was home she tried to take time off to be with him, but she was caught up more and more in her work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m really enjoying it, darling. I feel I\u0027m doing something useful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe would talk to Robert about her patients, and he remembered how caring she had been with him, how she had nurtured him back to health, back to life. He was pleased that she was doing important work that she loved, but the fact was, they were seeing less and less of each other. The emotional distance between them was widening. There was an awkwardness now that had not existed before. They were like two strangers trying desperately hard to make conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Robert returned to Washington from a six-week assignment in Turkey, he took Susan out to dinner at Sans Souci.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan said, \"We have a new patient at the hospital. He was in a bad plane crash, and the doctors didn\u0027t think he was going to live, but I\u0027m going to see to it that he does.\" Her eyes were glowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was like that with me, Robert thought. And he wondered if she had leaned over the new patient and said, \"Get well. I\u0027m waiting for you.\" He rejected the thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s so nice, Robert. All the nurses are crazy about him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the nurses? he wondered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a small, nagging doubt at the back of his mind, but he managed to get rid of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey ordered dinner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following Saturday, Robert left for Portugal, and when he returned three weeks later, Susan greeted him excitedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Monte walked today for the first time!\" Her kiss was perfunctory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Monte?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Monte Banks. That\u0027s his name. He\u0027s going to be fine. The doctors couldn\u0027t believe it, but we wouldn\u0027t give up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe. \"Tell me about him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s really darling. He\u0027s always giving us gifts. He\u0027s very wealthy. He flies his own plane and he was in a bad crash, and ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of gifts?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you know, just little things ... candies and flowers and books and records. He tried to give all of us expensive watches but, of course, we had to refuse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has a yacht, polo ponies ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the day Robert began calling him \"Moneybags\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan talked about him every time she came home from the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s really dear, Robert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDear was dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he\u0027s so thoughtful. Do you know what he did today? He had lunch sent from the Jockey Club for all the nurses on the floor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man was sickening. Ridiculously, Robert found himself getting angry. \"Is this wonderful patient of yours married?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, darling. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just wondered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. \"For heaven\u0027s sake, you\u0027re not jealous, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of some old man who\u0027s just learning to walk? Of course not.\" Like hell I\u0027m not. But he wouldn\u0027t give Susan the satisfaction of saying so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Robert was at home, Susan tried not to talk about her patient, but if she did not bring up the subject, Robert would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is old Moneybags doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"His name is not Moneybags,\" she chided him. \"It\u0027s Monte Banks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever.\" It was too bad the sonofabitch couldn\u0027t have died in the plane crash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following day was Susan\u0027s birthday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll tell you what,\" Robert said, enthusiastically, \"we\u0027ll celebrate. We\u0027ll go out and have a wonderful dinner somewhere and ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to work at the hospital until eight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. I\u0027ll pick you up there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. Monte is dying to meet you. I\u0027ve told him all about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I look forward to meeting the old man,\" Robert assured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Robert arrived at the hospital, the receptionist said, \"Good evening, Commander. Susan is working in the orthopedic ward on the third floor. She\u0027s expecting you.\" She picked up the telephone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Robert got off the elevator, Susan was waiting for him, wearing her white starched uniform, and his heart skipped a beat. She was, oh, so damned beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, gorgeous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan smiled, strangely ill at ease. \"Hello, Robert. I\u0027ll be off duty in a few minutes. Come on. I\u0027ll introduce you to Monte.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe led him into a large private room filled with books and flowers and baskets of fruit, and said, \"Monte, this is my husband, Robert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert stood there, staring at the man in the bed. He was three or four years older than Robert and resembled Paul Newman. Robert despised him on sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m certainly pleased to meet you, Commander. Susan has been telling me all about you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs that what they talked about when she was at his bedside in the middle of the night?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s very proud of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s it, buddy, throw me a few crumbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan was looking at Robert, willing him to be polite. He made an effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand you\u0027ll be getting out of here soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, thanks mostly to your wife. She\u0027s a miracle worker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome on, sailor. Do you think I\u0027m going to let some other nurse have that great body? \"Yes, that\u0027s her speciality.\" Robert could not keep the bitterness out of his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe birthday dinner was a fiasco. All Susan wanted to talk about was her patient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he remind you of anyone, darling?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boris Karloff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you have to be so rude to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said coldly, \"I thought I was very civil. I don\u0027t happen to like the man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan stared at him. \"You don\u0027t even know him. What don\u0027t you like about him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t like the way he looks at you. I don\u0027t like the way you look at him. I don\u0027t like the way our marriage is going to hell. God, I don\u0027t want to lose you. \"Sorry. I guess I\u0027m just tired.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey finished their dinner in silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning, as Robert was getting ready to go to the office, Susan said, \"Robert, I have something to say to you ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was as though he had been struck in the pit of his stomach. He could not bear to have her put what was happening into words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Susan ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I love you. I\u0027ll always love you. You\u0027re the dearest, most wonderful man I\u0027ve ever known.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, let me finish. This is very hard for me. In the last year we\u0027ve only spent minutes together. We don\u0027t have a marriage anymore. We\u0027ve drifted apart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery word was a knife stabbing into him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right,\" he said desperately. \"I\u0027ll change. I\u0027ll quit the Agency. Now. Today. We\u0027ll go away somewhere and ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head. \"No, Robert. We both know that wouldn\u0027t work. You\u0027re doing what you want to do. If you stopped doing it because of me you would always resent me. This isn\u0027t anybody\u0027s fault. It just ... happened. I want a divorce.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as though the world had caved in on him. He felt suddenly sick to his stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t mean that, Susan, we\u0027ll find a way to ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s too late. I\u0027ve been thinking about this for a long time. All the while you were away and I sat home alone and waited for you to come back I thought about it. We\u0027ve been living separate lives. I need more than that. I need something you can\u0027t give me anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood there, fighting to control his emotions. \"Does this ... does this have anything to do with Moneybags?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan hesitated. \"Monte has asked me to marry him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could feel his bowels turning to water. \"And you\u0027re going to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was some kind of crazy nightmare. This isn\u0027t happening, he thought. It can\u0027t be. His eyes filled with tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan put her arms around him and held him close. \"I will never again feel about any man the way I felt about you. I loved you with all my heart and soul. I will always love you. You are my dearest friend.\" She pulled back and looked into his eyes. \"But that isn\u0027t enough. Do you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll he understood was that she was tearing him apart. \"We could try again. We\u0027ll start over and ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Robert.\" Her voice was choked. \"I\u0027m so sorry, but it\u0027s finished.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan flew to Reno for a divorce, and Commander Robert Bellamy went on a two-week drunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOld habits die hard. Robert telephoned a friend at the FBI. Al Traynor had crossed Robert\u0027s path half a dozen times in the past, and Robert trusted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tray, I need a favour.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A favour? You need a psychiatrist. How the hell could you let Susan get away?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe news was probably all over town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a long, sad story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m really sorry, Robert. She was a great lady. I ... never mind. What can I do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d like you to run a computer check on someone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got it. Give me a name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Monte Banks. It\u0027s just a routine inquiry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. What do you want to know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s probably not even in your files, Tray, but if he is ... did he ever get a parking ticket, beat his dog, run a red light? The usual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m curious about where he got his money. I\u0027d like a fix on his background.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, just routine, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And, Tray, let\u0027s keep this between us. It\u0027s personal. Okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem. I\u0027ll call you in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks. I owe you a lunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert replaced the receiver and thought, Portrait of a man clutching at straws. What am I hoping for, that he\u0027s Jack the Ripper, and Susan will come flying back into my arms?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly the following morning, Dustin Thornton sent for Robert. \"What are you working on, Commander?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knows perfectly well what I\u0027m working on, Robert thought. \"I\u0027m winding up my file on the diplomat from Singapore, and ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t seem to be occupying enough of your time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I beg your pardon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In case you\u0027ve forgotten, Commander, the Office of Naval Intelligence is not mandated to investigate American citizens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert was watching him, puzzled. \"What are you ...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been notified by the FBI that you have been trying to obtain information that is completely out of the jurisdiction of this agency.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert felt a sudden rush of anger. That sonofabitch Traynor had betrayed him. So much for friendship. \"It was a personal matter,\" Robert said. \"I ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The computers of the FBI are not there for your convenience, nor to help you harass private citizens. Do I make myself clear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert raced back to his office. His fingers trembled as he dialled 202-324-3000. A voice answered, \"FBI.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Al Traynor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just a moment, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA minute later, a man\u0027s voice came on the line. \"Hello. May I help you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027m calling Al Traynor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Agent Traynor is no longer with this office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert felt a shock go through him. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Agent Traynor has been transferred.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Transferred?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boise. But he won\u0027t be up there for a while. A long while, I\u0027m afraid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was struck by a hit-and-run driver last night while jogging in Rock Creek Park. Can you believe it? Some creep must have been drunk out of his mind. He ran his car right up on the jogging path. Traynor\u0027s body was thrown over forty feet. He may not make it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert replaced the receiver. His mind was spinning. What the hell was going on? Monte Banks, the blue-eyed all-American boy, was being protected. From what? By whom? Jesus, Robert thought, what is Susan getting herself into?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went to visit her that afternoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was in her new apartment, a beautiful duplex on \"M\" Street. He wondered whether Moneybags had paid for it. It had been weeks since he had seen Susan, and the sight of her took his breath away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Forgive me for barging in like this, Susan. I know I promised not to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said it was something serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is.\" Now that he was here, he didn\u0027t know how to begin. Susan, I came here to save you? She would laugh in his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s about Monte.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. \"What about him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the difficult part. How could he tell her what he himself didn\u0027t know? All he knew was that something was terribly wrong. Monte Banks was in the FBI computer all right, with a tickler: No information to be given out without proper authorization. And the inquiry had been kicked right back to ONI. Why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think he\u0027s ... he\u0027s not what he seems to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Susan - where does he get his money?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked surprised at the question. \"Monte has a very successful import-export business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe oldest cover in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should have known better than to have come charging in with his half-baked theory. He felt like a fool. Susan was waiting for an answer and he had none.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you asking?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was ... I just wanted to make sure he\u0027s right for you,\" Robert said lamely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Robert.\" Her voice was filled with disappointment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess I shouldn\u0027t have come.\" You got that right, buddy. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan walked up to him and gave him a hug. \"I understand,\" she said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she didn\u0027t understand. She didn\u0027t understand that an innocent inquiry about Monte Banks had been stonewalled, referred to the Office of Naval Intelligence, and that the man who had tried to get that information had been transferred to the boondocks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were other ways of obtaining information, and Robert went about them circumspectly. He telephoned a friend who worked for Forbes Magazine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Robert! Long time no see. What can I do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Monte Banks? Interesting you should mention him. We think he should be on our Forbes Four Hundred wealthiest list, but we can\u0027t get any hard information on him. Do you have anything for us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA zero.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert went to the public library and looked up Monte Banks in Who\u0027s Who. He was not listed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned to the microfiche, and looked up back issues of the Washington Post around the time that Monte Banks had had his plane accident. There was a brief item about the plane crash. It mentioned Banks as an entrepreneur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt all sounded innocent enough. Maybe I\u0027m wrong, Robert thought. Maybe Monte Banks is a guy in a white hat. Our government wouldn\u0027t have protected him if he was a spy, a criminal, into drugs ... The truth is that I\u0027m still trying to hold onto Susan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing a bachelor again was a loneliness, an emptiness, a round of busy days and sleepless nights. A tide of despair would sweep over him without warning, and he would weep. He wept for himself and for Susan and for everything that they had lost. Susan\u0027s presence was everywhere. The apartment was alive with reminders of her. Robert was cursed with total recall, and each room tormented him with memories of Susan\u0027s voice, her laughter, her warmth. He remembered the soft hills and valleys of her body as she lay in bed naked, waiting for him, and the ache inside him was unbearable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis friends were concerned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t be alone, Robert.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd their rallying cry became, \"Have I got a girl for you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were tall and beautiful, and small and sexy. They were models and secretaries and advertising executives and divorcees and lawyers. But none of them was Susan. He had nothing in common with any of them, and trying to make small talk with strangers in whom he had no interest only made him feel more lonely. Robert had no desire to go to bed with any of them. He wanted to be alone. He wanted to rewind the film back to the beginning, to rewrite the script. With hindsight, it was so easy to see his mistakes, to see how the scene with Admiral Whittaker should have played.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe CIA has been infiltrated by a man called The Fox. The Deputy Director has asked for you to track him down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, Admiral. Sorry. I\u0027m taking my wife on a second honeymoon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to re-edit his life, to give it a happy ending. Too late. Life did not give second chances. He was alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did his own shopping, cooked his meals for himself and went to the neighbourhood laundromat once a week when he was home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a lonely, miserable time in Robert\u0027s life. But the worst was yet to come. A beautiful designer he had met in Washington telephoned him several times to invite him to dinner. Robert had been reluctant, but he had finally accepted. She prepared a delicious candlelight dinner for the two of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a very good cook,\" Robert said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m very good at everything.\" And there was no mistaking her meaning. She moved closer to him. \"Let me prove it to you.\" She put her hands on his thighs and ran her tongue around his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s been a long time, Robert thought. Maybe too long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went to bed, and to Robert\u0027s consternation, it was a disaster. For the first time in his life, Robert was impotent. He was humiliated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry, darling,\" she said. \"It will be all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRobert went home feeling embarrassed, crippled. He knew that in some crazy, convoluted way, he had felt that making love to another woman was a betrayal of Susan. How stupid can I get?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to make love again, several weeks later, with a bright secretary at ONI. She had been wildly passionate in bed, stroking his body and taking him inside her hot mouth. But it was no use. He wanted only Susan. After that, he stopped trying. He thought of consulting a doctor, but he was too ashamed. He knew the answer to his problem, and there was no solution. He poured all his energy into work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSusan called him at least once a week. \"Don\u0027t forget to pick up your shirts at the laundry,\" she would say. Or: \"I\u0027m sending over a maid to clean up the apartment. I\u0027ll bet it\u0027s a mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach call made the loneliness more intolerable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had called him the night before her wedding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Robert, I want you to know I\u0027m getting married tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was difficult for him to breathe. He began to hyperventilate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Susan ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love Monte,\" she said, \"but I love you, too. I\u0027ll love you until the day I die. I don\u0027t want you ever to forget that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was there to say to that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Robert, are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSure. I\u0027m great. Except that I\u0027m a fucking eunuch. Scratch the adjective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Robert?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could not bear to punish her with his problem. \"I\u0027m fine. Just do me a favour, will you, baby?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything I can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t ... don\u0027t let him take you on your honeymoon to any of the places we went to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hung up and went out and got drunk again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat had been a year earlier. That was the past. He had been forced to face the reality that Susan now belonged to someone else. He had to live in the present. He had work to do. It was time to have a chat with Leslie Mothershed, the photographer who had the photographs and names of the witnesses Robert had been assigned to track down on what was going to be his last assignment. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-doomsday-conspiracy/page-18.html","bookId":2363,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:10:21 AM"}
