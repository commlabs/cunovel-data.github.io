It never mattered how a fellow requested his hair cut; he always walked out with a little bit off the top and the sides thinned out. Of course, we\u0027re talking about a real haircut here, none of that \"hair-styling\" stuff. For one dollar and fifty cents, you got the treatment: wrapped to the neck under a crisp blue-striped barber towel, scissors-trimmed and clippers-raked, hot lather applied to the back of your neck and the fine hairs there scraped off with a freshly stropped straight razor, followed by a liberal dousing from one of the mystery bottles of Wildroot, Vitalis, or Brylcreem hair dressings. I say \"mystery bottles\" because every time I got my hair cut at Mr. Dollar\u0027s, those bottles, on a shelf above the barber chair, were exactly half full and never seemed to go up or down an inch. When the haircutting was done-\"the scalping\" was much the better term for it-and Mr. Dollar unpinned the barber towel from around your neck and swept the dead hairs out of your collar with a brush that felt like whiskers from a boar\u0027s snout, the adults got to reach into the peanut-brittle jar and the kids got their choice of lime, lemon, grape, or cherry suckers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hot day,\" Mr. Dollar commented as he lifted up Dad\u0027s hair with a comb and snipped the ends with scissors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Known it hotter, though. One hundred and three degrees this day in 1936.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One hundred and four degrees this day in 1927!\" said Mr. Owen Cathcoate, an aged specimen who was playing checkers with Mr. Gabriel \"Jazzman\" Jackson at the back of the barbershop, where the overhead fan kept the place the coolest. Mr. Cathcoate\u0027s wrinkled face was dotted with liver spots, like a map of some strange and foreign country. He had narrow-slit eyes and long-fingered hands, and his scraggly yellowish-white hair hung down around his shoulders, which must have been torture for Mr. Dollar to have to look at. Mr. Jackson was a big-bellied black man with iron-gray hair and a small, neat mustache, and he shined and repaired shoes for people who brought them in, his workshop being at the rear of Mr. Dollar\u0027s place. Mr. Jackson got his nickname because, as Dad told me, he could \"blow butterflies and hornets out of that clarinet of his.\" The clarinet, in a well-seasoned black case, was never far from Mr. Jackson\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Be a whole lot hotter \u0027fore July gets here,\" Mr. Jackson said as he pondered the pieces. He started to make a move and then thought better of it. \"Owen, I do believe you\u0027re tryin\u0027 to put me between a rock and a hard place, ain\u0027t youi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t dream of such a thing, Mr. Jackson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, you sly old fox you!\" the Jazzman said when he saw the simple but deadly trap Mr. Cathcoate had laid open for him. \"Gonna skin me up and serve me for dinner, huhi Well, I\u0027d be mighty tough to chew on!\" He made a move that for the moment got him out of danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Dollar was short and stocky and had a face like a contented bulldog. His gray eyebrows stuck out everywhichway like wild weeds, and his hair was shaved to the sandy scalp. He could make the neatest parts of anybody I\u0027ve ever seen. He knew all there was to know about the history of Zephyr. Because he had been the only barber in town for over twenty years, he had his finger on the roaring pulse of gossip and he could tell you everything that was going on, if you had an afternoon to sit and listen. He also had a nifty collection of tattered comic books, Field Streams, and Sports Illustrateds, and I had heard from Davy Ray that Mr. Dollar kept a box of Stag, Confidential, and argosy magazines in the back for adults only.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coryi\" Mr. Dollar said as he cut my father\u0027s hair. \"You met the new boy yeti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No siri\" I didn\u0027t know there was a new boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Came in here yesterday with his dad to get a haircut. Got good hair, but that cowlick about blunted my scissors.\" Snip, snip, they sang. \"He just moved here last week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"New family rentin\u0027 that house on the corner of Greenhowe and Shantucki\" Dad asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, that\u0027s them. The Curliss family. Nice people. all of \u0027em got good hair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s Mr. Curliss doi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Salesman,\" Mr. Dollar said. \"Sells shirts for some company in atlanta. The boy\u0027s a couple of years younger than Cory. I set him up on the horse and he didn\u0027t squirm a bit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe horse was a carved golden palomino that had been salvaged from a doomed merry-go-round somewhere; now it was bolted to the floor next to the regular barber\u0027s chair. Only babies got their hair cut while sitting on the horse, even though there were times when I wished I might be able to sit on that horse again and put my feet in the stirrups while my hair was being snipped. Still, the fact that the Curliss boy-at nine or ten years of age, say-wanted to sit on the horse told me he must be a pansy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Curliss seems like a decent fella,\" Mr. Dollar went on, following the scissors across my father\u0027s scalp. \"Quiet, though. Kinda timid for a salesman, I\u0027d say. That\u0027s a hard row to hoe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll bet,\" Dad said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got the impression Mr. Curliss has moved around quite a bit. He told me all the places he and the family have lived. I guess, bein\u0027 a salesman, you\u0027d have to be prepared to go where the company says go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t do that,\" Dad said. \"I\u0027ve gotta have roots.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Dollar nodded. He left that topic and wandered through others like a man through high grass, not seeing anything but the next step. \"Yessir,\" he said. \"If them Beatle boys came in here, they\u0027d sure \u0027nuff leave lookin\u0027 like men \u0027stead of women.\" His eyebrows squeezed together as he wandered on in a new direction. \"Communists say they\u0027re gonna bury us. Gotta stop \u0027em while we can, \u0027fore they get to our country. Send our boys to bust their tails in that place over there... y\u0027know, where they grow all the bamboo.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Vietnam,\" Dad supplied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. That\u0027s the place. Kill \u0027em there and we won\u0027t have to worry no more.\" Mr. Dollar\u0027s scissors were getting up to speed. a new thought was being born somewhere between Mr. Dollar\u0027s ears. \"J.T. ever figure out who went down in Saxon\u0027s Lake, Tomi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI watched my father\u0027s face. No expression registered there, but I knew this question must be stabbing him. \"No, Perry. He never did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was a federal man, is what I think,\" the Jazzman ventured. \"Must\u0027ve been lookin\u0027 for stills. I think the Blaylocks killed him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what Mr. Sculley believes, too,\" Dad said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Blaylocks are bad news, that\u0027s the truth.\" Mr. Dollar switched on his clipper and worked on Dad\u0027s sideburns. \"Wouldn\u0027t be the first man they\u0027ve killed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why do you say thati\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sim Sears used to buy whiskey from the youngest boy, Donny. Oh-\" Mr. Dollar looked at me. \"I\u0027m not talkin\u0027 out of school, am Ii\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all right,\" Dad told him. \"Go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, this is from Sim\u0027s mouth, so I guess he\u0027s come to grips with it. anyway, Donny Blaylock used to sell moonshine to Sim, and Sim told me Donny and him got drunk up in the woods one night-the night that meteor fell up there near Union Town -and Donny told him things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thingsi\" Dad prodded. \"What thingsi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Donny told Sim he\u0027d killed a man,\" Mr. Dollar said. \"Didn\u0027t tell him the why, the when, or the who. Just that he\u0027d killed a man and he was glad of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does J.T. know about thisi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nope. and he won\u0027t hear it from me, either. I don\u0027t want to get J.T. killed. You ever see Biggun Blaylocki\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Big as a moose and full of the devil. If I told J.T. what Sim had told me, he\u0027d have to go out and find the Blaylocks. If he did find \u0027em, which I doubt he could, that bunch would hang him up by his heels and cut his throat open like a-\" again Mr. Dollar looked at me, sitting there, all eyes and ears, behind a Hawkman comic book. \"Well, I kinda figure that\u0027d be the last of our sheriff,\" Mr. Dollar finished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Blaylocks don\u0027t own the county!\" Dad said. \"If they committed a murder, they ought to pay for it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right, they should,\" Mr. Dollar agreed as he returned to his clipping. \"Biggun came in here last November to pick up a pair of boots he was havin\u0027 resoled. Remember that, Jazzmani\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shore do. Fine, expensive boots. I was scared to death of gettin\u0027 a scuff on \u0027em.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what Biggun said as he was payin\u0027 for his bootsi\" Mr. Dollar asked my father. \"He said they were his stompin\u0027 boots, and anybody who got under \u0027em wouldn\u0027t be standin\u0027 up again. I figured that to mean he didn\u0027t want anybody messin\u0027 in his business. So who\u0027s gonna be fool enough to go lookin\u0027 to get killed by the Blaylocksi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what happened to that fella at the bottom of the lake,\" the Jazzman said. \"He was messin\u0027 in the Blaylocks\u0027 business.\" Bidness, he pronounced it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t care if they brew up \u0027shine and sell it outta the back of their trucks,\" Mr. Dollar went on. \"No harm done to me. I don\u0027t care if they fix the stock car races, because I\u0027m not a gambler. I don\u0027t care what they do to them fallen angels at Grace Stafford\u0027s, because I\u0027m a family man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hold on,\" Dad said. \"What about Grace Stafford\u0027s placei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"ain\u0027t her place. She just manages it. The Blaylocks own it, lock, stock, and hair curlers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDad grunted softly. \"I didn\u0027t know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah!\" Mr. Dollar applied lather to the back of Dad\u0027s neck and worked a straight razor along the leather strop. \"The Blaylocks are rakin\u0027 it in, that\u0027s for sure. Makin\u0027 a killin\u0027 off the air Force fellas.\" With a steady hand, he began shaving my father\u0027s neck. \"The Blaylocks are too much for J.T. to handle. It\u0027d take Edgar Hoover himself to throw \u0027em in jail.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wyatt Earp could do it.\" Mr. Cathcoate spoke up now. \"If he was still alive, I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I reckon he could at that, Owen.\" Mr. Dollar glanced at me, gauging my interest, and then back to the old man. \"Hey, Owen! I don\u0027t think young Cory here knows about you and Wyatt Earp!\" Mr. Dollar winked at me conspiratorially. \"Tell him the tale, why don\u0027t youi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Cathcoate didn\u0027t answer for a moment, but it was his turn and he didn\u0027t move any of the checkers pieces. \"Naw,\" he replied at last. \"I\u0027ll let it rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Owen! Tell the boy! You want to hear it, don\u0027t you, Coryi\" Before I could say yes or no, Mr. Dollar plowed on. \"See therei He wants to hear it!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Long time gone,\" Mr. Cathcoate said quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eighteen hundred and eighty-one, wasn\u0027t iti October twenty-sixth at Tombstone, arizonai You were all of nine years oldi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\" Mr. Cathcoate nodded. \"I was nine years old.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"and tell the boy what you did on that day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Cathcoate sat staring at the checkers board. \"Go on, Owen,\" the Jazzman urged in a gentle voice. \"You tell him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... killed a man on that day,\" Mr. Cathcoate said. \"and I saved the life of Wyatt Earp at the O.K. Corral.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you go, Cory!\" Mr. Dollar grinned. \"Bet you didn\u0027t know you were sittin\u0027 in here with a real live gunfighter, did youi\" The way Mr. Dollar said that, though, made me think he didn\u0027t believe a word of it, and that he enjoyed goading Mr. Cathcoate about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course I\u0027d heard about the O.K. Corral. Every boy with even a passing interest in cowboys and the Wild West knew that story, about the day the Earp brothers-Wyatt, Virgil, and Morgan-and cardsharp Doc Holliday faced down the rustling Clantons and McLowerys in the hot dust of Tombstone. \"Is that for real, Mr. Cathcoatei\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For real. I was lucky that day. I was just a kid, didn\u0027t know nothin\u0027 about guns. almost shot my foot off.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell him how you saved ol\u0027 Wyatt,\" Mr. Dollar urged as he blotted the last of the lather off the back of Dad\u0027s neck with a steaming towel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Cathcoate frowned. I figured he didn\u0027t like remembering it, or else he was trying to put the details together again. a ninety-two-year-old man has to open a lot of locks to recall a day when he was nine years old. But I suppose that particular day was worth remembering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Cathcoate finally said, \"Wasn\u0027t supposed to be anybody on the street. Everybody knew the Earps, Doc Holliday, the McLowerys, and the Clantons were gonna spill blood. It had been a long time brewin\u0027. But I was there, hidin\u0027 behind a shack. Little fool, me.\" He pushed his chair back from the checkers board, and he sat with his long-fingered hands twined together and the fan\u0027s breeze stirring his hair. \"I heard all the shoutin\u0027, and all the guns goin\u0027 off. I heard bullets hittin\u0027 flesh. That\u0027s a sound you don\u0027t forget if you live to be a hundred and ninety-two.\" His slitted eyes stared at me, but I could tell he was looking toward the past, where dust clouds rose from the bloodstained earth and shadows aimed their six-guns. \"a terrible lot of shootin\u0027,\" he said. \"a bullet went through the shack next to my head. I heard it whine. Then I got down low and I stayed there. Pretty soon a man came staggerin\u0027 past me and fell to his knees. It was Billy Clanton. He was all shot up, but he had a gun in his hand. He looked at me. Right at me. and then he coughed and blood spurted out of his mouth and nose and he fell on his face right next to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wow!\" I said, my arms chillbumped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, there\u0027s more!\" Mr. Dollar announced. \"Tell him, Owen!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"a shadow fell on me,\" Mr. Cathcoate said, his voice raspy. \"I looked up, and I saw Wyatt Earp. His face was covered with dust, and he seemed ten feet tall. He said, \u0027Run home, boy.\u0027 I can hear him say that, clear as a bell. But I was scared and I stayed where I was, and Wyatt Earp walked on around to the other side of the shed. The fight was over. Clantons and McLowerys were lyin\u0027 on the ground shot to pieces. Then it happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happenedi\" I asked when Mr. Cathcoate paused to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fella who\u0027d been hidin\u0027 in an empty rain barrel raised up and took aim with his pistol at Wyatt Earp\u0027s back. I\u0027d never seen him before. But he was right there, as close to me as you are. He took aim, and I heard him click the trigger back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This here\u0027s the good part,\" Mr. Dollar said. \"Then what, Oweni\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then... I picked up Billy Clanton\u0027s pistol. Thing was as heavy as a cannon, and it had blood all over the grip. I could hardly hold it.\" Mr. Cathcoate was silent; his eyes closed. He went on: \"Wasn\u0027t time to call out. Wasn\u0027t time to do a thing except what I did. I was just meanin\u0027 to scare the fella by firin\u0027 into the sky, and to get Mr. Earp\u0027s attention. But the gun went off. Just like that: boom.\" His eyes opened at the memory of the shot. \"Knocked me down, \u0027bout busted my shoulder. I heard the bullet ricochet off a rock about six inches from my right foot. That bullet went straight through the fella\u0027s gunhand wrist. Blew the pistol out of his hand, broke his wrist open so the edge of a bone was stickin\u0027 out. He bled like a fountain. and as he was bleedin\u0027 to death I was sayin\u0027, \u0027I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027m sorry.\u0027 \u0027Cause I didn\u0027t mean to kill anybody. I just meant to keep Mr. Earp from gettin\u0027 killed.\" He sighed, long and softly; it was like the sound of wind blowing dust over the graves on Boot Hill. \"I was standin\u0027 over the body, holdin\u0027 Billy Clanton\u0027s gun. Doc Holliday came up to me, and he gave me a four-bit piece and he said, \u0027Go buy yourself a candy stick, kid.\u0027 That\u0027s how I got the name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What namei\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Candystick Kid,\" Mr. Cathcoate answered. \"Mr. Earp came to my house to have dinner. My dad was a farmer. We didn\u0027t have much, but we fed Mr. Earp as best we could. He gave me Billy Clanton\u0027s gun and holster as a gift for savin\u0027 his life.\" Mr. Cathcoate shook his scraggly-maned head. \"I should\u0027ve thrown that damn gun down the well, like my momma wanted me to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whyi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Cause,\" he said, and here he seemed to get irritable and agitated, \"I liked it too much, that\u0027s why! I started learnin\u0027 how to use it! Started likin\u0027 its smell, and its weight, and how it felt warm in my hand after it had just gone off, and how that bottle I was aimin\u0027 at flew all to pieces in a heartbeat, that\u0027s why.\" He scowled as if he\u0027d just had a taste of bitter fruit. \"Started shootin\u0027 birds out of the sky, and believin\u0027 I was a quick-draw artist. Then it started workin\u0027 on my mind, wonderin\u0027 how fast I could be against some other boy with a gun. I kept practicin\u0027, kept slappin\u0027 that leather and pullin\u0027 that hogleg out time and again. and when I was sixteen years old I went to Yuma in a stagecoach and I killed a gunslinger there name of Edward Bonteel, and that\u0027s when I put a foot in hell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ol\u0027 Owen here got to be quite a name,\" Mr. Dollar said as he brushed the clipped hairs from Dad\u0027s shoulders. \"The Candystick Kid, I mean. How many fellas did you send to meet their Maker, Oweni\" Mr. Dollar looked at me and quickly winked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I killed fourteen men,\" Mr. Cathcoate said. There was no pride in his voice. \"Fourteen men.\" He stared at the red and black squares of the checkerboard. \"Youngest was nineteen. Oldest was forty-two. Maybe some of \u0027em deserved to die. Maybe that\u0027s not for me to say. I killed \u0027em, every one, in fair fights. But I was lookin\u0027 to kill \u0027em. I was lookin\u0027 to make a big name for myself, be a big man. The day I got shot by a younger, faster fella, I decided I was livin\u0027 on borrowed time. I cleared out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You got shoti\" I asked. \"Where\u0027d it hit youi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Left side. But I aimed better. Shot that fella through the forehead, smack dab. My gunfightin\u0027 days were over, though. I headed east. Wound up here. That\u0027s my story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still got that gun and holster, don\u0027t you, Candysticki\" Mr. Dollar inquired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Cathcoate didn\u0027t reply. He sat there, motionless. I thought he\u0027d gone to sleep, though his heavy-lidded eyes were still open. Then, abruptly, he stood up from his chair and walked on stiffened legs to where Mr. Dollar was standing. He pushed his face toward Mr. Dollar\u0027s, and I saw his expression in the mirror; Mr. Cathcoate\u0027s age-spotted face was grim and thin-lipped, like a skull bound up with brown leather. Mr. Cathcoate\u0027s mouth split open in a smile, but it was not a happy smile. It was a terrible smile, and I saw Mr. Dollar shrink back from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perry,\" Mr. Cathcoate said, \"I know you think I\u0027m an old fool half out of my head. I accept the fact that you laugh at me when you think I\u0027m not lookin\u0027. But if I didn\u0027t have eyes in the back of my head, Perry, I wouldn\u0027t be alive right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh... uh... why, no, Owen!\" Mr. Dollar blubbered. \"I\u0027m not laughin\u0027 at you! Honest!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now you\u0027re either lyin\u0027, or callin\u0027 me a liar,\" the old man said, and something about the soft way he said that made my bones grow cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m... sorry if you think I\u0027m-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I still have the gun and holster,\" Mr. Cathcoate interrupted him. \"I kept \u0027em for old time\u0027s sake. Now, you understand this, Perry.\" He leaned in closer, and Mr. Dollar tried to smile but he only summoned up a weak grin. \"You can call me Owen, or Mr. Cathcoate. You can call me Hey, you or Old Man. But you\u0027re not to call me by my gunfighter name. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever. Do we see eye to eye on that, Perryi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Owen, there\u0027s no call to be-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do we see eye to eyei\" Mr. Cathcoate repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh... yeah. We do. Sure.\" Mr. Dollar nodded. \"Whatever you say, Owen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not whatever I say. Just this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay. No problem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Cathcoate stared into Mr. Dollar\u0027s eyes for another few seconds, as if looking for the truth there. Then he said, \"I\u0027ll be leavin\u0027 now,\" and he walked to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about our game, Oweni\" the Jazzman asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Cathcoate paused. \"I don\u0027t want to play anymore,\" he said, and then he pushed through the door and out into the hot June afternoon. a wave of heat rolled in as the door settled shut. I stood up, went to the plate-glass window, and watched Mr. Cathcoate walking slowly up the sidewalk of Merchants Street, his hands in his pockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, what do you think about thati\" Mr. Dollar asked. \"What do you suppose set him offi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He knows you don\u0027t believe none of that story,\" the Jazzman said as he began to put away the checkers pieces and the board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it true, or noti\" Dad stood up from the chair. His ears had been lowered considerably, the back of his neck ruddy where it had been shaved and scrubbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Course it\u0027s not true!\" Mr. Dollar laughed with a snort. \"Owen\u0027s crazy! Been out of his head for years!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It didn\u0027t happen like he said it didi\" I kept watching Mr. Cathcoate move away up the sidewalk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. He made the whole thing up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know that for surei\" Dad asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, Tom! What would a Wild West gunfighter be doin\u0027 in Zephyri and don\u0027t you think it\u0027d be in the history books if a kid saved Wyatt Earp\u0027s life at the O.K. Corrali I went to the library and looked it up. ain\u0027t no mention of any kid savin\u0027 Wyatt Earp\u0027s life, and in this book I found about gunfighters there\u0027s nobody called the Candy-stick Kid, either.\" Mr. Dollar brushed hair out of the chair with furious strokes. \"Your turn, Cory. Get on up here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to move away from the window, but I saw Mr. Cathcoate wave to someone. Vernon Thaxter, naked as innocence, was walking on the other side of Merchants Street. Vernon was walking fast, as if he had somewhere important to go, but he lifted his hand in greeting to Mr. Cathcoate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two crazy men passed each other, going their separate ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t laugh. I wondered what it was that had made Mr. Cathcoate want to believe so badly that he\u0027d been a gunfighter, just as Vernon Thaxter believed he really had somewhere to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got up in the chair. Mr. Dollar pinned the barber towel around my neck, and he combed through my hair a few times as Dad sat down to read a Sports Illustrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Little bit off the top and thin the sides outi\" Mr. Dollar asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes sir,\" I said. \"That\u0027d be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scissors sang, and little dead parts of me flew off. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/boy-s-life/page-10.html","bookId":2471,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:45:00 PM"}
