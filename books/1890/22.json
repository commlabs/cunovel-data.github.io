What hotel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The one where you hired the private shopper.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one where he made me orgasm over and over—right. How had I forgotten that hotel? How had he remembered so well?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI blushed, thinking about it. He smiled, \"Yeah, that hotel.\" He looked funny, off a little. Like he was unsure how to be around me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and opened the door for him. He walked in and placed the bags on the bed, His eyes darted to my bag. \"So, uh… seven?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rubbed my eyes and climbed back onto the bed, pushing the bags over. \"Yeah, sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled the blankets up. He got up and walked to the far side of the room, \"You have a good flight?\" It was weird the way he said it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed, \"Whatever you\u0027re avoiding asking me, just do it. I\u0027m beat and we don’t do small talk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked like he might say something but he stopped himself short and shook his head. He looked a bit lost as he walked back over to the door, \"I need to go do something. I\u0027ll see you at dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever.” I waved and pulled the covers up over my face, \"Night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes and let the sleep claim me again. I woke to the alarm that I should have woken to an hour earlier. It was six, I had an hour to be hot. I dumped the bags on the bed and grabbed the shampoo and conditioner and frizz control he bought me. I stumbled into the bathroom and started the process of not looking like I was no longer caring about my looks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hot water was amazing and the idea of being in a hotel with France made me think about the last shower we had taken. I blushed, smiling and scrubbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got out, dialed Brandi and started changing into the sexy underwear and bra he\u0027d bought me. It was stunning and not the same as I had ordered last time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spoke softly, \"He has a girlfriend. An Italian-model girlfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandi sighed, \"I know. Will told me when I met up with him the other day. They\u0027re engaged, J.D. You need to home wreck on his ass and get this to end. Will thinks she\u0027s looking for a green card, rich-husband combo and Mike is so desperate to get over you that he\u0027s making this mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth was dry. I grabbed a bottle of the Swiss mineral water and guzzled it. I coughed, \"You sent me here, knowing he was engaged? Do you hate me, Bran?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Baby, I know you and him are meant to be. You need to tell him how you feel and don’t do your prim and proper bullshit. Belt it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, feeling faint. \"Okay. I hate you though. You and Will. You\u0027re dead to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe chuckled, \"That’s fine. Call me later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered. He was engaged—already? It had been six months since he asked me to run away with him. Asshole. I felt a bitterness creeping up inside of me. Not a jealous bitterness but an \u0027I want him jealous\u0027 bitterness. Fucker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled on the dress that he bought me, hiking it up a bit and adding the padding back into the push-up bra. I slid my feet into the patent-leather, black Versace pumps. My hair was in its natural state of curls, around my shoulders. The black dress was sexy with the harsh push-up of the bra. I looked classically beautiful. Not Italian-model beautiful, but I wasn’t going to beat myself up over that. She had to have flaws too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod was fair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lined my eye makeup on a little heavy and smoky, then ran anti-frizz product through my hair. I sprayed a touch of perfume and gave myself a final look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was good. He had done very well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy lips were red, nothing beat a strawberry-blonde with red lipstick. Not even an Italian model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left the room and made my way downstairs to the dining room. The maitre d’ brought me to my table. They weren’t there yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat and waited, perusing the wine list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled when I saw one of my favorites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I get you a drink to start?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made a face, \"It\u0027s going to seem presumptuous of me to order wine for the table, but I must have a bottle of the pinot noir. It was made by a vineyard in the Alto Adige region. I had tasted it when I had gone for the sommelier tasting. The region was well known for its pinot noir grapes. It had a history of thousands of years of winemaking and grape growing. I had found it fascinating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe server grinned, \"The lady knows her wine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, \"I do. I love wine. I actually spent a little time in Alto Adige, in Tirol and a few other places.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked taken aback, \"Wow. That is impressive. The area is so rich with wine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"It flows everywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, \"I will be back with your wine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat there alone until he came back with the bottle. He poured my taster. I smelled and drank, swishing it about in my mouth, and letting it get air in my mouth as I swallowed. I nodded, \"Perfect.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe poured me a full glass and looked around the room, \"Are you dining alone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"I\u0027m not supposed to be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned, \"Who are you waiting for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mike France.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scowled, \"Of course. Some of the others he plays with, the other foreigners are at that table there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed, \"You don’t like Mike?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked around discretely, \"I am a huge fan of his. That woman, Ms. Ribissi is another story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excellent. I think you and I will be great friends. Can I tell you a secret?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis dark eyes lit up, \"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m here to ruin their engagement.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face glowed, \"Oh, what a wonderful thing. You are here to save him from that money-grabbing man-eater?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a drink of my wine, \"No. I want him for myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This bottle is on the house. You dine for free. Wait until I tell the others, there is hope for him. We assumed it was the hits to the head that have made him stupid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and drank another big gulp. I wasn’t savoring my wine. I was chugging it. I needed liquid courage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Romeo, and if you need anything at all while you are here, you tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around, \"I don’t think they\u0027re coming. Can you introduce me to the other hockey players?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clapped his hands, \"Wonderful idea.\" He grabbed my bottle and glass and carried them over to their table in the corner. Six beefy guys sat there. They didn’t all look like hockey players, well, maybe one didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"May I introduce, Miss Jacqueline Croix. She is a friend to Mr. France. He has been delayed and she is dining alone tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir faces lit up. One guy smiled, \"Come sit with us, sweetheart.\" He sounded like he was from Texas maybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother guy with a German accent shoved his chair over, \"Sit next to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, \"Thank you. I didn’t want to sit alone.\" Actually, I wanted France to come in and see me with everyone else, let him be the awkward one. He and the model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat, nestled into the small group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Bill from Vermont, Sal from Germany, Luce from Israel, Daniel from Sweden, Arthur from Ireland, and I am Tex, from Texas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI waved, \"Jack or J.D.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTex gave me a squeeze, not realizing I hated being touched by other people. \"J.D., now that’s my kind of girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI laughed and let him keep his arm wrapped around me. I hoped that France would walk in, accidentally seeing me with another man touching me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course he didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe started drinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So Jack, where are you from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the eager faces of the men, \"New York.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did he just call you Jack?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned around to see France standing behind us, alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, \"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, \"Her name is J.D. or Jacqueline. No one calls her Jack, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all stopped for a second and then instantly started laughing. His face got red.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around at the laughing men. Arthur from Ireland nodded, \"You\u0027re that Jack. Shit, I thought you were bisexual, France.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMike\u0027s face got even worse. He put a hand out for me, \"Can I talk to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head, \"Where\u0027s Daniela?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Upstairs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is she coming down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, \"No. Can you guys excuse us?\" He tossed down a hundred-dollar bill. I grimaced, \"That’s not enough for the bottle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pulled me from my chair, \"Tex, you got the rest of that bill?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrance dragged me out of the dining room. I pulled my arm from his grip, \"What are you doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paced for a minute and then pulled me down the hall to the elevator. He pressed the button, \"Why did you come here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe elevator arrived, but before I could answer, he pushed me inside and against the wall. His face was savage as he reached inside of his pocket, ripping the pink bachelorette sash from his pants. I frowned for a second, \"Did you go through my bag?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held it in my face, \"How did you get this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoved him back, \"I went to Empire State Building that night, you meathead. I went to the train station, your apartment, your house in Jersey, my house, the coffee house we once accidentally made out in, and then it dawned on me. The Empire State Building. Of course. The place that would show me you loved me, more than anything in the whole world. I paid the sax player two thousand dollars for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clenched his jaw, \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shoved him again, \"Because I wanted your fucking signature. Why do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pounded the wall of the elevator, \"Why are you doing this to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI jumped, feeling my lip quiver. He was angry in a way I had never seen before. He closed his eyes, \"Why did you come here? Because I finally met someone? Because I was finally happy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt my nostrils flare, \"Firstly, you\u0027ve known her like a week. Finally happy—my ass. You are rebounding on that poor girl. Secondly, you really believe that I would come here just to sabotage your engagement? How was I supposed to know you were engaged, dick?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-long-way-home/page-22.html","bookId":1890,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:03:38 PM"}
