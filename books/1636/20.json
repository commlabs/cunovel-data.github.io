He had seen them tear enemies in half with their \"hands\" while in the midst of a mindless blood rage, and afterward pause to recite war poetry. How could any truly understand the Lekgolo? Inside their thick armor swarmed orange worms—a colony gestalt as alien as anything Voro had ever encountered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore pragmatically, they were indestructible—at least to Voro with his one pistol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLekgolo armor could withstand multiple plasma bolts before even warming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVoro stood tall and unapoiogetic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Lekgolo stared at him. Their forms shuddered and the eel 2 Lekgolo: the Elite name for the Hunter race colonies pulsed in harmonic unison to produce a subsonic rumble, words that were more felt than actually heard. \"A mercy kill,\" they said together. \"You have done the Ship Master an honor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVoro resumed breathing. They were his now to command and to send into battle. As was the Reverence-class cruiser Incorruptible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does anyone else have words about this?\" Voro asked his bridge officers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey looked to one another.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eY\u0027gar, the eldest bridge officer, stepped forward.

He had refused to have the cataract repaired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tano was devout to the end,\" Y\u0027gar said. \"But his reasoning, in light of recent events, was not sound. This was regrettable, but necessary… Ship Master.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere it was: Voro was Master now. All the honor his. All the responsibility his as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced at Tano, spilling his lifeblood over the command console, and set a hand on his mentor\u0027s shoulder, a parting gesture. \"Remove him,\" Voro whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eY\u0027gar made a chuffing sound and three Unggoy3 appeared and carried Tano off the bridge, sponging up the remains as they went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVoro knocked one with a cleaning rag aside. \"Let his blood remain there,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Unggoy scurried away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe stain would forever remain on Voro\u0027s soul; it could stay on the deck as well, a reminder of the price he had paid for their survival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVoro then stared at the central holographic viewer: at the insanity that surrounded the Incorruptible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3 Unggoy: the Elite name for the Grunt race The Second Fleet of Homogeneous Clarity was in chaos; more than a hundred ships maneuvered on random vectors, barely avoiding collisions, and in the distance the silver arc of the Forerunner Halo construct—ominous, breathtaking, and the source of this trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had made Ship Master Tano lose his mind. He belonged to a fringe sect, the Governors of Contrition, who believed all Forerunner creations were sacrosanct. This even applied to the parasitic Flood infestation on Halo. Tano had reasoned that the Forerunners had created a perfect life-form, and it was therefore their duty to protect, even embrace, it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had ordered the Incorruptible closer to the Halo ring to allow the disease aboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would never occur while Voro breathed. The Flood was an infection that had to be cleansed. There was nothing remotely \"holy\" about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Incorruptible shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plasma on the port lateral shield,\" Uruo Losonaee said, leaning over his OPS station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis strained voice betrayed that he had only recently been initiated in combat. \"Successfully deflected, but the shield has collapsed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hull reverberated once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Strike on the aft shield,\" Uruo said. \"It\u0027s holding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One-third power forward,\" Voro said. \"Roll to present starboard shields.\" He turned to Zasses on NAV. \"Trace those firing solutions and get me a target!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Calculating, sir,\" Zasses said. \"Solution obtained. Two targets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA holographic frigate pair appeared on the deck and sped toward them: the Tenebrous and the Twilight Compunction, commanded by the alpha Jiralhanae4, Gargantum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was Voro\u0027s other problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4 Jiralhanae: the Elite name for the Brute race In the confusion caused by the departing Prophets, the Sangheili\u0027s ancient feud with the Jiralhanae had escalated into xenocide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe frigate pair moved as one, accelerating, their lateral lines warmed, and released a second salvo of plasma that arced toward the Incorruptible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maneuver one two zero by zero seven five,\" Voro shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coming about,\" Zasses answered, and the stars wheeled through the holographic view space. \"Sir, that places the carrier Lawgiver between us and them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The Lawgiver has fully generated lateral shields,\" Voro growled. \"They can take the hit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe frigate pair split to miss the carrier in their flight path. The enemy ships, and their plasma torpedoes, became obscured by the bulk of the sleek carrier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Heat lines four and seven,\" Voro ordered, \"and prepare to target the Tenebrous as it emerges from the carrier\u0027s shadow.

Voro could not afford to merely wound one of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe edges of the Lawgiver\u0027s shield shimmered, dispersing the plasma into fiery wisps— an inconvenience for them… a Hfe-saving maneuver for the Incorruptible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jiralhanae frigate attack pair appeared, one over and one under the carrier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fire all lines,\" Voro ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lights on the bridge dimmed as plasma heated and flowed from their lateral banks and arced forward in two bloody streaks across the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Counter guiding signals detected!\" Y\u0027gar shouted. \"Attempt-ing to disrupt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plasma blots drifted back and forth and diffused into smears in a signal tug-of-war between them and the Jiralhanae. Voro had not anticipated they had such abilities. Stolen, no doubt… so they wouldn\u0027t know all the system\u0027s intricacies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Reprogram to home in on their signal lock,\" Voro said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Y\u0027gar murmured, and his hands moved algorithm blocks over this console. \"Lock reestablished on new signal,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir plasma smoothed, concentrated—and accelerated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Jiralhanae frigate turned into their shot, presenting a smaller target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA desperate maneuver and not quick enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe frigate\u0027s shield heated, dispersing the first bolt of superheated ionized gas.

It lit the space around the battle, a cleansing illumination. The Tenebrous appeared frozen in time for a moment… before the energy tore through its hull, blasting internal decks to atoms— amidships, and then the aft plasma coils—shattering the ship into a haze of glowing particles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe surviving Jiralhanae frigate, the Twilight Compunction, however, was untouched… and it continued toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Recycling engine power,\" Zasses said. \"Fifteen seconds until engine back online.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifteen seconds could be a lifetime in a close-quarter space battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Depressurize Seraph launch bay fourteen,\" Voro shouted. \"Dump plasma from auxiliary coils into the lateral lines.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plasma diverted,\" Uruo answered, his face flushing purple. \"Emergency depressurization—now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tremble ran through the ship as the bay vented.
