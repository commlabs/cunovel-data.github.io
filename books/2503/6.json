{"id":106735,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\u003cp\u003eHyacinthie\u0027s laughter quickly gave way to tears as she held up the package her uncle had given her: the small box contained an exquisite portrait cameo of her dead mother, certainly valuable as jewelry as well as a memento, but it seemed nothing more than a trivial thing, given the manner in which he had presented it-leaving it on her breakfast plate with only a length of embroidery floss to secure it. She flung herself down on her bed and let herself give way to her roiling emotions. \"How could he?\" she demanded of the thick goose-down comforter that lay folded at the foot. Pressing her face against the glossy satin, she pretended to muffle her sobs. The presentation note that accompanied the brooch dropped from her fingers and seemed to mock her from where it lay on the carpet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy dear niece,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the occasion of your entering the age of marriage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour uncle and guardian\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evon Ravensberg\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was bad enough to be eighteen, but to be reminded so callously that she was single was intolerable. This rebuke-for it could be nothing less than a rebuke-was the harshest he had given her in four years of increasing rejection. How dare he slight her? Had he not pledged his devotion to her a decade ago? Had she been a fool to believe him; he had changed so much in the last four years that she felt she no longer knew him, nor he her. Now she sighed and put her hands together, her face stinging from her concentration and tears, and rolled onto her side, as guileless as a child. She wanted to strike back at him for this dreadful insult. Studying the patterns painted on the ceiling beams, she let herself contemplate how she might best be revenged on Uncle Wallache. One notion took her fancy and she smiled ferociously, certain she had hit upon the very thing that might wound him as deeply as he had wounded her: she should ask him to find her a suitor, someone rich and powerful, someone who would care for her as her uncle had when she was younger, someone who would devote himself to her pleasure and contentment. Then let him try to be indifferent to her. She let this happy notion carry her thoughts to far more pleasant realms than she had been dealing with. Her face softened again, and the hint of a smile that touched her mouth was no longer predatory, but tantalizing. Yes, she would have a suitor, and she would lead him a merry dance; Uncle Wallache would ache with Jealousy and need, and she would not feel anything but amusement at his plight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat up and looked at the brooch again. Had her mother really looked like that? Her memory was uncertain: there was a resemblance, she was almost sure of it. On impulse she rose and took a fichu from her chest-of-drawers, pulled it around her shoulders, and secured it with the brooch. For a minute or two, she regarded herself in the mirror over her wash-basin, then nodded her approval. To complete her toilette, she took her bottle of violet cologne and daubed her temples and wrists with the fragrant liquid. With a deliberate little giggle, she flounced out of her room and went in search of her uncle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA quick search of the Schloss brought her to Herr Arndt Lowengard\u0027s office behind the library, where she found her uncle and his man-of-business deep in conversation. She stood in the half-open door, waiting to be noticed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"-should arrive tomorrow or the next day: two sisters, Lowengard, six and eight. Rosalie and Hedda. They are cousins of my late wife, their parents are dead, and I know it is my duty to take them in.\" He chuckled, a dry sound, like pebbles underfoot. \"I can\u0027t very well let the nuns have them, can I?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The provisions here are most generous for indigent relatives,\" Lowengard remarked as he looked at the page in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is expected of me. Girls need protection that boys do not require. Their brother will manage for himself.\" He rubbed the lapel of his Italian robe. \"Rosalie and Hedda. We must make them welcome.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom her place in the door, Hyacinthie curled her hands into fists, nails digging into her palms like claws. Two girls coming? Indigent cousins? She wanted to scream but forced a smile onto her face and giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth men looked up. \"Hyacinthie,\" said her uncle. \"I didn\u0027t know you were there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe broadened her smile painfully. \"I wanted to thank you for this brooch. It is so beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good of you,\" he said, losing interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe decided to take a chance. \"You said something about two cousins?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wouldn\u0027t know them. My late wife\u0027s cousins, once removed-their father was my wife\u0027s cousin germane, so you and they are not related at all,\" von Ravensberg corrected, losing patience with his ward. \"They will arrive in a day or two. I expect you to welcome them as your sisters. Keep in mind that they are in mourning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course,\" she said, bobbing a curtsy, because she knew it was expected of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need something more to occupy your time than what Frau Schale gives you to study. These two girls will be just what\u0027s wanted, filling your hours and preparing you for the married state and motherhood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHyacinthie stared. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVon Ravensberg sighed and explained. \"You have to think about your future, dear niece. What is going to become of you when you are twenty if you have no skills at those many offices that an intelligent man demands of his wife? I am in no position to continue to house you as a dependent, and your other relatives have daughters of their own to see established in the world. So it is fitting that you take advantage of the presence of these girls in order to show your aptitude for woman\u0027s most sacred role: motherhood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was too much for Hyacinthie to take in, but she continued to smile. \"Then you will find me a suitor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And a husband, I should hope,\" said von Ravensberg, his voice filled with purpose. \"I won\u0027t have you dwindling into a spinster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dozen retorts filled Hyacinthie\u0027s thoughts, but she said none of them. \"I want to be married, Uncle Wallache.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good; good,\" said von Ravensberg, motioning her away from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLowengard\u0027s neck and ears had turned deep red as he listened; now he coughed as if to remind the two of his presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVon Ravensberg took the hint. \"So run away now, Hyacinthie, and let my man-of-business and me deal with the details of taking on the two girls. Take a turn about the garden, if you like. It is a fine day. I will see you at dinner.\" Saying that, he put his hand on Lowengard\u0027s shoulder. \"We must be sure all is in order by the time the two arrive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLowengard ducked his head. \"As you say, von Ravensberg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, good. You remembered this time. Titles were what got so many high-born Frenchmen killed, a generation since. You may call me Professor, if you prefer, but von Ravensberg truly suffices. I cannot have all of us lost in the past.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Lowengard as the sycophant he was; he drew out another sheet of paper and handed it to von Ravensberg. \"If you will review this? It is the same, but for Hedda, not Rosalie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHyacinthie let herself out of the room as silently as possible. Her thoughts were in tumult, and she could not hold any one of them clearly for long. She hurried to the side door and let herself out into the walled garden, where flowers and herbs grew in profusion. It was warm in the sunlight but still a bit cool in the shadows, as if winter were touching summer, and the wind off the distant snowy peaks carried the promise of an early return to cold. Below the white, cloudy crests the mountains loomed around them, purple-blue in the hazy light. A large stand of rosemary stopped her, its small purple blossoms adding to the strong fragrance of the needlelike leaves. Ordinarily she would have enjoyed the odor, but now she slapped at the stalks with her fist, trying to break them. June twenty-third was supposed to be a happy day-her day. Now this. \"Cousins!\" she cried. \"Rosalie and Hedda. Six and eight. And he takes them in for charity!\" She felt an insect on her hand and angrily flung it away. \"He took me in for charity, and he has discarded me!\" Making her way down the flagged path, she stopped at the fountain-not yet spouting water due to damage on its mechanism during the winter-and scooped the shriveled brown leaves out of it stone embrace. \"He told me to run away,\" she mused as she sniffed at this ugly melange. \"I wonder if I should?\" Surely, she thought, he would have to come and find me, and the two girls would be left to fend for themselves. Surely he wouldn\u0027t put them before her. But she could not forget how he had ceased to visit her, and had been more and more occupied with his work. Would he be glad she was gone, and give all his attention to Rosalie and Hedda? Would he even notice she was missing? He\u0027d probably be relieved not to have to care for her anymore, especially not with two children to hold his attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of the kitchen bell caught her attention: dinner would be ready in half an hour. She let herself pout, thinking this would be the last day she would have to herself. It bothered her to contemplate her future, girls and all. She realized she had to find a suitor, and one who would command Uncle Wallache\u0027s respect, and it had to be done before the cousins were too deeply sunk in her uncle\u0027s affections. Hyacinthie\u0027s face felt taut, as if her skin had been shrunken tightly over her bones. \"He must take care of me!\" she declared. \"He must!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe banging of doors on the far side of the garden announced that the servants were leaving the cow-barn for the Schloss; the sound of their voices drifted over the wall. She recognized Adelinde, the oldest of the three milkmaids, who was recounting some village scandal to her to companions. They seemed so contented, Hyacinthie thought, as though they had not a care in the world but to titter over a rumor. What must it be like, to have nothing to worry you? She contemplated that happy state as she wandered back through the garden, letting the dessicated leaves from the fountain dribble through her fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe small dining room seemed uncomfortably warm; the fireplace was filled with pine logs that spat and filled the air with the scent of burning sap. Von Ravensberg sat at the head of the table, a large glass of white wine by his plate, his elegant jacket protected by the spread of his napkin from his neck to his lap. He nodded to Hyacinthie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good afternoon, Uncle Wallache,\" she said at her meekest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And to you, my girl. Sit down.\" He beamed at her. \"I trust you\u0027re pleased to have company coming?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallowed her indignation and said, \"I should think so, Uncle. I have had you and my governess for tutors for so many years, I hardly know what to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Frau Schale will help you, if you have questions.\" He looked up as a platter of buttered turnips with sliced cabbage was carried in. \"Ah. Excellent.\" After he helped himself to a generous portion, he offered the serving spoon to Hyacinthie. \"Good German food, my girl. Make the most of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, Uncle,\" she said as she chose a small amount of the dish and set the spoon back on the platter with care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Later this summer, I plan to take you on a journey westward. There is someone in Trier I want you to meet-not that he is entirely a stranger-and then we must call upon my publisher in Amsterdam.\" He beamed with self-satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHyacinthie let out a little shriek. \"Amsterdam!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, yes. Eclipse Press has accepted my manuscript on blood. It is a great day for me-a great day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to scream it\u0027s my day, too! but the words stuck in her chest and she only touched her cameo brooch as she brought forth a little sigh. \"Congratulations, Uncle. When did you find out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The messenger who came two days ago brought me an offer. Yesterday I penned an acceptance of terms, so in two weeks or so I may expect a formal contract.\" He began to consume his turnips-and-cabbage, still talking as he chewed. \"This is a most encouraging development. I have no doubt it will lead to wide acceptance of my findings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How ... how splendid,\" she said, her head buzzing with hidden fury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is, it is.\" He continued to eat with gusto. \"I have to tell you, my girl, that this is the very opportunity I have sought for years. I am beside myself with enthusiasm.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s wonderful, Uncle Wallache,\" she said listlessly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And coming at just such a time! It is as if my life has emerged from obscurity into renown and delight.\" He reached over and patted her hand. \"Now, if only I can get you properly established in the world, at least one obligation will be behind me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you will have two more obligations,\" she said, so sweetly that none of her malice showed in her voice or on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"True, true. It befits a man of my position to assume these responsibilities.\" He took a long draught of wine. \"If the weather improves, I may soon restock the wine-cellar. It is time we had some decent vintages laid down again. I anticipate the need to entertain once my work is read in the academic community.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Uncle,\" she said softly and tried to choke down her food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWerther brought in a tureen of soup, this one made of sausage and chicken meat with herbs and onions. He set this down and got the wide bowls from the cupboard, removed the first-course dishes from the chargers, and set down the bowls, then fetched the spoons. He left the first course in case either von Ravensberg or his ward should want more of it. With a little bow, he left them alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The soup seems especially good today,\" von Ravensberg announced as he reached for the handsome Baroque ladle. \"Let me have your bowl, Hyacinthie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eObediently she handed it to him, and watched as he all but filled it with the soup. \"There. Hold it carefully; it\u0027s hot.\" He had issued the same warning every day for the last eleven years, but she nodded as if she had heard it for the first time; he continued as he always had: \"Mind you have bread with it. The strength is in the bread with the meat, not the meat alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Uncle Wallache,\" she said, and dutifully took a slice of bread from the basket at arm\u0027s-length down the table. She knew it would taste of straw as she spread a little fresh-churned butter on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These two girls-they\u0027re going to need a lot of attention from you. They have lost much. You know what it\u0027s like, becoming an orphan suddenly.\" He smacked his lips as he poured out soup for himself. \"I depend upon you. Yes, I depend upon you, to shepherd them through their first months here. Let them benefit from your experience, if you will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose I can,\" she said, imagining her uncle in the girls\u0027 beds already.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Calm their little fears, keep them from ... from making fools of themselves. They may be disconcerted for a time, and you may spare them difficulties.\" He took the largest slice of bread and slathered it well. \"You know how it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said tonelessly; when she had told the minister\u0027s wife what her uncle did to her at night, when she was nine, the minister had beaten her for lying and ingratitude. Perhaps she could spare the girls that humiliation. Much as she did not want them here, she did not want them exposed to such degradation even more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good; good.\" He consumed a good portion of soup, finally saying, \"This journey to Amsterdam-you will need a few new gowns for it. I will arrange for you to visit Frau Amergau for a fitting some day next week, so she will have them ready in time for your travels. You\u0027ll want a walking-dress, a morning-dress, a calling-dress, and something for fancy occasions. I can\u0027t have my ward presenting a shabby appearance, not if I intend to marry her well. I might even provide for a dancing-master, so you may participate in the balls in Trier and Amsterdam.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you, Uncle,\" she said, despising herself for feeling grateful to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Accept Constanz Medoc and I will consider it money well-spent.\" He drank more wine, apparently unaware of her widen eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Constanz Medoc?\" she burst out, her eyes filling with tears. \"The one who came here two years ago?\" She didn\u0027t add the old man, for he was more than forty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes; yes.\" Von Ravensberg nodded. \"A very good man, my girl.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he\u0027s bald!\" Hyacinthie sobbed, trying to express her repugnance without exposing herself to her uncle\u0027s disdain. \"And he smells of snuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s bald because he thinks so much. He is a most upstanding man, with an excellent reputation, one he has worked hard to establish and maintain. He is a very well-respected scholar, one whose work is known throughout Europe. He has been searching for a wife, a woman to ornament his life and tend to his pleasure. He is of an age when he wants children to carry on his name. His expectations are reasonable; the wildness of his youth is gone.\" He stopped, staring at her. \"But you seem distressed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I am!\u0027 She pushed back from the table and lurched to her feet. \"I don\u0027t like him, Uncle Wallache.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know him, my child. No doubt you have dreamed of a handsome young man who will carry you away to the city. Cities are dangerous places, and handsome young men have poor judgment in such matters. You are trying to suit your dreams to your life, and that is most unwise.\" He patted the table next to her place. \"Sit down; sit down. You\u0027re overwrought. I oughtn\u0027t to have told you all this so suddenly.\" He waited while she complied. \"You won\u0027t have to marry him if you truly dislike him. But you will have to marry someone, and you may decide, after you have a look at the world, that there are many worse men than Herr Medoc, for all his father was a Frenchman. I am in no position to keep you around here forever, and I will not have my niece working as a governess or a tutor. You know how that would reflect upon me, to have you earn your living. That would abash the family. So. A year from now at most, if you have not made another choice, I will accept Herr Medoc\u0027s very gracious offer for your hand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how can I find anyone else?\" she wailed. \"Ravensberg is leagues away from anything!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps in Amsterdam, or in one of the cities during our travels, you will find a man who suits you, and who is willing to marry you; I will do my utmost to see you have the opportunities you seek,\" he said without any suggestion of confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to stop the tears from falling, and very nearly succeeded. \"Thank you, Uncle Wallache,\" she told him demurely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must be realistic, my girl,\" he said sympathetically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no fortune and you are my only real connection,\" she recited, repeating the phrase he had told her regularly since she was seven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right.\" He glowered at her as he spooned up the soup, then broke off sections of bread and began to sop up the broth. \"You don\u0027t want to end up on the shelf. I have nothing to leave you, and I cannot continue to support you-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not with Rosalie and Hedda coming,\" she interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly.\" He popped a bit of soaked bread into this mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mustn\u0027t think that I mean you any harm, of course,\" he went on as he chewed. \"But there are limits. Perhaps, if my work is well-received, I will be able to provide a stipend for the youngsters, but I doubt I can afford to do it for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see,\" she said, very coolly now that she had mastered her outrage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded to her. \"You sit down and finish your dinner. You don\u0027t have to decide everything right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not with the girls coming,\" she said, too brightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I have set two of the maids to preparing rooms for them, down the hall from mine.\" He dropped his spoon into the small puddle of soup at the bottom of his bowl. \"I\u0027m going to have to assign one of the maids to them permanently, so you will have to share Idune with them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you wish.\" She moved her soup-bowl aside, its contents largely untouched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVon Ravensberg persevered. \"I know you\u0027ll be courteous with them. These accommodations need not be an occasion for distress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Certainly not,\" she said, planning to discover how to reclaim her one privilege-her maid-from the cousins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached for the bell, ringing it emphatically. \"They say they have trout today for our fish, with potatoes in a Dutch sauce.\" He studied her for several seconds, as if truly seeing her for the first time. \"Your appetite is lacking, my girl. You should eat something more than those nibbles you\u0027ve had.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blinked. \"I suppose you\u0027re right,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll have a good portion of fish,\" she assured him, wishing she could vanish from the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWerther appeared in the door. \"Are you ready for the fish?\" he asked. \"It is ready to be served.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That and another glass of wine,\" said von Ravensberg. \"And bring a small glass for my niece. It is her Natal Day, and she is now a woman. She should have wine when I do. But no beer. Gentlewomen should not drink beer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nein, von Ravensberg,\" said Werther.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled his approval. \"Is it truly trout we\u0027re having?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So I am told. With potatoes, bacon, and Dutch sauce.\" He picked up the platter of turnips-and-cabbage. \"You\u0027ll want more bread, too, I see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Soon, lad, soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Graf-\" He stopped himself. \"Von Ravensberg,\" he corrected himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly,\" said von Ravensberg as the under-chef let himself out of the smaller dining room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you for ordering wine for me, Uncle Wallache,\" Hyacinthie said, suspicious of his sudden magnanimity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is time you learned how to behave as a woman. A sensible man expects to have a sensible wife.\" Von Ravensberg coughed once. \"You must not cause disgrace to me and our family by your conduct, which means you must establish how much wine you may safely drink.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" she said, lethargy coming over her again like a pall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You owe me that much, my girl-not to bring a poor opinion upon me through your carelessness. I have housed and clothed and fed you since you were seven when no other relative would do so.\" He rapped his knuckles on the table. \"You don\u0027t realize how the world is. Every aspect of your behavior reflects upon me as your guardian. Never forget that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t,\" she promised, and looked toward the door where Werther was returning with a basket of bread, a bottle of pale-yellow wine, and a tulip-shaped glass along with a large covered platter of what smelled like fish. \"I will never forget you, Uncle Wallache,\" she vowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eText of a letter from Klasse van der Boom, printer and publisher, Eclipse Press, in Amsterdam, to Saint-Germain Ragoczy, Comte Franciscus at Chateau Ragoczy near Lake Geneva, Yvoire, Switzerland; carried by private messenger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the most excellent Comte Franciscus, the greetings of Klasse van der Boom in Amsterdam on this, the 21stday of July, 1817:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy very dear Comte,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHerewith find my account of sales from January to the end of June. As you can see, sales are up and averaging eight percent per title, which is a most encouraging sign. I am hoping you will agree to another expansion of our publication list, and a larger initial printrun for the three titles I have indicated have enjoyed the greatest sales of the last year, for I believe we may rely upon those titles to continue to sell and to attract more readers to these books. I have broken down the reported sales by month, as much as that can be determined, and by country, so that you may better appreciate where the interests of our readers lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must also inform you that the new presses of your own design will be delivered next month, and I remind you that you have expressed the desire to be here to supervise their installation. This would please me not only for the opportunity it will provide for us to speak again, but to make certain that the presses are working to your specifications and satisfaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe summer has been fairly cool thus far, and I would think you need not worry that you will encounter oppressive heat in your travels, but I urge you to discuss with your coachman the requirements you may have for travel in a day. This may be summer, and the days may be long, but it is also the time when footpads and highwaymen are most active. Be sure you do not find yourself on the road at sundown, or be prepared to fight all manner of thieves for your possessions. Since Napoleon is no longer a menace, many of his men, left portionless in the world, have taken to outlawry as a means of preserving body and soul. This, above the usual criminals who prey on travelers. I would not like to see your profits lost to paying your ransom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as the time of your arrival is generally known, I will bespeak rooms for you at whichever hotel suits your purposes most completely. Your courier will also be received with hospitality, and I will take it upon myself to ensure his entertainment. You have only to inform me what concerts and balls you would like to attend and I will see you have the proper invitations. If there is any event you would like to sponsor, I will be honored to put it in motion, if you will let me know what you seek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet me address one other point to you: Graf von Ravensberg has declared he will come to Amsterdam to review the pages of his book prior to publication, as he has been afforded the opportunity to do. If you have any desire to meet him, I will find out what his plans are in this regard, and make arrangements for such an engagement. If you would rather not meet this man, then tell me, and I will see that no such encounter occurs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelieve me to be ever at your service,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKlasse van der Boom\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eprinter and publisher\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEclipse Press\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmsterdam\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eenclosures: accounts as described above \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/borne-in-blood-saint-germain-20/page-6.html","bookId":2503,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:03:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:03:05 PM"}
