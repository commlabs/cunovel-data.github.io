It originated somewhere beyond the rocks and trees ahead, surged up between the horns of a large U-shaped construct, and raced into the sky where the planet Threshold served as a pastel backdrop. Was the pulse some sort of beacon? Part of what held the ring world together? There was no way for him to know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCortana had already warned the Spartan that a group of Marines had crash- landed in the area, so he wasn’t surprised to hear the rattle of automatic weapons fire or the characteristic whine as Covenant energy weapons answered in kind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe eased his way through the scrub and onto the hillside above the U-shaped edifice and the blocky structures that surrounded it. He could see a group of Grunts, Jackals, and Elites dashing back and forth as they tried to overwhelm a group of Marines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than charge in, assault weapon blazing, the Master Chief chose to use his M6D pistol instead. He raised the weapon, activated the 2X magnification, and took careful aim. A series of well-placed shots knocked a trio of Grunts off their feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore the Covenant forces could locate where the incoming fire had originated, the Master Chief opened fire on a blue-armored Elite. It took a full magazine to put the warrior down, but it beat the hell out of going toe- to-toe with the alien when there wasn’t any need to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe quick, unexpected sniping attack gave the Marines the opportunity they needed. There was a quick flurry of fire as the Spartan made his way down the slope, paused to strip some plasma grenades off a dead Grunt, and was welcomed by a friendly private. “Good to see you, Chief. Welcome to the party.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spartan’s reply was a curt nod. “Where’s your CO, Private?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Back there,” the Marine said. He turned and called over his shoulder. “Hey, Sarge!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief recognized the tough-looking Sergeant who trotted to join them. He’d last seen Sergeant Johnson during a search-and-destroy run aboard one of Reach’s orbital docking facilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s your status here, Sergeant?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a mess,” Johnson growled. “We’re scattered all over this valley.” He paused, and added in a quiet voice, “We called for evac, but until you showed up, I thought we were done for.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry,” Cortana said over the Spartan’s external speakers, “we’ll stay here till evac arrives. I’ve been in touch with AI Wellsley. The Helljumpers are in the process of taking over some Covenant real estate—and one of the Pelicans has been dispatched to pick you up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Glad to hear it,” Johnson replied. “Some of my people need medical attention.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Here comes another Covenant dropship,” the Private put in. “It’s time to roll out the welcome mat!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, Bisenti,” Johnson barked. “Re-form the squad. Let’s get to work.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief looked up and saw that the Marine was correct—another Covenant landing craft hovered for a moment, then dropped close to the ground. The oddly shaped vehicle dipped slightly, and the mandible structures that formed the bulk of the dropship’s fuselage hinged open. A clutch of Grunts and an Elite dropped to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief moved fifty meters to the right, and raised his pistol once again. In seconds, a team of Marines poured fire into the Covenant LZ and flushed them out. As the aliens scattered and dove for cover, the Spartan put them down one by one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a brief respite, and the Master Chief paused to survey the situation. Cortana pulled up the Marine positions, tagged them asFIRE TEAM C , and highlighted their locations on his HUD. Several of them had climbed the large structure that dominated the area, and the rest patrolled the perimeter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had just readied his assault rifle when a Marine voice called out:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Contact! Enemy dropship sighted! They’re trying to flank us!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeconds later, the Spartan’s motion sensor painted a contact—a large one— nearby. He stayed close to a large boulder and used it for cover, then cautiously checked for targets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dropship disgorged another contingent of troops—including a trio of Jackals. Their distinctive, glowing shields flared as Sergeant Johnson’s men opened fire. Bullets ricocheted as the birdlike aliens crouched behind their protective devices, like medieval footmen forming a shield wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind them, more Grunts and a blue Elite spread out in an enveloping formation. It was a good tactic, particularly if there were more dropships inbound. Eventually, the Covenant would wear down the Marine defenses and overrun the position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was just one problem with their plan: He was in a perfect flanking position. He crouched, then sprinted forward into the Jackal’s line. His assault rifle barked and bullets tore into the exposed aliens. They had barely hit the ground as the Spartan spun, primed a captured plasma grenade, and threw it at the Elite, almost thirty meters away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe alien only had time to roar in surprise before the glowing plasma orb struck him in the center of his helmet. The weapon fused to the alien’s helmet and began to pulse a sickly blue-white. A moment later, as the alien attempted to tear off his helmet, the grenade detonated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter that it was a relatively simple matter for the Master Chief to move through the ruins and hunt down the remainder of the Covenant reaction force.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA welcome voice sounded from his radio receiver. “This is Echo 419. Does anyone read me? Repeat: any UNSC personnel, respond.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCortana was quick to reply on the same frequency. “Roger, Echo 419, we read you. This is Fire Team Charlie. Is that you, Foehammer?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Roger, Fire Team Charlie,” Foehammer drawled, “it’s good to hear from you!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a distant rumbling, and the Master Chief turned to identify the source of the noise. In the distance, he saw movement—lifeboats, trailing smoke and fire as their friction-heated hulls tore through the atmosphere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re coming in fast,” Cortana warned. “If they make it down, the Covenant will be right on top of them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chief nodded. “Then we should find them first.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Foehammer, we need you to disengage your Warthog. The Master Chief and I are going to see if we can save some soldiers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Roger.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Pelican rounded the spire of the alien structure, circled the area once, then hovered above the crest of a nearby hill. Slung beneath the Pelican was a four-wheeled vehicle—an M12 LRV Warthog. The light reconnaissance vehicle hung beneath the dropship for a moment, then dropped to the ground as Foehammer released it from her craft. The Warthog bounced once on its heavy suspension, slid five meters down the hill, then was still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay, Fire Team Charlie—one Warthog deployed,” Foehammer said. “Saddle up and give ’em hell!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Roger, Foehammer, stand by to load survivors and evac them to safety.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s affirmative . . . Foehammer out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the Marines sprinted for the Pelican, the Master Chief made his way to the Warthog. The all-terrain vehicle was mounted with a standard M41 light antiaircraft gun, or LAAG. The weapon fired five hundred rounds of 12.7X99mm armor-piercing rounds per minute and was effective on both ground and airborne targets. The vehicle was capable of carrying up to three soldiers, and one Marine had already taken his place behind the gun. His rank and ID scrolled across the Spartan’s display:PFC .FITZGERALD ,M .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Chief!” Fitzgerald said. “Sergeant Johnson said you could use a gunner.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spartan nodded. “That’s right, Private. There’s two boatloads of Marines on the far side of that ridge, and we’re going after them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFitzgerald pulled the gun’s charging lever back toward his chest, and released it with a metallic snap. A shell slipped into the first of the weapon’s three barrels. “I’m your man, Chief! Let’s roll.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief pulled himself up behind the wheel, started the engine, and strapped himself into the seat. The engine roared and the wheels kicked up geysers of dirt. The Warthog accelerated to the top of a rise, caught some air, and landed with a spine-jarring thump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I put a nav indicator on your HUD,” Cortana said, “just follow the arrow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Figures,” the Spartan said, a hint of amusement in his level voice. “You always were a backseat driver.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrue to the aircraft’s nickname, Keyes heard the Banshee long before he actually caught a glimpse of the attack aircraft. The alien pilot had them on his sensors—Keyes was sure of that—and it wouldn’t be long before another team dropped out of the sky in an attempt to root them out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hills, which had seemed so welcoming when the command party first landed, had been transformed into a hellish landscape where the humans scuttled from one rocky crevice to the next, always on the run, and never allowed to rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had faced capture on three different occasions, but each time Corporal Wilkins and his Marines had managed to blow a hole in the Covenant’s tightening net and lead the naval personnel to safety.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for how much longer? Keyes wondered. The continuous scrambling through the rocks, the lack of sleep, and the constant danger not only left them exhausted but levied a toll on morale as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbiad, Lovell, and Hikowa were still in fairly good shape, as were Wang and Singh, but Ensign Dowski had started to crack. It had started with a little self-concerned whining, grown into a stream of nonstop complaints, and now threatened to escalate into something worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe humans were gathered in a dry grotto. Jagged rocks projected over their heads to provide some protection from the Banshee above. Wang knelt next to the thin, dirt-choked stream that gushed through the rocky passageway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe splashed water on his face. Singh was busy filling the command party’s canteens while Dowski sat on a rock and glowered. “They know where we are,” the junior officer said accusingly, as if her commanding officer were somehow at fault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes sighed. “ ‘They know where we are, sir .’ ”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” the Ensign replied, “They know where we are, sir . So why continue to run? They’ll catch us in the end.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe,” Keyes agreed as he dabbed ointment onto a burst blister, “and maybe not. I’ve been in contact with both Cortana and Wellsley. They’re both busy at the moment, but they’ll send help as soon as they can. In the meantime, we tie up as many of their resources as possible, avoid capture, and kill some of the bastards if we can.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For what?” Dowski demanded. “So you can make Admiral? I submit that we’ve done all we could reasonably be expected to do, that the longer we delay the harsher the Covenant will be. It makes sense to surrender now .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you are an idiot ,” Lieutenant Hikowa put in, her eyes blazing with uncharacteristic anger. “First of all, the Captain rates the honorific ‘sir.’ You will render that honorific or I will plant my foot in your ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Secondly, use your brain, assuming that you have one. The Covenant doesn’t take prisoners, everyone knows that, so surrender equals death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, yeah?” Dowski said defiantly. “Well, why haven’t they already killed us then? They could strafe us with cannons, fire rockets into the rocks, or drop bombs on our position, but they haven’t. Explain that .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Explain this ,” Singh said, inserting the barrel of his M6D into the Ensign’s left ear. “I’m starting to think that you look a lot like a Grunt. Lovell . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003echeck her face. I’ll bet it peels right off.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKeyes closed the fastener on the light-duty deck shoes, wished he had a pair of combat boots like the Marines wore, and knew Dowski was partially correct, insubordination aside. It did seem as though the aliens were intent on capturing his party rather than killing them, but why? It didn’t square with their behavior in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, the Covenant had changed tactics on him before—when he’d beaten the tar out of them at Sigma Octanus, and again when they’d returned the favor at Reach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe officer watched the tableau as it unfolded in front of him. Hikowa stood with her fists on her hips, face contorted with anger, while Singh screwed his weapon into Dowski’s ear. The rest of the bridge crew were frozen, uncertain. The Marines weren’t present, thank God, but it would be na?ve to think they weren’t aware of the Ensign’s opinions, or of the discord among their superiors. The enlisted ranks always knew, one way or another. So, what to do? Dowski wasn’t about to change her mind, that was obvious, and she was becoming a liability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Banshee whined loudly as it passed over the grotto for the second time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey needed to move and do it soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Okay,” Keyes said, “you win. I should charge you with cowardice, insubordination, and dereliction of duty, but I’m a little pressed for time. So I hereby give you permission to surrender. Hikowa, relieve her of her weapon, ammo, and pack. Singh, truss her up. Nothing too tight . . . just enough so she can’t follow us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA look of horror came over Dowski’s face. “You’re going to leave me? All by myself? With no supplies?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” Keyes answered calmly, “you wanted to surrender, remember? The Covenant will keep you company, and as for supplies, well, I have no idea what sort of rations they eat, but it should be interesting if they allow you a last meal. Bon appétit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDowski started to babble incoherently but Singh grew tired of it, shoved a battle dressing into the Ensign’s mouth, and used some all-purpose repair tape to hold it in place. He used some of the same tape to hog-tie the officer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That should keep her out of trouble for a while.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRocks clattered as Corporal Wilkins and two of his fellow Marines made their way down the streambed. The noncom saw Dowski, nodded as if everything were perfectly normal, and looked to Keyes. “A Covenant dropship landed a squad of Elites about one klick to the south, sir. It’s time to move.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Naval officer nodded. “Thank you, Corporal. The command team is ready. Please lead the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, a few hundred meters above, and half a klick to the north, the Elite named Ado ’Mortumee put his Banshee into a wide turn, and watched the dropship touch down. There weren’t many places to land, which meant that once on the ground his fellow Elites would still have a ways to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than drop hundreds of troops onto the rocky hillsides, and leave them to scramble over the exhausting up-and-down terrain, the Covenant command structure decided to use its air superiority to locate the humans and capture them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there, ’Mortumee mused, is the problem. Locating the aliens is one thing—capturing them is another. During the time since they had landed, the humans had proven themselves to be quite resourceful. Not only had they evaded capture, they had killed six of their pursuers, who, acting under strict orders to take the aliens alive, were at a considerable disadvantage. It made more sense simply to kill the humans. Of course, he was a mere pilot and soldier, not privy to the machinations of the Prophets or the Ship Masters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the human lifeboat had been located, it wasn’t long before Covenant scouts found Isna ’Nosolee’s body, and ran a check on his identity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntelligence was notified, official wheels began to turn, and the Covenant commanders were confronted with a problem: Why would an Ossoona risk his life to board a human lifeboat and ride it to the surface? The answer seemed obvious: Because someone important was on that boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of which served to explain why none of the humans had been killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no way to know which alien ’Nosolee had been after—so all of them had to be preserved. ’Mortumee glanced down at the instruments arrayed in front of him. A change! A string of seven heat blobs was winding its way to arbitrary “north,” while one remained behind. What did that signify?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t long before ’Mortumee’s Banshee circled above the grotto. Dowski wrestled to free herself from the tape, and the Covenant closed in around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmoke swirled around the top of the butte as a Pelican pilot made use of his 70mm chin gun to silence a Covenant gun emplacement. Satisfied that the Covenant plasma turret—a powerful weapon that could be easily deployed and recovered—was silent, he dropped down to within four feet of the top of the butte.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifteen ODST Helljumpers—three more than the Pelican’s operational maximum—leaped from the Pelican’s troop bay and fanned out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCramming extra troops into a Pelican was a risky move, but Silva wanted to put as many soldiers as possible on the mesa, and Lieutenant “Cookie”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeterson knew his ship. The Pelican was still in reasonably good shape, he had the best maintenance crew in the Navy—what more could a pilot ask for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeterson felt the dropship drift upward as the Marines bailed out, and he fought to keep the ship steady and level. He spotted movement in the landing zone. The chin gun—linked to his helmet sensors—followed the movement of Peterson’s head. He spotted a column of Covenant troopers and fired. The heavy rotary cannon uttered a throaty roar and pounded the enemy formation into a puddle of blue-green paste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the last of the Helljumpers jumped off, the Crew Chief yelled “Clear!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eover the intercom. Peterson fired the ship’s belly jets, demanded additional power from the twin turbine engines, and left the butte behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is Echo 136,” the pilot said into his mike. “We are green, clean, and extremely mean. Over.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Roger that,” Wellsley replied emotionlessly. “Please return to way point two-five for another load of troopers. And, if you’re going to insist on poetry, try some Kipling. You might find some of it rather instructive. Over and out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeterson grinned, directed a one-fingered salute in the general direction of battalion HQ, and banked the dropship into a wide turn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eResistance had slackened within minutes of the first landing, which allowed Lieutenant Melissa McKay and the surviving members of her company to advance upward. A significant number of the path’s defenders were pulled away in a last-ditch attempt to hold their position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKay discovered that the path was blocked by an ancient rockfall about thirty meters up, but saw the side door that was located just downhill of it, and knew what the aliens had been trying to defend. Here was the back door, the way she could enter the butte’s interior, and push upward from there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlasma fire stuttered out of the entryway, struck the cliff above her head, and blew rocky divots out of the smooth surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKay motioned for her troops to retreat back around the pillar’s broad curvature, and waved a hand in the air. “Hey, Top! I need a launcher!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe company sergeant was six troopers back so that a single well-placed grenade couldn’t kill both leaders at once. He signaled assent, bawled an order, and passed one of the M19s forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKay accepted the weapon from the private behind her, checked to ensure that it packed a full load of rockets, and inched around the curve. Plasma fire sizzled out of the door, but the officer forced herself to remain perfectly still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe triggered the weapon’s 2X scope, sighted carefully, and squeezed the trigger. The tube jumped as the 102mm rocket raced away, sailed through the hole, and detonated with a loud roar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere must have been some ammo stored inside, because there was a blue- white secondary explosion which shook the rock beneath the ODST officer’s boots. A gout of fire flared from the side of the cliff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was difficult to imagine anyone or anything having survived such a blast, so McKay passed the launcher to the rear, and waved her troops forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a cheer as the Marines ran up the path, shouldered their way through the smoke, and entered the butte’s ancient interior. There were bodies, or what had been bodies. Fortunately, the tunnel was intact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of troopers collected plasma weapons, tried them out on the nearest wall, and added them to their personal armament.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOthers, McKay included, stared up through a thirty-meter-wide well toward the circle of daylight above. She saw a shadow pass overhead as one of the Pelicans dropped even more Helljumpers onto the mesa. The distant thump!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof a frag grenade detonation made dust and loose soil tumble down on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, Loot,” Private Satha said, “what’s the deal with this ?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSatha stomped on the floor and it rang in response. That was when McKay realized that she and her troops were standing on a large metal grating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s it for?” the private wondered aloud. “To keep us out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKay shook her head. “No, it looks old , too old to have been put in place by the Covenant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I found a lift!” one of the Marines yelled. “That’s what it looks like, anyway—come check it out!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcKay went to investigate. Was this a way to reach the mesa? Her boot dislodged a shell casing which fell through one of the grating’s rectangular holes and dropped into the darkness below. It was a long time before it could be heard clanging off ancient stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilva, Wellsley, and the rest of the Major’s headquarters organization were on top of the butte waiting for her by the time McKay rode the antigrav lift to the surface and stepped out into the harsh sunlight. She blinked as she looked around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBodies lay everywhere. Some wore Marine green but the vast majority were dressed in the rainbow colors that the Covenant used to identify its various ranks and specialties. A squad of Helljumpers moved through the carnage, searching for wounded humans, and kicking corpses to make sure that the enemy soldiers were actually dead. One of them attempted to rise and received a burst from an assault weapon for his trouble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Welcome to Alpha Base,” Major Silva said as he arrived at McKay’s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You and your company did a damn good job, Lieutenant. Wellsley will have the rest of the battalion up here within the hour. It looks like I owe you that beer.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, sir,” McKay replied happily. “You sure as hell do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tunnel was huge , plenty large enough to handle a Scorpion tank, which meant that the Master Chief had little difficulty steering the Warthog through the initial opening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d almost missed the entry, at the bottom of a large dry wash. Cortana’s sensors had identified the entrance to the tunnel system. “It’s not a natural formation,” she’d warned him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat meant someone built it. Logically, it meant that the tunnel led somewhere—and it might shave precious time off his search for the crashed lifeboats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce inside, things became a little more difficult as the Spartan was forced to maneuver the LRV up ramps, through a series of tight turns, and right to the very edge of a pit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA quick recon confirmed that the gap was narrow enough to jump, assuming the ’Hog had a running start. The Master Chief backed away, warned the gunner to hang on, and put his foot to the floor. The LRV raced up the ramp, sailed through air, and jounced to a hard landing on the other side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m picking up lots of Covenant traffic,” Cortana said. “It sounds like Major Silva and the Helljumpers have captured an enemy position. If we can round up the rest of the survivors, and find Captain Keyes, we’ll have a chance to coordinate some serious resistance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good,” the Master Chief answered. “It’s about time something broke our way.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Warthog’s headlights swung across ancient walls as the Spartan turned the wheel, and the LRV emerged into a large open area, dotted with mysterious installations. It was dark; the road ended in front of a deep chasm. It wasn’t long before Covenant troops emerged like maggots spilling out of a rotting corpse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlasma fire splashed across the Warthog’s windscreen. The Spartan dove from the vehicle, crouched near the driver’s-side front tire, and drew his pistol. Fitzgerald opened up with the LAAG and swept the area with fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpent shell casings rained all around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chief peered over the edge of the Warthog. They were dangerously exposed. The roadway they’d been using was devoid of cover, elevated roughly three meters above the rest of the massive vaulted chamber. Worse, it bisected the chamber, which left them exposed on virtually all sides.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe giant enclosure was dimly lit; visibility was poor and the muzzle flash from the Warthog’s gun played hell with his night vision. He blinked his eyes to clear them, then activated his pistol’s scope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe metal floor dropped away to either side, and every surface was engraved with the strange geometric patterns that festooned Halo’s mysterious architecture. Set well back from their position were a number of small structures, pillars, and support pylons. The Covenant were dug in among them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA Grunt popped out from cover, his plasma pistol glowing green—he’d overcharged the weapon. The little SOBs liked to dump energy into the weapon, and discharge it all at once. It drained the weapon damn quick, but it also inflicted hellish damage on a target. A pulsing green-white orb of plasma sizzled past the Warthog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief returned fire, then dropped back behind the ’Hog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fitzgerald,” he barked. “Keep fire on them. I’ll move up on the left and take them out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Got it.” The tribarreled gun thundered, and fire hosed the Covenant position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spartan was prepared to charge ahead and into the fight when his motion sensor painted movement from the rear. The LAAG ceased fire as Fitzgerald yelled in pain and fell from the back of the Warthog. The Marine’s helmet cracked into the metal floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA shard of glassy, translucent material, tapered to a wicked point, protruded from the Marine’s bicep. The shard glowed a ghostly purple. “God damn it!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFitzgerald grunted, as he tried to regain his footing. Two seconds later, the purple shard exploded, and blood sprayed from the wound. Fitzgerald howled in agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no time to tend to Fitzgerald’s injuries. A pair of Grunts charged up the slight incline and opened fire. A barrage of the glassy projectiles arced toward them and ricocheted madly from the Warthog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were too close. The Chief fired at the nearest Grunt, three shots in succession. A trio of bullet pocks formed a neat cluster in the alien’s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Grunt’s partner squealed in anger and brought his gun to bear—an odd, hunchbacked device with a ridge of the glassy projectiles protruding from it like dorsal fins. The weapon spat purple-white needles at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sidestepped and slammed the butt of the pistol into the Grunt’s head. The alien’s skull caved in. He kicked the corpse back down the incline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFitzgerald had crawled to cover behind the Warthog. He was pale, but didn’t look shocky yet. The Spartan grabbed a first aid kit and expertly treated the wound. Self-sealing bio-foam filled the wound, packed it off, and numbed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe young Marine would need some stitches and some time to rebuild the torn, savaged muscle of his arm, but he’d live—if either of them made it out of here alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You okay?” he asked the wounded soldier. Fitzgerald nodded, wiped sweat from his forehead with a bloody hand, then struggled back to his feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout another word, he manned the LAAG.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took the better part of fifteen minutes for the Master Chief and the gunner to sweep the area clear of Covenant forces. The Spartan patrolled the perimeter. To the left of the Warthog, the chamber stretched roughly eighty meters, then ended—as did the road ahead—in a massive chasm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Any ideas?” he asked Cortana.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a brief pause as the AI examined the data. “The roadway ahead ends in a gap, but it’s logical to assume that there’s some kind of bridge mechanism. Find the controls that extend the bridge and we should be able to get across.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded. He turned back and crossed the roadway and headed off to the right of the parked Warthog. As he passed the vehicle, he called over his shoulder to Fitzgerald. “Wait here. I’m going to find us a way across.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief marched across the chamber, and checked the odd structures that dotted the landscape. Some were illuminated by the dim glow from some kind of light panels, but there was no indication what powered them, or what the structures contained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowned. There didn’t seem to be any sign of mechanisms or controls. He was about to head back to the Warthog and backtrack their course, then stopped. He stared at one of the massive pillars that stretched to the ceiling far overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing down here, but perhaps the mechanism he sought was above them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved as far to the end of the area as he could. Unlike the opposite side of the chamber, this half was bordered by a high, grooved metal wall. He followed the edge of the barrier and was gratified to locate a gap in the wall—a doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside, a ramp led up twenty meters, then turned ninety degrees to the left. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-the-flood-halo-2/page-6.html","bookId":1634,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:00 PM"}
