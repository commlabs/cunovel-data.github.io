This mercenary leader that was supposed to die in the corridor now lived. This would interfere with the original plot considerably. Of course he may die to zombies or Hunters later, no one could predict it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne looked at everyone, then said, \"We will continue!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Continue?\" Spence shouted, \"Continue what? You kidding me? There\u0027s no way I\u0027m going down there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne turned to Kaplan. His face was full of sweat, \"Yes, yes. I turned off all her defenses. All...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne repeated, \"All? You positive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout waiting for Kaplan to respond, One picked up the device and walked through the corridor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaplan was still typing. This time the door didn\u0027t close. Alice followed like in the original plot. After they went through, the door to the Red Queen closed again. Zheng\u0027s group looked at each other. They knew they were going to face the theme of Resident Evil: zombies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan said to Zheng and Xiaoyi in a low voice, \"Don\u0027t get too far away from Jie. Don\u0027t get bit by zombies. In the movie, once you get infected you will become a zombie in thirty minutes. I did a rough calculation, the vaccine only works within ten minutes of getting bit. Remember to stay close to Jie. Since he lived through three movies, he will probably survive this one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey nodded. Then Lan suddenly smiled, \"Right and do you feel disgusted from the murders?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiaoyi replied first, \"I felt disgusted when I\u0027d just arrived here. And I wasn\u0027t accustomed to this place. But after vomiting before, I feel like I have loosened up. If I do it with my eyes closed, I think I can kill someone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng thought for a bit. He too felt much better after vomiting, especially since he experienced life and death. He got rid of the surreal sensation he had and slowly integrated into this movie. As long as he could survive, killing monsters, humans, he\u0027s willing to do anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan continued, \"Ok, then find a chance to pick up their guns. If you see a zombie got separated from the pack, then kill it. These are reward points! Remember, head, that\u0027s their weak point.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the room dimmed down. They knew One had turned off the central computer. At the same time, the defense system that isolated zombies and Hunters stopped working. After what happened to Zheng, they didn\u0027t dare to change the plot this time and just waited as the central computer was shut down. Then they will have to go face to face with death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the dark, Zheng could feel Xiaoyi shivering non-stop. Even Lan was shivering. He asked, \"Scared?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiaoyi answered, \"Yea, very scared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough Lan said, \"Too excited...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng suddenly felt Lan was terrifying. He didn\u0027t ask anymore questions and turned to the only light source. Silently waiting for what\u0027s going to happen next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a minute, the room lit up again. Zheng knew everything was starting!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne and Alice came back from the central computer room. One looked exhausted, he took a look at the corpses in the corridor, \"We will bring the Red Queen\u0027s main circuit back to the corporation first. Kaplan, how\u0027s the Hive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaplan turned to his computer, \"Good, all defenses are down. We can leave the Hive in a straight line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne nodded, \"Ok, then now...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he finished, gunshots came from Dining Hall B. One looked at Kaplan then they ran out of the room. Alice and the other cast followed. Then Zheng\u0027s group followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Zheng reached Dinning Hall B, he took notice of those cases containing Hunters. The lights on the cases had turned from green to red. Just thinking about how many of them were in this room sent goosebumps up his spine. This wasn\u0027t something a human could rival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne asked, \"What\u0027s wrong? I heard gunshots.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRain lost a piece between her thumb and index finger. It was bloody and horrifying. \"Sir, we found a survivor. But he\u0027s gone mad. He bit me...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne frowned, \"So you opened fire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRain shouted in reply, \"But Sir, he\u0027s gone mad!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s gone,\" Jie suddenly said. He looked at the pool of blood on the ground and said, \"He was here just then but he\u0027s now gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne walked over to the pool of blood. The blood was already half solidified. This definitely wasn\u0027t like fresh blood. He felt a bad premonition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne stood up and shouted, \"We\u0027re leaving immediately!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRain felt strange and asked, \"Sir? Aren\u0027t our orders to wait here for backup after we get the Red Queen\u0027s main circuit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne shook his head, \"There\u0027s no more backup. Prepare to leave!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan walked over to Jie and asked, \"You just reminded them, aren\u0027t you afraid of changing the plot?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJie laughed, \"You guys are the fearless ones. You changed the plot as a newbie and survived. Look at your watch, One\u0027s name is not there anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan and Zheng looked at the watch, it was blank on the place where One\u0027s name used to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJie sneered at them, \"We\u0027re free to move from now on. Remember you can do anything as long as it means surviving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe thought for a moment and added, \"If I was in your position–with the lack of stamina, reaction speed, and weapons–I would follow the group back to the Red Queen\u0027s room. At least you will be safe for a little longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan smiled, \"You\u0027re actually quite a nice person. You\u0027re just not good at expressing yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJie laughed, \"Nice? Don\u0027t joke around. I just didn\u0027t want you to hinder me earning points. Don\u0027t be mistaken, there are no good people in this world. As long as I can survive, I don\u0027t mind using you three as meat shields.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tone of his words sent a chill down their spines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, a metallic sound came from afar. Rain and JD moved over cautiously. After a few steps, a man wearing a white robe came out from the corner. A few people lumbered and stumbled behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJD pointed at them, \"Stop there! Otherwise I will open fire!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese \"people\" obviously wouldn\u0027t stop there. They were already infected with the T-virus. Soon after, numerous people lumbered out from all sides of the room. Some were in uniforms and some in robes. Some of them had started rotting, and there were some with totally deformed legs. Zheng even saw one with only half it\u0027s head left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop! I\u0027m going to shoot!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne was the first to shoot at these zombies. A zombie holding a hammer was knocked down. But he quickly got back up. After getting shot over ten times, it didn\u0027t even bleed much.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBang!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJie shot with his desert eagle. It blew up the zombie\u0027s head like a watermelon. \"You guys go find an exit. Leave this to me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne hesitated for a while and shouted, \"Okay, everyone remain in formation. JD, go find an exit. Rain, keep an eye on the prisoner. Everyone else, follow me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng looked back at Jie. He waited for the zombies to approach then shot at them all at once. The few zombies closest to him all got shot in the head. His accuracy and speed were way higher than a normal person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng felt he could follow Jie\u0027s movements. He had read some books on MMA. There were two types of visual acuity. Distant visual acuity measured how far you could see and dynamic visual acuity defined your eyes ability to discern fine detail in moving objects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed like dynamic visual acuity was related to reaction speed. He could see Jie\u0027s movements clearly which meant the difference between their reaction speeds wasn\u0027t that big. And he was disgusted at first by the blown up zombies, but he was feeling quite natural now. This was probably related to his mental capacity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027It seems like those rewards really enhanced my abilities!\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng was overjoyed. He stayed calm and followed One. Then One turned around and gave him a gun and two magazines. \"I can\u0027t take care of you guys. There\u0027s fifteen rounds of ammo in each magazine. Follow what Jie did and go for their heads.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng understood it more than anyone. Even though he never used a gun before, he was shooting very fast thanks to his enhanced reaction speed. He was smart enough to only aim for zombies within ten meters. Ten meters was his effective shooting distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other people didn\u0027t know about this and just saw him getting headshots without aiming. One nodded and left his back to Jie and Zheng.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiaoyi saw it and was full of excitement. \"Zheng that was amazing! You\u0027re probably used to shooting? How many points was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne turned around to him. \"Points?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiaoyi\u0027s face darkened. Zheng knew he\u0027d probably heard a warning that deducted his points. Poor dude was in the negatives before he earned one point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne looked at the three of them then turn back to the zombies. Lan patted her chest and muttered. \"That was dangerous. I thought the plot was going to change again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan actually had a nice body and her face was quite pretty. Zheng and Xiaoyi was staring at her when she patted her chest. She realized it and said, \"Is Jie going to be alright? We can\u0027t see him anymore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZheng knew she was trying to digress so he answered casually, \"He\u0027s probably all right. He\u0027s stronger than us and he has that desert eagle with unlimited ammo. Shit. If I survive this I will get one for myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan touched her forehead, this seemed to be a habit of hers. She had a larger forehead than the average person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One hundred points can enhance someone\u0027s power by a tenth. After I survive I have to ask Jie about the details on exchanges. But we don\u0027t have time to talk about this. You should just concentrate on protecting us.\" She smiled at Zheng.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-1-chapter-2-2\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-1-chapter-3-2\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity/ti-vol-1-chapter-3-1","bookId":1512,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 6:20:19 AM"}
