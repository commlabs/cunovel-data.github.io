There was no real justification for this bloodshed; the goal was personal wealth. As yet, however, Brohl Handar did not know what he was going to do about it, if Indeed he was going to do anything. He had prepared a long report to the Emperor, providing well-documented details describing the situation here in Drene. That report remained in Brohl’s possession, for he had begun to suspect that, should he send it off to Letheras, it would not reach the Emperor, or any of his Edur advisors. The Letherii Chancellor, Triban Gnol, appeared to be complicit and possibly even in league with Letur Anict-hinting at a vast web of power, hidden beneath the surface and seeminghly thriving unaffected by Edur rule. At the moment, all Brohl Handar had were suspicions, hints of that insidious web of power. One link was certain, and that was with this Letherii association of wealthy families, the Liberty Consign. Possibly, this organization was at the very heart of the hidden power. But he could not be sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrohl Handar, a minor noble among the Tiste Edur, and newly appointed Overseer to a small city in a remote corner of the empire, well knew that he could not challenge such a thing as the Liberty Consign. He was, indeed, beginning to believe that the Tiste Edur tribes, scattered as they had become across this vast land, were little more than flotsam riding the indifferent currents of a turgid, deep river.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, there is the Emperor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho is quite probably insane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe did not know to whom to turn; nor even if what he was witnessing was, in truth, as dangerous as it seemed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrohl was startled by a commotion near the gate and he leaned forward to set an eye against the slit between the shutters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn arrest. People were quickly moving away from the scene as two nondescript Letherii, one to each side, pushed their victim face-first against one of the gate’s uprights. There were no shouted accusations, no frightened denials. The silence shared by the Patriotist agents and their prisoner left the Overseer strangely shaken. As if the details did not matter to any of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the agents was searching for weapons, finding none, and then, as his fellow agent held the man against the ornate upright, he removed the leather hip-satchel from the man’s belt and began rummaging through it.’ The prisoner’s face was pressed sideways against the bas-relief carvings on the broad, squared column, and those carvings depicted some past glory of the Letherii Empire. Brohl iliiiiihu suspected the irony was lost on all concerned. Sedition would be the charge. It was always the charge. But against what? Not the presence of the Tiste Edur-that would be pointless, after all, and certainly there had been virtually no attempts at reprisal, at least none that Brohl Handar had heard about. So… what, precisely? Against whom? The Indebted always existed, and some fled their debts, but most did not. There were sects formulated around political or social disquiet, many of them drawing membership from the disenfranchised remnants of sub-jugated tribes-the Fent, the Nerek, Tarthenal and others. But since the conquest, most of these sects had either dissolved or fled the empire. Sedition. A charge to silence debate. Somewhere, therefore, there must exist a list of the accepted beliefs, the host of convictions and faiths that composed the proper doctrine. Or was something more insidious at work?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a scratch at the carriage door, and a moment later it opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrohl Handar studied the figure stepping onto the runner, the carriage tilting with his weight. ‘By all means, Orbyn,’ he said, ‘enter.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuscle softened by years of inactivity, fleshy face, the Jowls heavy and slack, Orbyn ‘Truthfinder’ seemed to sweat incessantly, regardless of ambient temperature, as if some internal pressure forced the toxins of his mind to the surface of his skin. The local head of the Patriotists was, to Brohl Handar’s eye, the most despicable, malicious creature he had ever met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Your arrival is well timed,’ the Tiste Edur said as Orbyn entered the carriage and settled down on the bench opposite, the acrid smell of his sweat wafting across. ‘Although I was not aware that you personally oversee the daily activities of your agents.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e()rbyn’s thin lips creased in a smile. ‘We have stumbled\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eON some information that might be of interest to you, Overseer.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Another one of your non-existent conspiracies?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smile widened momentarily, a flicker. ‘If you are referring to the Bolkando Conspiracy, alas, that one belongs to the Liberty Consign. The information we have acquired concerns your people.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy people. ‘Very well.’ Brohl Handar waited. Outside, the two agents were dragging their prisoner away, and around them the flow of humanity resumed, furtive in their avoidance. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-25.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
