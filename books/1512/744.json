Of course, this is assuming he’s still alive. The scheming and calculations between us five brains really does make the mind go crazy.” Honglu mumbled. He fiddled with his hair nonstop as he looked askance at Xuan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eThat fellow really was leisurely, as compared to Honglu’s state that was completely devoted to contemplation. There wasn’t any bloodshot eyes or signs of exhaustion. As always, he was leisurely eating an apple while continuously fiddling with some small devices. It wasn\u0027t even possible to infer his mental state from his expression or actions. Was this the advantage of having no feelings or senses? Or was it because he lacked so much, that the heavens made it up to him with that intelligence?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e(Is he a favoured of the heavens? Or is he a tragedy born in the name of destiny?) Honglu laughed self-mockingly, before focusing his attention on the current situation. This situation analysis had already taken up two days and two nights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eIt wasn’t that Honglu’s intelligence was bad. No matter from what angle, he had no qualms about Xuan being at the peak of intelligence. In intelligence, he definitely wouldn’t lose to Neos. It was because team China’s Chu Xuan had too much brilliance that his own radiance was outshone. That was why his intelligence didn’t seem exceptional. If he was in any other team, he could have an important role that only the team leader was equal to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eFrom a certain perspective, the majority of team China was the same. They were all outshone by Zheng’s might, making them seem very weak...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eMeanwhile, as Honglu considered the current situation incessantly, the current situation was simple. Team China had met three teams along the way and said the same thing, to pass on to team Celestial and team Devil about the clue and the direction team China was taking. As for whether all this would be disseminated, they didn’t know. Man proposes, god disposes. Many a time, luck was a part of strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eSuperficially, the situation wasn’t complicated. It was just team China disseminating information, obviously to lay a trap in that city. However, if you took into account the two Xuans, as well as Adam and Honglu, and a possibly still alive Neos, the situation was radically different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Based on our current information, team Devil has an enhancement, ability or item that defies common sense. Its exact details aren’t important. The crux is that it’s omniscient. No, rather, it should belong to the domain of augury. That’s the only thing that can explain clone Zheng appearing in The Perfect Storm. Since there’s such a great ability, there must be an equally great price. What is it? Energy? Life force? Or points or ranked rewards? Whatever the case, this augury can’t be perpetually used.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eHonglu muttered to himself. He used strength to pluck off a hair. “But if it’s Xuan with this omniscience, that really is a horrible situation to the utmost. Someone like him, no. Something like him can’t be termed as a human anymore, but as a god, a god in the form of a human...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Logically speaking, such a Xuan should be peerless. However, he still revealed information to our Xuan. He also proposed the plan for team Devil and team China to surround team Celestial. This doesn’t fit Xuan’s personality. If he was peerless, he would definitely scheme to kill everyone and obtain a complete victory. Why would he play so many tricks? Either that omniscience is limited, or there was some restriction stopping him… a deterrence from clone Zheng’s power? Or does that omniscience have limited uses?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Anyways, clone Xuan holds the situational advantage this time round. So, hidden plots are useless, and may instead be used against us. No, it’s a guarantee. With this situation, the response of the other two was… our team’s Xuan agreed to work together against team Celestial, but his reaction was likely one that took into account clone Xuan and Adam. Although Adam is in the weakest position situationally this time, neither knowing of team Devil’s omniscience nor team China and team Devil’s cooperation against him, this may become his advantage instead. He will likely become an important chess piece the other two teams use to weaken the other. The main issue is that this chess piece is very strong, and could use some methods to instead become a chess player.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Next is Neos and I. Our stance and the schemes we can do will add to the variables of this plan.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eHonglu looked on at Xuan with a complicated expression. This thinking only remained in his mind. He wouldn’t be stupid enough to discuss with Xuan the plans, as team Devil’s omniscience was a sharp sword always hanging over their heads. He could only assist Xuan’s scheme based on his own intelligence and understanding of Xuan. And all this thinking was built upon the basis that Xuan wanted to scheme against team Devil and team Celestial at the same time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“In other words, the most important factor for victory over team Celestial… is me?” Honglu went blank after letting a breath out. He only stopped thinking after a long while. He had already wasted two days. He couldn’t continue on. No matter if his guess was right, it had to be realised, such as exterminating team Celestial and dragging team Devil into this battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Team Devil. Team Celestial. They’re like two giant mountain-like existences. What are their powerhouses doing now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eThe other two teams were different in style from team China. Rather, team China was different in style from all other teams. Every team had their own unique style. The most common was where a powerhouse controlled the team, or a team like team Southern Flame where the leader who controlled the team was the strategist. Of course, powerhouses would never like to be fettered. In this final battle, all the team’s powerhouses, or those whose strength reached a certain stage, would naturally take their own actions. They wouldn’t suffer the restrictions of others…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eFor example, team Celestial’s Luo Yinglong had already entered this world for three days. He had been very silent these three days, not even speaking a word. Even that blonde girlfriend of him continuously teasing him was the same. Towards these actions, the people in the team didn’t have much of a reaction. After all, he had already been like this since a few movies ago. Disregarding the old-timers, the newer ones weren’t familiar with him. Thus, they wouldn’t say anything even more so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eInstead, two of the white men were very interested in his blonde girlfriend. They would provoke Luo Yinglong from time to time. Of course, they didn’t dare go too far. Song Tian and Luo Yinglong were both Chinese. Who knew if this exceedingly strong person wielding a sword would come forward on behalf of Luo Yinglong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003eThis was because… they didn’t know Luo Yinglong’s true power.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Is that so?

Adam entered a state of contemplation, only saying this apparently normal but actually off reply after a long while.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"padding: 0px; outline: 0px; border: 0px rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-transform: none; text-indent: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; word-spacing: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: normal; orphans: 2; background-color: transparent\"\u003e“Of course. I remember it clearly. Team China leader Zheng Zha said it this way, not a single word differently… He really was strong. Standing before him was like facing the lofty mountains and vast seas.
