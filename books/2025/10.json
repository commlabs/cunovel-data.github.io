It wouldn\u0027t be long until Edward showed up, officially returning from his \"hiking\" trip. All of the pretenses were starting to wear on me. I wouldn\u0027t miss this part of being human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie peeked through the front window when he heard me slam the car door. He waved to Alice, and then went to get the door for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you have fun?\" Charlie asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, it was great. Very . . . girlie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI carried my stuff in, dumped it all at the foot of the stairs, and wandered into the kitchen to look for a snack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got a message,\" Charlie called after me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the kitchen counter, the phone message pad was propped up conspicuously against a saucepan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob called, Charlie had written.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe said he didn\u0027t mean it, and that he\u0027s sorry. He wants you to call him. Be nice and give him a break. He sounded upset.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grimaced. Charlie didn\u0027t usually editorialize on my messages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob could just go ahead and be upset. I didn\u0027t want to talk to him. Last I\u0027d heard, they weren\u0027t big on allowing phone calls from the other side. If Jacob preferred me dead, then maybe he should get used to the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy appetite evaporated. I turned an about face and went to put my things away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you going to call Jacob?\" Charlie asked. He was leaning around the living room wall, watching me pick up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not very attractive behavior, Bella,\" he said. \"Forgiveness is divine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mind your own business,\" I muttered under my breath, much too low for him to hear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew the laundry was building up, so after I put my toothpaste away and threw my dirty clothes in the hamper, I went to strip Charlie\u0027s bed. I left his sheets in a pile at the top of the stairs and went to get mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI paused beside the bed, cocking my head to the side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was my pillow? I turned in a circle, scanning the room. No pillow. I noticed that my room looked oddly tidy. Hadn\u0027t my gray sweatshirt been draped over the low bedpost on the footboard? And I would swear there had been a pair of dirty socks behind the rocking chair, along with the red blouse I\u0027d tried on two mornings ago, but decided was too dressy for school, hanging over the arm. . . . I spun around again. My hamper wasn\u0027t empty, but it wasn\u0027t overflowing, the way I thought it had been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas Charlie doing laundry? That was out of character.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad, did you start the wash?\" I shouted out my door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um, no,\" he shouted back, sounding guilty. \"Did you want me to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I got it. Were you looking for something in my room?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t find . . . a shirt. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t been in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then I remembered that Alice had been here to get my pajamas. I hadn\u0027t noticed that she\u0027d borrowed my pillow, too - probably since I\u0027d avoided the bed. It looked like she had cleaned while she was passing through. I blushed for my slovenly ways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that red shirt really wasn\u0027t dirty, so I went to save it from the hamper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI expected to find it near the top, but it wasn\u0027t there. I dug through the whole pile and still couldn\u0027t find it. I knew I was probably getting paranoid, but it seemed like something else was missing, or maybe more than one something. I didn\u0027t even have half a load here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ripped my sheets off and headed for the laundry closet, grabbing Charlie\u0027s on the way. The washing machine was empty. I checked the dryer, too, half-expecting to find a washed load waiting for me, courtesy of Alice. Nothing. I frowned, mystified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you find what you were looking for?\" Charlie yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went back upstairs to search under my bed. Nothing but dust bunnies. I started to dig through my dresser. Maybe I\u0027d put the red shirt away and forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave up when the doorbell rang. That would be Edward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Door,\" Charlie informed me from the couch as I skipped past him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t strain yourself, Dad.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled the door open with a big smile on my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward\u0027s golden eyes were wide, his nostrils flared, his lips pulled back over his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward?\" My voice was sharp with shock as I read his expression. \"What -?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his finger to my lips. \"Give me two seconds,\" he whispered. \"Don\u0027t move.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood frozen on the doorstep and he . . . disappeared. He moved so quickly that Charlie wouldn\u0027t even have seen him pass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I could compose myself enough to count to two, he was back. He put his arm around my waist and pulled me swiftly toward the kitchen. His eyes darted around the room, and he held me against his body as if he were shielding me from something. I threw a glance toward Charlie on the couch, but he was studiously ignoring us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone\u0027s been here,\" he murmured in my ear after he pulled me to the back of the kitchen. His voice was strained; it was difficult to hear him over the thumping of the washing machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I swear that no werewolves -\" I started to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not one of them,\" he interrupted me quickly, shaking his head. \"One of us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tone made it clear that he didn\u0027t mean a member of his family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt the blood empty from my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victoria?\" I choked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not a scent I recognize.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One of the Volturi,\" I guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Probably.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s why I think it must have been them - it wasn\u0027t long ago, early this morning while Charlie was sleeping. And whoever it was didn\u0027t touch him, so there must have been another purpose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looking for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t answer. His body was frozen, a statue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you two hissing about in here?\" Charlie asked suspiciously, rounding the corner with an empty popcorn bowl in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI felt green. A vampire had been in the house looking for me while Charlie slept. Panic overwhelmed me, closed my throat. I couldn\u0027t answer, I just stared at him in horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie\u0027s expression changed. Abruptly, he was grinning. \"If you two are having a fight . . . well, don\u0027t let me interrupt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill grinning, he put his bowl in the sink and sauntered out of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go,\" Edward said in a low hard voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Charlie!\" The fear was squeezing my chest, making it hard to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe deliberated for a short second, and then his phone was in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emmett,\" he muttered into the receiver. He began talking so fast that I couldn\u0027t understand the words. It was over in half a minute. He started pulling me toward the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Emmett and Jasper are on their way,\" he whispered when he felt my resistance. \"They\u0027ll sweep the woods. Charlie is fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let him drag me along then, too panicked to think clearly. Charlie met my frightened eyes with a smug grin, which suddenly turned to confusion. Edward had me out the door before Charlie could say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are we going?\" I couldn\u0027t stop whispering, even after we were in the car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to talk to Alice,\" he told me, his volume normal but his voice bleak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think maybe she saw something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at the road through narrowed eyes. \"Maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were waiting for us, on alert after Edward\u0027s call. It was like walking into a museum, everyone still as statues in various poses of stress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" Edward demanded as soon as we were through the door. I was shocked to see that he was glowering at Alice, his hands fisted in anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice stood with her arms folded tight across her chest. Only her lips moved. \"I have no idea. I didn\u0027t see anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is that possible?\" he hissed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Edward,\" I said, a quiet reproof. I didn\u0027t like him talking to Alice this way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlisle interrupted in a calming voice. \"It\u0027s not an exact science, Edward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was in her room, Alice. He could have still been there - waiting for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would have seen that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward threw his hands up in exasperation. \"Really? You\u0027re sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice\u0027s voice was cold when she answered. \"You\u0027ve already got me watching the Volturis\u0027 decisions, watching for Victoria\u0027s return, watching Bella\u0027s every step. You want to add another? Do I just have to watch Charlie, or Bella\u0027s room, or the house, or the whole street, too? Edward, if I try to do too much, things are going to start slipping through the cracks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It looks like they already are,\" Edward snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was never in any danger. There was nothing to see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re watching Italy, why didn\u0027t you see them send -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s them,\" Alice insisted. \"I would have seen that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who else would leave Charlie alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know,\" Alice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Helpful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it, Edward,\" I whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned on me, his face still livid, his teeth clenched together. He glared at me for half a second, and then, suddenly, he exhaled. His eyes widened and his jaw relaxed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right, Bella. I\u0027m sorry.\" He looked at Alice. \"Forgive me, Alice. I shouldn\u0027t be taking this out on you. That was inexcusable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand,\" Alice assured him. \"I\u0027m not happy about it, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward took a deep breath. \"Okay, let\u0027s look at this logically. What are the possibilities?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone seemed to thaw out at once. Alice relaxed and leaned against the back of the couch. Carlisle walked slowly toward her, his eyes far away. Esme sat on the sofa in front of Alice, curling her legs up on the seat. Only Rosalie remained unmoving, her back to us, staring out the glass wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward pulled me to the sofa and I sat next to Esme, who shifted to put her arm around me. He held one of my hands tightly in both of his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victoria?\" Carlisle asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward shook his head. \"No. I didn\u0027t know the scent. He might have been from the Volturi, someone I\u0027ve never met. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice shook her head. \"Aro hasn\u0027t asked anyone to look for her yet. I will see that. I\u0027m waiting for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward\u0027s head snapped up. \"You\u0027re watching for an official command.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think someone\u0027s acting on their own? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caius\u0027s idea,\" Edward suggested, his face tightening again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or Jane\u0027s . . . ,\" Alice said. \"They both have the resources to send an unfamiliar face. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward scowled. \"And the motivation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t make sense, though,\" Esme said. \"If whoever it was meant to wait for Bella, Alice would have seen that. He - or she - had no intention of hurting Bella. Or Charlie, for that matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cringed at my father\u0027s name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s going to be fine, Bella,\" Esme murmured, smoothing my hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what was the point then?\" Carlisle mused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Checking to see if I\u0027m still human?\" I guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Possible,\" Carlisle said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRosalie breathed out a sigh, loud enough for me to hear. She\u0027d unfrozen, and her face was turned expectantly toward the kitchen. Edward, on the other hand, looked discouraged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmmett burst through the kitchen door, Jasper right behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Long gone, hours ago,\" Emmett announced, disappointed. \"The trail went East, then South, and disappeared on a side road. Had a car waiting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s bad luck,\" Edward muttered. \"If he\u0027d gone west . . . well, it would be nice for those dogs to make themselves useful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI winced, and Esme rubbed my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJasper looked at Carlisle. \"Neither of us recognized him. But here.\" He held out something green and crumpled. Carlisle took it from him and held it to his face. I saw, as it exchanged hands, that it was a broken fern frond. \"Maybe you know the scent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Carlisle said. \"Not familiar. No one I\u0027ve ever met.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps we\u0027re looking at this the wrong way. Maybe it\u0027s a coincidence . . . ,\" Esme began, but stopped when she saw everyone else\u0027s incredulous expressions. \"I don\u0027t mean a coincidence that a stranger happened to pick Bella\u0027s house to visit at random. I meant that maybe someone was just curious. Our scent is all around her. Was he wondering what draws us there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why wouldn\u0027t he just come here then? If he was curious?\" Emmett demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You would,\" Esme said with a sudden, fond smile. \"The rest of us aren\u0027t always so direct. Our family is very large - he or she might be frightened. But Charlie wasn\u0027t harmed. This doesn\u0027t have to be an enemy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust curious. Like James and Victoria had been curious, in the beginning? The thought of Victoria made me tremble, though the one thing they seemed certain of was that it had not been her. Not this time. She would stick to her obsessed pattern. This was just someone else, a stranger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was slowly realizing that vampires were much bigger participants in this world than I\u0027d once thought. How many times did the average human cross paths with them, completely unaware? How many deaths, obliviously reported as crimes and accidents, were really due to their thirst? How crowded would this new world be when I finally joined it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shrouded future sent a shiver down my spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Cullens pondered Esme\u0027s words with varying expressions. I could see that Edward did not accept her theory, and that Carlisle very much wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlice pursed her lips. \"I don\u0027t think so. The timing of it was too perfect. . . . This visitor was so careful to make no contact. Almost like he or she knew that I would see. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He could have other reasons for not making contact,\" Esme reminded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it really matter who it was?\" I asked. \"Just the chance that someone was looking for me . . . isn\u0027t that reason enough? We shouldn\u0027t wait for graduation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Bella,\" Edward said quickly. \"It\u0027s not that bad. If you\u0027re really in danger, we\u0027ll know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think of Charlie,\" Carlisle reminded me. \"Think of how it would hurt him if you disappeared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am thinking of Charlie! He\u0027s the one I\u0027m worried about! What if my little guest had happened to be thirsty last night? As long as I\u0027m around Charlie, he\u0027s a target, too. If anything happened to him, it would be all myfault!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hardly, Bella,\" Esme said, patting my hair again. \"And nothing will happen to Charlie. We\u0027re just going to have to be more careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More careful?\" I repeated in disbelief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s all going to be fine, Bella,\" Alice promised; Edward squeezed my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I could see, looking at all of their beautiful faces one by one, that nothing I could say was going to change their minds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a quiet ride home. I was frustrated. Against my better judgment, I was still human.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t be alone for a second,\" Edward promised as he drove me to Charlie\u0027s. \"Someone will always be there. Emmett, Alice, Jasper . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"This is ridiculous. They\u0027ll get so bored, they\u0027ll have to kill me themselves, just for something to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward gave me a sour look. \"Hilarious, Bella.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie was in a good mood when we got back. He could see the tension between me and Edward, and he was misinterpreting it. He watched me throw together his dinner with a smug smile on his face. Edward had excused himself for a moment, to do some surveillance, I assumed, but Charlie waited till he was back to pass on my messages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jacob called again,\" Charlie said as soon as Edward was in the room. I kept my face empty as I set the plate in front of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that a fact?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie frowned. \"Don\u0027t be petty, Bella. He sounded really low.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Jacob paying you for all the P.R., or are you a volunteer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlie grumbled incoherently at me until the food cut off his garbled complaint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough he didn\u0027t realize it, he\u0027d found his mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy life was feeling a lot like a game of dice right now - would the next roll come up snake eyes? What if something did happen to me? It seemed worse than petty to leave Jacob feeling guilty about what he\u0027d said. But I didn\u0027t want to talk to him with Charlie around, to have to watch my every word so I didn\u0027t let the wrong thing slip. Thinking about this made me jealous of Jacob and Billy\u0027s relationship. How easy it must be when you had no secrets from the person you lived with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I would wait for the morning. I most likely wasn\u0027t going to die tonight, after all, and it wouldn\u0027t hurt him to feel guilty for twelve more hours. It might even be good for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Edward officially left for the evening, I wondered who was out in the downpour, keeping an eye on Charlie and me. I felt awful for Alice or whoever else it might be, but still comforted. I had to admit it was nice, knowing I wasn\u0027t alone. And Edward was back in record time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sang me to sleep again and - aware even in unconsciousness that he was there - I slept free of nightmares.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the morning, Charlie left to go fishing with Deputy Mark before I was up. I decided to use this lack of supervision to be divine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to let Jacob off the hook,\" I warned Edward after I\u0027d eaten breakfast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew you\u0027d forgive him,\" he said with an easy smile. \"Holding grudges is not one of your many talents.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes, but I was pleased. It seemed like Edward really was over the whole anti-werewolf thing. I didn\u0027t look at the clock until after I\u0027d dialed. It was a little early for calls, and I worried that I would wake Billy and Jake, but someone picked up before the second ring, so he couldn\u0027t have been too far from the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\" a dull voice said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jacob?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella!\" he exclaimed. \"Oh, Bella, I\u0027m so sorry!\" he tripped over the words as he hurried to get them out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I swear I didn\u0027t mean it. I was just being stupid. I was angry - but that\u0027s no excuse. It was the stupidest thing I\u0027ve ever said in my life and I\u0027m sorry. Don\u0027t be mad at me, please? Please. Lifetime of servitude up for grabs - all you have to do is forgive me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not mad. You\u0027re forgiven.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" he breathed fervently. \"I can\u0027t believe I was such a jerk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry about that - I\u0027m used to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed, exuberant with relief. \"Come down to see me,\" he begged. \"I want to make it up to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI frowned. \"How?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anything you want. Cliff diving,\" he suggested, laughing again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, there\u0027s a brilliant idea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll keep you safe,\" he promised. \"No matter what you want to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at Edward. His face was very calm, but I was sure this was not the time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not thrilled with me, is he?\" Jacob\u0027s voice was ashamed, rather than bitter, for once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not the problem. There\u0027s . . . well, there\u0027s this other problem that\u0027s slightly more worrisome than a bratty teenage werewolf. . . .\" I tried to keep my tone joking, but I didn\u0027t fool him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong?\" he demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Um.\" I wasn\u0027t sure what I should tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward held his hand out for the phone. I looked at his face carefully. He seemed calm enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bella?\" Jacob asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward sighed, holding his hand closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you mind speaking to Edward?\" I asked apprehensively. \"He wants to talk to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a long pause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" Jacob finally agreed. \"This should be interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI handed the phone to Edward; I hoped he could read the warning in my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Jacob,\" Edward said, perfectly polite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a silence. I bit my lip, trying to guess how Jacob would answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone was here - not a scent I know,\" Edward explained. \"Has your pack come across anything new?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother pause, while Edward nodded to himself, unsurprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here\u0027s the crux, Jacob. I won\u0027t be letting Bella out of my sight till I get this taken care of. It\u0027s nothing personal -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob interrupted him then, and I could hear the buzz of his voice from the receiver. Whatever he was saying, he was more intense than before. I tried unsuccessfully to make out the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might be right -,\" Edward began, but Jacob was arguing again. Neither of them sounded angry, at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s an interesting suggestion. We\u0027re quite willing to renegotiate. If Sam is amenable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob\u0027s voice was quieter now. I started chewing on my thumbnail as I tried to read Edward\u0027s expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Edward replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Jacob said something that caused a surprised expression to flicker across Edward\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d planned to go alone, actually,\" Edward said, answering the unexpected question. \"And leave her with the others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJacob\u0027s voice rose in pitch, and it sounded to me like he was trying to be persuasive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll try to consider it objectively,\" Edward promised. \"As objectively as I\u0027m capable of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pause was shorter this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s not a half-bad idea. When? . . . No, that\u0027s fine. I\u0027d like a chance to follow the trail personally, anyway. Ten minutes . . . Certainly,\" Edward said. He held the phone out to me. \"Bella?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took it slowly, feeling confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was that all about?\" I asked Jacob, my voice peeved. I knew it was juvenile, but I felt excluded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A truce, I think. Hey, do me a favor,\" Jacob suggested. \"Try to convince your bloodsucker that the safest place for you to be - especially when he leaves - is on the reservation. We\u0027re well able to handle anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that what you were trying to sell him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It makes sense. Charlie\u0027s probably better off here, too. As much as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get Billy on it,\" I agreed. I hated that I was putting Charlie within the range of the crosshairs that always seemed to be centered on me. \"What else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just rearranging some boundaries, so we can catch anyone who gets too near Forks. I\u0027m not sure if Sam will go for it, but until he comes around, I\u0027ll keep an eye on things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean by \u0027keep an eye on things\u0027?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean that if you see a wolf running around your house, don\u0027t shoot at it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not. You really shouldn\u0027t do anything . . . risky, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe snorted. \"Don\u0027t be stupid. I can take care of myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I also tried to convince him to let you visit. He\u0027s prejudiced, so don\u0027t let him give you any crap about safety. He knows as well as I do that you\u0027d be safe here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll keep that in mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See you in a few,\" Jacob said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re coming up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I\u0027m going to get the scent of your visitor so we can track him if he comes back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake, I really don\u0027t like the idea of you tracking -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh please, Bella,\" he interrupted. Jacob laughed, and then hung up. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-twilight-saga-3-eclipse-twilight-3/page-10.html","bookId":2025,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:14:22 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:14:22 PM"}
