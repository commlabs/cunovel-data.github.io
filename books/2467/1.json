{"id":81858,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs. Simmons? It\u0027s Vicki Nelson calling; the private investigator from Toronto?\" She paused and considered how best to present the information. Oh, what the hell... \"We\u0027ve found your husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is he... alive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am, very much so. He\u0027s working as an insurance adjuster under the name Tom O\u0027Conner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don always works in insurance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am, that\u0027s how we found him. I\u0027ve just sent you a package, by courier, containing a copy of everything we\u0027ve discovered including a number of recent photographs, you should receive it before noon tomorrow. The moment you call me with a positive ID, I\u0027ll take the information to the police and they can pick him up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The police thought they found him once before, in Vancouver, but when they went to pick him up he was gone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, he\u0027ll be there this time.\" Vicki leaned back in her chair, shoved her free hand up under the bottom edge of her glasses and scrubbed at her eyes. In eight years with the Metropolitan Toronto Police and nearly two years out on her own, she\u0027d seen some real SOBs; Simmons/O\u0027Conner ranked right up there with the best of them. Anyone who faked his own death in order to ditch a wife and five kids deserved exactly what he got. \"My partner\u0027s going to talk to him tonight. I think your husband will decide to stay right where he is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bar was noisy and smoky, with tables too small to be useful and chairs too stylized to be comfortable. The beer was overpriced, the liquor over-iced, and the menu a tarted-up mix of at least three kinds of quasi-ethnic cooking plus the usual grease and carbohydrates. The staff were all young, attractive, and interchangeable. The clientele were a little older, not quite so attractive although they tried desperately hard to camouflage it, and just as faceless. It was, for the moment, the premier poser bar in the city and all the wannabes in Toronto shoehorned themselves through its doors on Friday night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry Fitzroy paused just past the threshold and scanned the crowd through narrowed eyes. The smell of so many bodies crammed together, the sound of so many heartbeats pounding in time to the music blasting out of half a dozen suspended speakers, the feel of so many lives in so little space pulled the Hunger up and threatened to turn it loose. Fastidiousness more than willpower held it in check. In over four and a half centuries, Henry had never seen so many people working so hard and so futilely at having a good time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the kind of place he wouldn\u0027t be caught dead in under normal circumstances, but tonight he was hunting and this was where his quarry had gone to ground. The crowd parted as he moved away from the door, and eddies of whispered speculation followed in his wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who does he think he is... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... I\u0027m telling you, he\u0027s somebody... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry Fitzroy, bastard son of Henry VIII, one time Duke of Richmond and Somerset, Lord President of the Council of the North, noted, with an inward sigh, that some things never changed. He sat down at the bar, the young man who had been on the stool having vacated it as Henry approached, and waved the bartender away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo his right, an attractive young woman raised one ebony brow in obvious invitation. Although his gaze dropped to the pulse that beat in the ivory column of her throat and almost involuntarily traced the vein until it disappeared beneath the soft drape of magenta silk clinging to shoulders and breasts, he regretfully, silently, declined. She acknowledged both his glance and his refusal, then turned to more receptive game. Henry hid a smile. He wasn\u0027t the only hunter abroad tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo his left, a wide back in a charcoal gray suit made up most of the view. The hair above the suit had been artfully styled to hide the thinning patches just as the suit itself had been cut to cover the areas that a fortieth birthday had thickened. Henry reached out and tapped lightly on one wool-clad shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wearer of the suit turned, saw no one he knew, and began to scowl. Then he fell into the depths of a pair of hazel eyes, much darker than hazel eyes should have been, much deeper than mortal eyes could be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to have a talk, Mr. O\u0027Conner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would have taken a much stronger man to look away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In fact, I think you\u0027d better come with me.\" A thin sheen of sweat greased the other man\u0027s forehead. \"This is just a little too public for what I plan to... \" Slightly elongated canines became visible for an instant between parted lips. \"... discuss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry stood at the window, one hand flat against the cool glass. Although he seemed to be looking down at the lights of the city, he was actually watching the reflection of the woman seated on the couch behind him. \"And what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Henry, stop being an undead pain in the ass. Did you convince Mr. O\u0027Conner/Simmons to stay put until the police arrive?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe loved to watch her; loved to watch emotions play across her face, loved to watch her move, loved to watch her in repose. Loved her. But as that was a topic not to be discussed, all he said was, \"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. I hope you scared the living shit out of him while you were at it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vicki.\" He turned, arms crossed on his chest, and frowned in what was only partially mock disapproval. \"I am not your personal bogeyman, to be pulled out of the closet every time you think someone needs to have the fear of God... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki snorted. \"Think highly of yourself, don\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... put into them,\" he continued, ignoring the interruption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have I ever treated you like my \u0027personal bogeyman\u0027?\" She raised a hand to cut off his immediate reply. \"Be honest. You have certain skills, just like I have certain skills, and when I think it\u0027s necessary, I use them. Besides,\" she pushed her glasses back into place on the bridge of her nose, \"you said you wanted to be more involved in my business. Help out with more cases now that you\u0027ve handed in Purple Passion\u0027s Pinnacle and aren\u0027t due to start another romantic masterpiece until next month.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Love Labors On.\" Henry saw no reason to be ashamed of writing historical romances; it paid well and he was good at it. He doubted, however, that Vicki had ever read one. She wasn\u0027t the type to enjoy, or even desire, escape through fiction. \"Tonight, it wasn\u0027t what I had in mind when I said I wanted to be more involved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Henry, it\u0027s been over a year.\" She sounded amused. \"You should know by now that most private investigating consists of days and days of boring, tedious research. Thrilling and exciting life-threatening situations are few and far between.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry raised one red-gold brow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki looked a little sheepish. \"Look, it\u0027s not my fault people keep trying to kill me. And you. And anyway, you know those were the exceptions that prove the rule.\" She straightened, tucking one sneakered foot up under her butt. \"Tonight, I needed to convince a sleazebag, who deserved to be terrified after what he put his wife and kids through, to stay put until the police arrive. Tonight, I needed you. Henry Fitzroy, vampire. No one else could\u0027ve done it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon reflection, he was willing to grant her that no one else could have done the job as well although a couple of burly mortals and fifty feet of rope would have had the same general effect. \"You really didn\u0027t like him, did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I didn\u0027t.\" Her lip curled. \"It\u0027s one thing to walk out of your responsibilities, but it takes a special kind of asshole to do it in such a way that everyone thinks he\u0027s dead. They mourned him, Henry. Cried for him. And the son of a bitch was off building a new life, fancy-free, while they were bringing flowers, every Saturday, to an empty grave. If he hadn\u0027t gotten into the background of that national news report, they\u0027d still be crying for him. He owes them. In my book, he owes them big.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, then, you\u0027ll be happy to know that I did, as you so inelegantly put it, scare the living shit out of him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" She loosened her grip on the throw pillow. \"Did you... uh... feed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would it matter if I had?\" Would she admit it if it mattered. \"Blood\u0027s blood, Vicki. And his fear was enough to raise the Hunger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. And I know you feed from others. It\u0027s just...\" She dragged one hand through her hair, standing it up in dark blonde spikes. \"It\u0027s just that... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I didn\u0027t feed from him.\" Her involuntary smile was all he could have asked, so he crossed the room to see it better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re probably hungry, then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" He took her hand and gently caressed the inner skin of her wrist with his thumb. Her pulse leapt under his touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to stand, but he pushed her back, bent his head, and ran his tongue down the faint blue line of a vein. \"Henry, if we don\u0027t go soon, I won\u0027t be able to... \" Her voice faded out as her brain became preoccupied with other things. With a mighty effort, she forced her throat to open and her mouth to work. \"We\u0027ll end up staying on the... couch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted his mouth long enough to murmur, \"So?\" and that was the last coherent word either of them spoke for some time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Four o\u0027clock in the morning,\" Vicki muttered, digging for the keys to her apartment. \"Another two hours and I\u0027ll have seen the clock around. Again. Why do I keep doing this to myself?\" Her wrist throbbed, as if in answer, and she sighed. \"Never mind. Stupid question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuscles tensed across her back as the door unexpectedly swung fully open. The security chain hung loose, unlocked, arcing back and forth, scraping softly, metal against wood. Holding her breath, she filtered out the ambient noises of the apartment, the sound of the refrigerator motor, a dripping tap, the distant hum of the hydro substation across the street, and noted a faint mechanical whir. It sounded like...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe almost had it when a sudden noise drove off all hope of identification. The horrible crunching, grinding, smashing, continued for about ten seconds, then muted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027II grind his bones to make my bread... \" It was the closest she could come to figuring out what could possibly be happening. And all things considered, I\u0027m not denying the possibility of a literal translation. After demons, werewolves, mummies, not to mention the omnipresent vampire in her life, a Jack-eating giant in her living room was less than impossible no matter how unlikely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged the huge, black leather purse off her shoulder and caught it just before it hit the floor. With the strap wrapped twice around her wrist it made a weapon even a giant would flinch at. Good thing I hung onto that brick...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sensible thing to do would involve closing the door, trotting to the phone booth on the corner, and calling the cops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am way too tired for this shit. Vicki stepped silently into the apartment. Four in the morning courage. Gotta love it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSliding each foot a centimeter above the floor and placing it back down with exaggerated care, she made her way along the short length of hall and around the corner into the living room, senses straining. Over the last few months she\u0027d started to believe that, while the retinitis pigmentosa had robbed her of any semblance of night sight, sound and smell were beginning to compensate. The proof would be in the pudding; although she knew the streetlight outside the bay window provided a certain amount of illumination in spite of the blinds and the apartment never actually got completely dark, as far as her vision was concerned, she might as well be wearing a padded blindfold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, not quite a blindfold. Even she couldn\u0027t miss the blob of light that had to be the television flickering silently against the far wall. She stopped, weapon ready, cocked her head, and got a whiff of a well known after-shave mixed with... cheese?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sudden release of tension almost knocked her over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell are you doing here at this hour, Celluci?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does it look like?\" the familiar voice asked mockingly in turn. \"I\u0027m watching an incredibly stupid movie with the sound off and eating very stale taco chips. How long have you had these things sitting around, anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki groped for the wall, then walked her fingers along it to the switch for the overhead light. Blinking away tears as her sensitive eyes reacted to the glare, she gently lowered her purse to the floor. Mr. Chin, downstairs in the first floor apartment, wouldn\u0027t appreciate being woken up by twenty pounds of assorted bric-a-brac slamming into his ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDetective-Sergeant Michael Celluci squinted up at her from the couch and set the half-empty bag of taco chips to one side. \"Rough night?\" he growled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYawning, she shrugged out of her jacket, tossing it over the back of the recliner. \"Not really. Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those bags under your eyes look more like a set of matched luggage.\" He swung his legs to the floor and stretched. \"Thirty-two just doesn\u0027t bounce back the way thirty-one used to. You need more sleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which I had every intention of getting,\" she crossed the room and jabbed a finger at the television control panel, \"until I came home to find you in my living room. And you haven\u0027t answered my question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What question?\" He smiled charmingly, but eight years on the force with him, the last four intimately involved... Now that\u0027s a tidy label for a complicated situation, she mused ...had made her pretty much immune to classical good looks used to effect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m too tired for this shit, Celluci. Cut to the chase.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, I came by to see what you remembered about Howard Balland.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"Small-time hood, always looking for the big score but would probably miss said big score if it bit him on the butt. I thought he left town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci spread his hands. \"He\u0027s back, in a manner of speaking. A couple of kids found his body earlier tonight behind a bookstore down on Queen Street West.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027ve come to me to see if I remember anything that\u0027ll help you nail his killer?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mike, I was in fraud for only three short months before I transferred to homicide and that was a good chunk of time ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you don\u0027t remember anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t say that... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah.\" The single syllable held a disproportionate weight of sarcasm. \"You\u0027re tired and you\u0027d rather screw around with your little undead friend than help get the bastard who slit the throat of a harmless old con man. I understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki blinked. \"What the fuck are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what I\u0027m talking about. You\u0027ve been off playing Vlad the Impaler with Henry Fucking Fitzroy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brows drew down into a deep vee, the expression making it necessary for her to jab her glasses back up onto the bridge of her nose. \"I don\u0027t believe this. You\u0027re jealous!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were chest to chest and would\u0027ve been nose to nose accept for the difference in their heights. Although Vicki was tall at five ten, Celluci was taller still at six four.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"JEALOUS!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the years Vicki had learned enough Italian to get the gist of what followed. The fight had barely begun to heat up when a soft voice slid through a pause in the screaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExpressions ludicrously frozen in mid-snarl, they turned to face the wizened concern of Mr. Chin. He clutched a burgundy brocade bathrobe closed with one frail hand and had the other raised as though to snare their attention. When he saw he had it, he smiled into the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" he told them. \"Now, shall we see if we can maintain this situation?\" At their puzzled frowns, he sighed. \"Let me make it a little simpler for you. It\u0027s 4:22 a.m. Shut up.\" He waited for a moment, nodded, and left the apartment, gently pulling the door closed behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki felt her ears grow hot. She jerked around as a cross between a sneeze and a small explosion sounded from Celluci\u0027s direction. \"What are you laughing at?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, arms waving as he searched for the words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never mind.\" She reached up and pushed the curl of dark brown hair back off his face, her own mouth twisting up in a rueful grin. \"I guess it was pretty funny at that. Although I\u0027m going to spend the rest of the day with this vaguely unfinished feeling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci nodded, the thick curl dropping back down into his eyes. \"Like not remembering if you\u0027ve eaten the last bite of doughnut.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or drunk the last swallow of coffee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey shared a smile and Vicki collapsed into the black leather recliner that dominated the small living room. \"Okay, what do you need to know about the late Mr. Balland?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki moved away from the warm cliff of Celluci\u0027s back and wondered why she couldn\u0027t sleep. Maybe she should have told him to go home, but it\u0027d seemed a little pointless making him drive all the way out to his house in Downsview when he was expected back downtown at headquarters in barely six hours. Or less. Maybe. She couldn\u0027t see the clock unless she sat up, turned on the light, and found her glasses, but it had to be nearly dawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the center of the city, eighteen short blocks away from her apartment in Chinatown, Henry Fitzroy lay in his sealed room and waited for the day; waited for the rising sun to switch off his life; trusted that the setting sun would switch it on again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki had spent the day with Henry once, held captive by the threat of sunlight outside the bedroom door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe absence of life had been so complete it had been a little like spending the day with a corpse. Only worse. Because he wasn\u0027t. It wasn\u0027t an experience she wanted to repeat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d run from him that night, the moment the darkness had granted her safe passage. To this day she wasn\u0027t sure if she\u0027d run from his nature or from the trust that had allowed him to be so helpless before her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t stayed away for long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of late nights, or occasionally no nights at all, Henry Fitzroy had become a necessary part of her life. Although the physical attraction still tied her stomach in knots and caught the breath in her throat even after a year of exposure, what bothered her, almost frightened her, was how much he had invaded the rest of her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHenry Fitzroy, vampire, bastard son of Henry VIII, was Mystery. If she spent a lifetime trying, she could never know all he was. And, God help her, she couldn\u0027t resist a mystery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Celluci, she rolled onto her side and layered herself around the curve of his body, Celluci was the yin to her yang. She frowned. Or possibly the other way around. He was a shared joke, shared interests, a shared past. He fit into her life like a puzzle piece, interlocking and completing the picture. And now she thought of it, that frightened her, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was complete without him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWasn\u0027t she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLord, oh Lord, oh Lord. When did my life start resembling country and western music?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCelluci stirred under the force of her sigh and half roused. \"Almost forgot,\" he murmured. \"Your mother called.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe late morning sun had nearly cleared Vicki\u0027s bay window when she sat down at the kitchen table and reached for the phone. Returning her mother\u0027s call while Celluci was dressing would make it easier to deal with the questions she knew she was going to have to answer. Questions that would no doubt start with, Why was Michael Celluci in your apartment when you weren\u0027t? and escalate from there to the perpetual favorite, When will you be coming to visit?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed, fortified herself with a mouthful of coffee, and wrapped her fingers around the receiver. Before she could lift it out of the cradle, the phone rang. She managed, just barely, to keep the coffee from going out her nose but it took a half a dozen rings to get the choking under control. \"Nelson Investigations.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ms. Nelson? It\u0027s Mrs. Simmons. I was beginning to think you weren\u0027t there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry.\" She hooked a dish towel off the refrigerator door and swiped at the mess. \"What can I do for you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The photographs came. Of my husband.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki checked her watch. Nearly noon in Toronto meant nearly eleven in Winnipeg. Hot damn. Truth in advertising; I\u0027ve found a courier who can tell time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is my husband, Ms. Nelson. It\u0027s him.\" She sounded close to tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I\u0027ll take the information to the police this afternoon. They\u0027ll pick him up and then they\u0027ll get in contact with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s the weekend.\" Her protest was more a whimper than a wail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The police work weekends, Mrs. Simmons. Don\u0027t worry.\" Vicki turned up the reassurance in her voice. \"And even if they can\u0027t actually bring him in until Monday, well, I personally guarantee he\u0027s not going anywhere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re sure?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to ask him why, Ms. Nelson; why he did such a horrible thing to us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pain in the other woman\u0027s voice tightened Vicki\u0027s fingers on the receiver until her knuckles went white. She only just managed to mask her anger with sympathy during the final few moments of the call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"God-damned, fucking, son of a BITCH!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer notepad hit the far wall of the apartment with enough force to shatter the spine and send loose paper fluttering to the floor like a flock of wounded birds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyone I know?\" Celluci asked. As he\u0027d come into the living room barely a meter from the impact point, he supposed he should be thankful she hadn\u0027t thrown the coffee mug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\" She surged up out of her chair, slamming it back so hard it fell and bounced twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something to do with your found missing person?\" It wasn\u0027t that difficult a guess; he knew the bare bones of the case and he\u0027d heard her use the name Simmons during the phone conversation. Also, he knew Vicki and, while she was anything but uncomplicated, her reactions tended to be direct and to the point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lousy bastard!\" Her glasses slid to the end of her nose and she jabbed them back up the slope. \"Doesn\u0027t give a shit about what he put his family through. You should have heard her, Mike. He\u0027s destroyed everything she ever believed in. At least when she thought he was dead, she had memories, but now he\u0027s fucked those, too. He\u0027s hurt her so badly she hasn\u0027t even hit anger yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027re getting angry for her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"Why not, indeed.\" Intimately familiar with Vicki\u0027s temper he thought he saw something more than just rage at a woman wronged. Lord knew she\u0027d seen enough of that during her years on the force and had never, all right, seldom, reacted with such intensity. \"Your mother, did she ever get angry when your father left?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki came to a dead stop and stared at him. \"What the hell does that have to do with anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your father walked out on your mother. And you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My father, at least, had the minimal decency not to hide what he was doing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And your mother had to support the two of you. Probably never had time to get angry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes narrowed as she glared across the apartment at him. \"What the fuck are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe recognized the danger signs but couldn\u0027t let the opportunity pass. Things had been working toward this for a long time and with her anger for Mrs. Simmons leaving her so emotionally open he knew he might never get a better chance. What the hell, if it comes to it, I\u0027m armed. \"I\u0027m talking, whether you like it or not, about you and me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re talking bullshit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m talking about how you\u0027re so afraid of commitment that you\u0027ll barely admit we\u0027re anything more than friends. I understand where it\u0027s coming from. I understand that because of the way your father left and because of what happened afterward with your mother that you think you need to put tight little parameters on a relationship... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snorted. \"Did the force just send you to another sensitivity seminar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tightened his grip on his own temper and ignored her. \"... but all that happened over twenty years ago and, Vicki, it has to stop.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer lip curled. \"Or else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or else nothing, God damn it. I\u0027m not making threats here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is about Henry, isn\u0027t it? You are jealous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo point in forcing her to face the truth if he didn\u0027t. \"You\u0027re god-damned right I\u0027m jealous of Henry! I don\u0027t want to share that much of you with anyone else. Especially not with someone who... who... \" Mike Celluci didn\u0027t have the words to explain how he felt about Henry Fitzroy and even if he had, it was none of Vicki\u0027s business. The edge of his hand chopped off the thought. \"We\u0027re not talking about Henry, we\u0027re talking about us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing wrong with us.\" She looked everywhere but at the man standing across the room. \"Why can\u0027t we just go on the way we have been?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because we\u0027re not going anywhere!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe jerked at each staccato word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vicki, I\u0027m tired of being nothing more than your buddy. You\u0027ve got to realize that I... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shut up!\" Her hands had curled into fists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, no.\" He shook his head. \"You\u0027re going to hear it this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is my apartment. I don\u0027t have to hear anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yes you do.\" He crossed to stand directly in front of her, balancing on the balls of his feet, his hands a careful distance away. As much as he wanted to grab her and shake her, he didn\u0027t want to deal with the return violence he knew would follow. A quick game of Who\u0027s more macho? would add nothing to the situation. \"This isn\u0027t going to be the last time I say this, Vicki, so you\u0027d better get used to it. I love you. I want a future with you. Why is it so hard for you to accept that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why can\u0027t you just accept me, us, the way I am. We are.\" The words were forced out through clenched teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shoved the lock of hair back off his forehead and unsuccessfully tried to calm his breathing. \"I\u0027ve spent five fucking years accepting you and us. It\u0027s time you met me halfway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get out of my apartment! NOW!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrembling with the need to hold himself in check, he pushed past her and grabbed his coat off the hook by the door. Jabbing his arms into the sleeves, he turned. His own anger made it impossible for him to read her expression. \"Just one more thing, Vicki. I am not your fucking father.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door closed behind him with enough force to shake the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA heartbeat later it opened again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And don\u0027t forget to call your mother!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coffee mug exploded into a thousand pieces against the wood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did I what?\" Vicki snapped. Giving Henry the gist of the fight had put her in nearly as bad a mood as the fight had. It didn\u0027t help that she knew she should\u0027ve kept her mouth shut but when Henry had asked what was bothering her, she couldn\u0027t seem to stop a repeat of the whole infuriating conversation from pouring out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you call your mother?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I didn\u0027t.\" She turned to face the window, jabbed at her glasses, and glared out at the darkness. \"I wasn\u0027t exactly in the mood to talk to my mother. I went down to Missing Persons and nailed Mr. Simmons/O\u0027Conner to the wall instead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did that make you feel better?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Although it might have if they\u0027d let me use real nails.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA facetious comment spoken with complete and utter sincerity. Even from across the room Henry could feel pulsing waves of anger radiating off of her. He wished now that he hadn\u0027t asked, that he\u0027d ignored her mood and never been subjected to Detective-Sergeant Michael Celluci\u0027s all-too-accurate analysis of Vicki\u0027s inability to commit. But now that he\u0027d heard it, he couldn\u0027t let it rest. Vicki would continue to think about what Celluci had said, had obviously been thinking of little else since Celluci had slammed out of her apartment, and, now that her nose had been rubbed in it, would in time see it for the truth. At which point she would have to choose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wouldn\u0027t lose her. If that meant taking the day as well as the night, his love gave him a right equal to Celluci\u0027s to assert a claim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou raised the stakes, mortal, he told the other man silently. Remember that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood and crossed the carpet to stand at her side, glorying for a moment in her heartbeat, savoring her heat, her scent, her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He was right,\" he said at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About what?\" The words were forced out through clenched teeth. No need to ask which he was meant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t, any of us, go on the way we have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" The final consonant carried the weight of a potential explosion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because, like Mike Celluci, I want to be the most important person in your life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe snorted. \"And what about what I want?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could see the muscles working beneath the velvet surface of her skin, tensing around her eyes and the corners of her mouth and so he chose his next words with care. \"I think that\u0027s what we\u0027re trying to discover.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what if I decide I want him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer tone held a bitter, mocking edge. Henry couldn\u0027t help but respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you give me up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe power in his voice pulled her around to face him. He heard her swallow hard as she met his gaze, heard her heartbeat quicken, saw her pupils dilate, tasted the change in her scent on the air. Then he released her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki jerked back, furious at Henry, furious at herself. \"Don\u0027t ever do that again!\" she panted, fighting to get enough air into her lungs. \"I give nobody power over my life. Not you. Not him. Nobody!\" Barely in control of her movements, she whirled and stomped across the living room. \"I am out of here.\" She snatched her coat and bag up off the end of the couch, \"And you can just play Prince of fucking Darkness with somebody else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t moved from the window. He knew he could call her back, so he had no need to make the attempt. \"Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going for a long walk in the sleaziest neighborhood I can find in the hope that some dickweed will try something stupid and I can break his fucking arms! Don\u0027t follow me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven a security door can be slammed if enough force is applied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Vicki? It\u0027s your mother. Didn\u0027t Mike Celluci give you my message? Well, never mind, dear, I\u0027m sure he has a lot on his mind. While I\u0027m thinking of it though, I did wonder why he was in your apartment while you were out. Have you two been getting more serious? Call me when you get a chance. There\u0027s something I have to tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki sighed and rubbed at her temples as the answering machine rewound. It was ten after twelve and she was just not up to a heart-to-heart with her mother, not after the day she\u0027d had. \"Have you two been getting more serious?\" Jesus H. Christ.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst Celluci.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Henry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe powers-that-be had really decided to mess up her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever happened to men who just want to get laid on a regular basis?\" she muttered, flicking off the light and making her way to the bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pitcher of draft she\u0027d downed in the gay bar on Church Street, the one place in the city safe from testosterone cases, churned uneasily in her stomach. All she wanted to do was go to sleep. Alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d call her mother in the morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night had been filled with dreams, or more specifically, dream, the same images occurring over and over. People kept coming into her apartment and she couldn\u0027t get them to leave. The new staircase to the third floor bisected her kitchen and a steady stream of real estate agents moved up it, dragging potential tenants. The back of her closet opened into Maple Leaf Gardens and the post-hockey crowds decided to leave through her bedroom. First she tried the voice of reason. Then she yelled. Then she physically picked up the intruders and threw them out the door. But the door never stayed closed and they wouldn\u0027t, any of them, leave her alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe woke up late with a splitting headache and an aching jaw, her mood not significantly better than when she\u0027d gone to sleep. An antacid and an aspirin might have helped, but as she\u0027d run out of both she settled for a mug of coffee so strong her tongue curled in protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And why did I know it would be raining,\" she growled, squinting out through the blinds at a gray and uninviting world. The sky looked low enough to touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki turned and scowled across the room at it. She didn\u0027t have to answer to know it was her mother. She could feel mother vibes from where she stood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not this morning, Mom. I\u0027m just not up to it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer head continued ringing long after the bell fell silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later, it rang again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour of conscious thought had done nothing to improve Vicki\u0027s mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said no, Mom!\" She slammed her fist down on the kitchen table. The phone rocked but continued to ring. \"I don\u0027t want to hear about your problems right now and I sure as shit don\u0027t want to tell you about mine!\" Her voice rose. \"My personal life has suddenly collapsed. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on. Everything is falling apart. I can stand on my own. I can work as part of a team. I\u0027ve proved that, haven\u0027t I? Why isn\u0027t that enough!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt became a contest in volume and duration and Vicki had no intention of letting the phone win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Odds are good Celluci\u0027s about to propose and this vampire I\u0027m sleeping with... Oh, didn\u0027t I tell you about Henry, Mom? ...well he wants me as his... his... I don\u0027t know what Henry wants. Can you deal with that, Mom? \u0027Cause I sure as shit can\u0027t!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could feel herself trembling on the edge of hysteria, but she wouldn\u0027t quit until the phone did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Celluci thinks I\u0027m angry about the way dear old Dad walked out on you. Henry thinks he\u0027s right. How about that, Mom? I\u0027m being fucking double-teamed. You never warned me about something like this, did you, Mom? And we never, ever discuss Daddy!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe last word echoed around a silent apartment and seemed to take a very long time to fade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a trembling finger, Vicki slid her glasses back up her nose. \"I\u0027ll talk to you tomorrow, Mom. I promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later, the phone rang again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki turned on the answering machine and went for a walk in the rain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she got back, late that evening, there were seven messages waiting. She wiped the tape without listening to any of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicki paused, one foot into the shower, sighed, and got back into her robe. Welcome to Monday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Coming, Mom.\" No point putting it off. She\u0027d have to face the music sooner or later and it might as well be sooner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday things didn\u0027t seem so bad. Yesterday was an embarrassing memory of self-indulgence. Tomorrow, well, she\u0027d deal with tomorrow when it arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe dropped into one of the kitchen chairs and scooped up the receiver. \"Hi, Mom. Sorry about yesterday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is this Victoria Nelson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer ears grew hot. It was an elderly woman\u0027s voice, strained and tight and most definitely not her mother. Let\u0027s make a great impression on a potential client there, Vicki. \"Uh, yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Mrs. Shaw. Mrs. Elsa Shaw. I work with your mother. We met last September... ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember.\" Vicki winced. Mom must really be pissed if she\u0027s getting coworkers to call. This is going to cost me at least a visit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid I have some bad news for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bad news?\" Oh, God, don\u0027t let her have caught the early train to Toronto. That\u0027s all I need right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your mother hasn\u0027t been feeling well lately, and, well, she came into work this morning, said how she\u0027d been trying to get in touch with you, made the coffee like she always does, came out of Dr. Burke\u0027s office and... and, well, died.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe world stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ms. Nelson?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\" Vicki heard herself ask the question, marveled at how calm her voice sounded, wondered why she felt so numb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Burke, the head of the Life Sciences Department, well, you know who Dr. Burke is, of course, said it was her heart. A massive coronary, she said. One minute there, the next... \" Mrs. Shaw blew her nose. \"It happened about twenty minutes ago. If there\u0027s anything I can do... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Thank you. Thank you for calling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Mrs. Shaw had further sympathy or information to offer, Vicki didn\u0027t hear it. She set the receiver gently back in its cradle and stared down at the silent phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother was dead. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-pact-vicki-nelson-4/page-1.html","bookId":2467,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:06 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:39:06 PM"}
