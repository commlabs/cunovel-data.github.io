Like she knew that every guy there was thinking the exact same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e16\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDriving to Garrett\u0027s apartment was like driving through a different world. The rainstorm had swept through and the temperature had dropped suddenly into the low seventies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe streets were shiny and wet and the air was clean. It was enough to put anybody in a good mood, except maybe the parrot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDickhead was calling me every name in the book, flapping around and telling me just how he felt about being imprisoned in the VW most of the evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Five more minutes,\" I told him. \"Then we get you a new home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Noisy bastard,\" he squawked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed Garrett\u0027s safari van down Twentysixth toward Lamar. It was about eleven o\u0027clock, and there were still plenty of people hanging out at Les Amis drinking wine by the Franklin stove, talking outside the Stop \u0027N\u0027 Go, smoking in the parking lot of Tula, everybody enjoying the cooler air. Once in a while somebody would recognize the Carmen Miranda and wave. Garrett would honk back to the tune of \"Coconut Telegraph.\" The mound of plastic fruit hotglued to the roof shuddered every time he changed gears. My brother, the local celebrity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett\u0027s apartment building on Twentyfourth has all the charm of a Motel 6. The redwood box stands five units wide and three high, all the front doors facing south and painted lichen green. You get to Garrett\u0027s door by climbing up three flights of metal stairs and across a concrete walkway. No elevator. Garrett, of course, had chosen to live on the top floor so he could sue for access. Last I heard the case was going well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe landlord loved him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett pulled the Carmen Miranda in between a Harley and a broken washing machine. I parked by the frat house across the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is what I get,\" Garrett complained as he eased himself out of the van and into his wheelchair. \"Home before midnight. Thanks for the wonderful evening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he saw the parrot and his face brightened considerably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy shit,\" said Garrett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dickhead,\" said the bird, and flew off my shoulder onto Garrett\u0027s armrest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was love at first sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where the hell did you get him?\" Garrett was stroking the bird\u0027s beak. The bird was eyeing Garrett\u0027s beard like it might make a fine nest. I told Garrett that Dickhead was orphaned. I didn\u0027t tell him the last owner had died violently. Since Jimmy Buffett fans styled themselves \"parrot heads\" I figured the match was made in heaven. Or Key West, anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You approve?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bird was cawing some sweet obscenities in Garrett\u0027s ear. Garrett grinned and invited me up for a beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTres Navarre, etiquette master. You bust a few heads, you\u0027d better come prepared with a thoughtful \"I\u0027m sorry\" gift.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe got upstairs, Garrett taking them on his hands, pulling the chair after him. When he opened his front door the smell of patchouli nearly knocked me over. Even the parrot shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get yourself a Shiner,\" Garrett said. \"I\u0027ve got to play a couple of tunes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett\u0027s apartment is a long hallway—living room in front separated from the kitchen by a bar, one tiny bedroom in back. The only thing that keeps the place from feeling claustrophobic is the ceiling, which vaults up from the kitchen toward the front of the building at a fortyfivedegree angle. Skylights at the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI headed toward the refrigerator and Garrett wheeled himself over to the wall of electronic equipment that doubled as his computer and entertainment system. He turned on the main power switch and the lights of North Austin dimmed. He picked a CD to play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I could still hear myself talk I said, \"Who\u0027s winning?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou could hear the stereo from the downstairs neighbours just fine. They were playing Metallica. Playing isn\u0027t really the right verb for Metallica, I guess. Grinding, maybe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExtruding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett sighed. \"The bastards got new woofers last week. That was pretty bad. Then I got this friend of mine in here—used to do the Sensurround systems for Dolby. You know—the shaking effects they had with those seventies earthquake movies? He cut me a good deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great,\" I said. \"Earthquakes. After ten years in California, I get to come to Austin for earthquakes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked around the kitchen for something to strap myself to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Garrett turned up the volume the bookshelves on the wall started to shake, spilling copies of The Electric KoolAid Acid Test and The Anarchist\u0027s Cookbook. The Armadillo World Headquarters posters on the wall vibrated. The parrot started performing acrobatics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the moments when there were pauses and my brain fluids started flowing correctly again, I recognized the song as \"Bodhisattva\" by Steely Dan. We weren\u0027t so much listening to it as experiencing it by Braille.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI somehow managed to open a beer and drink it while the building shook. When the song was over it was quiet except for the parrot, who was still trying to punch his way out through the Plexiglas skylight. The downstairs neighbours’ stereo had stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett grinned like a madman. \"Gotcha.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does anybody—\" I stopped to readjust the volume of my voice. \"Does anybody ever call the cops?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who—Fred?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred the cop. Firstname basis. \"I guess that answers my question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett waved his hand dismissively. \"You call Fred, that\u0027s cheating. Sometimes somebody new moves into a side apartment, they try that for a while. It never lasts long. Now where\u0027s that hard drive you want squeezed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave him the card I\u0027d pulled from Julie Kearnes\u0027 computer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett wheeled himself over to his computer. He pecked at the keyboard. The screen glowed orange, then came alive with a short mandolin riff. Garrett whistled Steely Dan and started mixing and matching SCSI cables from his spare parts drawer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat down next to him in a battered black recliner that had been our father\u0027s. After twelve years, the leather still smelled faintly of his Cuban cigars and spilt bourbon. The left armrest was gouged out where I\u0027d used a penknife to dig a foxhole for my plastic army soldiers when I was seven. It was a comfortable place to sit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn,\" said Garrett.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett started to say something, then looked at me, probably realizing the effort it would take to filter what he was thinking from computerese to plain English. \"Nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drank my beer and listened to Garrett tinkering with hardware. Finally he got the hard drive connected with a loose collection of multicoloured spaghetti and clacked a few commands on his keyboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, yeah,\" he said. \"Give it a few minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe toggled to one of his other processors—Garrett has eight, just in case he wants to have a dinner party someday. The screen dimmed, then came up with gray World Wide Web page. The lights of his ISDN router flickered on. He clacked a few more commands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you working on these days?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bastards running RNI,\" Garrett complained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery time Garrett talks about the company, he starts with that comment, even though he\u0027s been there so long and accumulated so many stock options he is one of the bastards running RNI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027ve got me doing the GUI on an account management program. I make this piece of shit program look really slick, except it still crashes when it merges field data.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So that\u0027s what they\u0027re paying you for,\" I said. \"What are you really working on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett smiled, not taking his eyes off the screen. \"Bring the tequila from the kitchen and I\u0027ll show you. It requires tequila.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not one to refuse a direct order. I got the bottle from the kitchen and poured some for both of us. My brother and I share an understanding about tequila—it should be Herradura Anejo and it should be drunk straight, no lime or salt, preferably in large quantities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe parrot was perched on the edge of a bar stool, looking at the shot glasses enviously, his head cocked to one side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, no,\" I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I got back to the recliner Garrett had a new program up and ready to demonstrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay,\" he said. \"Say you\u0027ve got some material that\u0027s too sensitive to store on your computer. What do you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrugged. \"Hide it on a disk somewhere. Use a read/write protect program on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but disks can be found, and if somebody\u0027s good they can break into them with a logic diagram of the disk drive. Or a password tumbler. Disks can also get destroyed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you boomerang it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe selected a file called Garrett.jpg.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here\u0027s my sensitive data—my picture I want to keep but I don\u0027t want anybody to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I don\u0027t keep it myself—I let the net keep it for me. I upload that sucker, encrypt it so it\u0027s invisible and innocuous, then program it to bounce around randomly, transferring itself from server to server so it\u0027s never in the same place for more than five minutes. It bounces around the net, impossible to find, until I send the retrieval code out for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it comes home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe clicked on the file and we watched it disappear into the net, erasing itself from the hard drive as it uploaded. Then Garrett punched in a series of numbers. Two minutes later the file downloaded itself back into existence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See that?\" he said. \"The sucker was in Norway. By the time anybody noticed it was there, it\u0027d be on its way to somewhere else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe picture opened. It showed Garrett sitting in a bar somewhere with a woman on his lap. She had jeans and a motorcycle helmet and a HarleyDavidson Tshirt that she had pulled up to reveal some very ample breasts. Garrett was toasting the camera with a bottle of Budweiser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Family photos,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Biker women,\" he said fondly. \"They understand there are some things only a man with no legs can do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried not to use my imagination. Another shot of tequila helped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA red light flickered in the corner of the computer and Garrett said, \"It\u0027s soup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe toggled back to the processor that had been giving Julie Kearnes\u0027 hard drive the Spanish Inquisition. On the screen now was a text document, mostly intact. Only a few nonsense characters attested to its trip through the cyber trash can.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Names and social security numbers,\" Garrett announced. He scrolled down to the bottom. \"Seven pages. Dates of hiring. Dates of—DOD, what\u0027s that, date of death?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooks like several different companies, big Austin firms. This make any sense to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Company personnel archives—lists of people who died while employed or retired and then died and had their pensions closed out. Looks like about a decade worth of names for almost all the businesses where Julie Kearnes did temp work. She stole this information.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett waved his fingers, unimpressed. \"Amateur. Anybody could download these—no company is going to guard discontinued personnel records very seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut why bother? And then why trash them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about that. An uncomfortable idea started to form somewhere underneath the pleasant buzz of the Herradura. \"Can I get a hard copy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo minutes later I was back in the easy chair with a refill of tequila and seven pages of deceased employee names from all over Austin. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-widower-s-two-step-tres-navarre-2/page-16.html","bookId":2417,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:56 AM"}
