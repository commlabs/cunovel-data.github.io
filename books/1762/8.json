The type of clothes Madame’s guards wear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a long moment we just stare at each other as if we’ve been apart for ages, which maybe we have. He has been beyond reach with angel’s blood since our arrival, and I have been whisked away by Madame at her every free moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ask, “How are you feeling?” at the same time he says, “You look—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sit up in the sea of throw pillows, and he sits beside me, and the lanterns show me the deep bags under his eyes. When I left him this morning, Madame gave Lilac strict instructions to stop the angel’s blood, but he was sleeping, his mouth moving to make words I couldn’t understand. Now, at least, there’s color in his cheeks. His cheeks are flushed, actually. It’s especially warm in this tent, with all the incense sticks Lilac ignited, and the hot, sugary-sweet smell of the candles in the lanterns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How are you feeling?” I ask again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All right,” he says. “For a few minutes I was seeing strange things, but that’s passed now.” His hands are trembling slightly, and I put my hands over them. His skin is a little clammy, but nothing like it was as he lay comatose and shivering beside me. Just the memory makes me cling to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m so sorry,” I whisper. “I haven’t come up with a plan to get us out yet, but I’ve bought us some time, I think. Madame wants me to perform.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Perform?” Gabriel says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t know—something about dancing, maybe. It could be worse.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe says nothing to that. We both know the type of performances the other girls put on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There has to be a way through the gate,” Gabriel whispers. “Or—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Shh. I think I heard something outside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe strain to listen for it, but the rustling I thought I heard doesn’t repeat itself. It could be the wind, or any of Madame’s girls flitting about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust in case, I move on to a safer topic. “How did you know I’d be here?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There was a little girl waiting for me to wake up. She handed me these clothes and told me to look for the red tent.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t help it. I wrap my arms around him and crush myself against him. “I was so worried.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe response is a soft kiss against the hollow of my neck, his hands sweeping the hair over my shoulders. It has been too much to lie beside him every night, feeling a rag doll’s emptiness, to have the fragmented dreams of June Beans on silver trays and winding mansion hallways and hedge maze paths that took me no nearer to his presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I feel the full weight of him. And it’s making me greedy, making me tilt my head so that his kisses to my neck reach my lips, and making me take him with me as I lean back into the pillows that clatter with beads. A gemstone button is pressing into my back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smoke of the incense is alive. It traces the length of us. The heady perfume of it makes my eyes water, and I feel strange. Weary and flushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait,” I say when Gabriel slides the strap of my slip down my shoulder. “Doesn’t this feel weird to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Weird?” He kisses me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swear the smoke has doubled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a rustling sound on the other side of the tent, and I bolt upright, startled. Gabriel blinks, his arm coiled around mine, sweat trickling from his dampened hair. Something has happened. Some kind of spell. Some supernatural pull. I’m certain this can be the only explanation. There’s the feeling of returning from someplace far.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I hear Madame’s unmistakable cackling. She pushes into the tent, clapping, her white smile floating in the smog. She’s saying something in broken-sounding French as she stomps on the incense sticks to extinguish them. “Merveilleux!” she cries. “Lilac, how many was that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLilac slips into the tent, sorting through a wad of dollar bills. “Ten, Madame,” she says. “The rest complained they couldn’t see through the slit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorrified, I hear male voices grumbling their disappointment on the other side of the tent. Amid a curtain of beads I can see a deliberate slit in the tent. I swallow a scream, cover myself by hugging a pink silk pillow to my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel’s jaw tenses, and I put my hand on his knee, hoping it will quiet him. Whatever Madame was planning, we must play along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aphrodisiacs are quite potent, aren’t they?” Madame says, reaching into a lantern and snuffing the flame with her finger and thumb. “Yes, you put on quite a show.” She’s looking at me when she adds, “Men will pay great money to see what they can’t touch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 5\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE LOVEBIRDS, she calls us. LES TOURTEREAUX is painted in red cursive on a broken plank from an old fence. She is building a cage from bits of rusted wire and coat hangers. She has Gabriel bend the lengths of wire into curves and paint them with a coating I’ve spent the morning mixing from gold eye shadow, water, and paste. The girls are not happy to forfeit their gold makeup. They shove me as they pass; their lifeless eyes bore into me; they mutter words I can’t hear, spitting on the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’re jealous,” Lilac says, a pin in her lips as she sews ruffles onto a white shirt. “New blood and whatnot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re huddled in the red tent, and I’m dunking gray feathers onto a galvanized bucket of blue dye and then fastening them with clothespins to a makeshift clothesline to dry. I wonder what type of bird had to die for this cause. A pigeon or seagull, I’d guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dye stains my fingers, lands in fat drops on the threadbare oversize shirt that makes up my entire outfit. Madame will not have dye spilling onto her good clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, no, no!” Madame cries, bursting into the tent and shaking all its walls. “You’re making a mess of those feathers, girl.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I told you I didn’t know what I was doing,” I mumble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No matter.” Madame grabs my arm and pulls me to my feet. “I wanted to speak to you anyway. Lilac will finish your gown.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLilac mutters something I can’t hear, and Madame kicks a clod of dirt at her, making her cough onto the ruffled shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s a washbasin and a dress laid out for you in the green tent,” Madame says. “Make yourself presentable and meet me by the wheel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith effort I’m able to scrub most of the dye from my fingers. Some of it is trapped along my cuticles, outlining my nails in blue, making my hands look like sketches of themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I meet up with Madame, the Ferris wheel is slowly turning. “The gears have to warm up in this chill,” Madame says, wrapping a knitted shawl around my shoulders. “But we have things to discuss,” she goes on. “Things that would be overheard on the ground.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJared pulls a lever, and the wheel comes to a stop with a car waiting for us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame ushers me ahead and then climbs in after me. The car rocks and creaks as we ascend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have remarkable shoulder blades,” Madame says. I can’t tell what type of accent she’s trying for today. “And your back shows just the right amount of spine. Not too knotted. Subtle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were watching me change,” I say. It’s not a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t bother denying it. “I need to know what I’m selling.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you selling?” I say, daring to look away from my clenched fist and at her smoke-shrouded face. Embers flit on the wind, and I feel their tiny pinches on my bare knee. Up high, away from the device Jared uses to warm the earth, it’s blustery cold. My nose is starting to drip. I hug the shawl around my shoulders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ve told you,” she says. “An illusion.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiles, her eyes dark and faraway as she traces her finger down the slope of my cheek. Her voice is low and sweet. “Soon you’ll crumple into yourself. The flesh will melt from your bones. You’ll scream and cry until it’s done. You have less than a handful of years.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI ignore the imagery. It is easiest to overlook the truth sometimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will you charge admission for that?” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No,” she sighs, and tosses her spent cigarette over the edge. She looks small and incomplete without it. “I intend to make my customers forget these ugly things. No one will look at you and think about your expiration date. They will see youth stretching out like a canyon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can’t help it. I look down. Most of the girls are sleeping through the day, but a few of them are up and about, bossing the children, tending the weedy gardens, flaunting themselves before the bodyguards for a bit of attention. Anything they can do to feel that they’re alive. All of them hating me for being so high over their heads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll put on a good show for me, won’t you?” Madame says. “There is only one rule. You and your boy must behave as if you are alone. My customers will not want to be seen. They are not behind the walls but are the walls themselves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea of performing for “the walls” gives me no comfort. But I only need to play along until I find an escape, and there are worse things than being trapped in a makeshift birdcage with Gabriel, pretending we’re alone. Right? My throat feels dry and swollen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame reaches into the infinite bright scarves draped over her chest and pulls out a small silver compact. She opens it, revealing a single pink pill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI eye it warily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s to prevent pregnancy,” she says. “There are lots of fake pills going around since the birth control ban, but I have a reliable seller. Manufactures them himself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs though to mock us, a child screeches as one of the Reds drags her past the Ferris wheel by the hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t waste them on all my girls, of course,” Madame says. “Only the useful ones. I shudder to think what other horrors would fall from Lilac’s womb if I let her reproduce again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLilac. Cynical and lovely and intelligent. She’s a good mother, I think. As good as one can be in this place, and to a child like Maddie. But she hides this fact when the customers come in the evenings. She is one of the most sought after, and only offered to men who pay the highest price—first generations with the best-paying jobs, mostly. Madame told me this with pride. And yet, Lilac has not had a child since Maddie. I suppose the pink pill could be to thank for that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I don’t want to take it. How can I trust anything in this place? Even the scents in the air can make me behave strangely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame forces it into my mouth. “Swallow,” she says, her sharp painted fingernail gagging the back of my throat. I struggle and jerk my head back, and the pill has been swallowed before I can register what’s just happened. It hurts going down. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fever-the-chemical-garden-2/page-8.html","bookId":1762,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:24:19 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:24:19 AM"}
