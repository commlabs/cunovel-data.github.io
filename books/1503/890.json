Once the Sidhe Empress had passed on, the Ancient Tree of Life would automatically return to its original state. When the Ancient Tree of Life evolved to its current state, it gained one more ability - producing the Seed of Life.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"box-sizing: inherit; font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"box-sizing: inherit; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eBefore they took part in the Grand Tournament of Saint Lands, the Sidhe Empress had already made full preparations; it was either success or death. Firstly it was because her life was connected to Zhou Weiqing’s - in the event Zhou Weiqing died in the battle, it was impossible for her to survive without him. More importantly, it was because of responsibility - the responsibility of sealing the Lord of the Nether. Even if the Sidhe Empress were to perish together with the Ancient Tree of Life during the battle, the Seed of Life was still able to produce another new Ancient Tree of Life. Even though nurturing it might be a long process, at least it would not influence the survival of the Sidhe Tribe. This was also the reason why the Sidhe Empress instructed the elders to relocate to the Heavenly Bow Empire, where the Peerless Sect resided, if anything were to happen to her, before she left for the abyss where the seal of the Netherworld was.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"box-sizing: inherit; font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"box-sizing: inherit; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eAt this very moment, the shocking appearance of the Ancient Tree of Life had forcefully sustained the entire seal once again with its extremely massive Life Energy.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"box-sizing: inherit; font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"box-sizing: inherit; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe Sidhe Empress’ calm voice echoed within the cave, “Lord of the Nether, you were right.

I can’t hold on for too long,” said the Sidhe Empress, whose voice was filled with anxiety.

The enormous pair of pincers were digging their way out of the seal’s formation, bit by bit.

If Fen Tian managed to kill Zhou Weiqing and Tian’er earlier, he would have had successfully broken the seal. Even though the Dragon Emperor was fatally injured, the seal of the Netherworld had lasted for millennia - it accumulated a massive amount of energy that could not be broken that easily. After the core of the formation had been destroyed, he still had to mobilize a large amount of energy in order to have a chance at breaking it in one go.

Even though it was still not the actual Creation Energy, the only difference was that it was slightly less pure in comparison. Even though the Lord of the Nether knew that Zhou Weiqing was unable to become the Creation God as it was impossible for him to possess Creation Energy, the Lord of the Nether was still fearful at this moment. This was because he, who was the most familiar with the seal, knew for a fact that if Zhou Weiqing was at the core of the formation and used his Saint Energy to complete the seal once again, the seal of the Netherworld would become a perfect one, without the slightest flaw.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"box-sizing: inherit; font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"box-sizing: inherit; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eEven if he were to secretly open a crack from the other side of the seal, it would still seal up after the seal had been perfected.

If that were to happen, it was as good as announcing his death sentence. Currently, his biggest regret was that he did not notice the existence of someone who possessed the actual Saint Energy earlier, and kill him before he became stronger. Till now, he was still adamant that his plan was perfect, excluding the unexpected variable, which was Zhou Weiqing’s appearance. And right now this variable had become so strong that it threatened his own existence. How was it possible for him not to feel resentful?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"box-sizing: inherit; font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"box-sizing: inherit; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eSuddenly, the Lord of the Nether’s pincers had stopped moving. Thereafter, a tiny black ball of light appeared in the middle of the two pincers. In order to destroy the seal and prevent it from getting completed again, he had exerted his personal source of energy. This source of energy had been refined over millennia, and it was only a small amount. However, at this moment, the Lord of the Nether could not afford to care so much about it. As long as he was able to break the seal and get to the Boundless Mainland, he would be able to restore his energy. He was very ambitious - he wanted to use the Boundless Mainland as a stepping stone to strengthen his body, before achieving his goal of devouring the entire universe and becoming the sole ruler.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"box-sizing: inherit; font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"box-sizing: inherit; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eThe pitch-black light was filled with endless darkness. The ball of light continuously grew bigger and the terrifying Destructive Energy within it had formed a dark green light curtain. Regardless of Zhou Weiqing’s Saint Energy or the Sidhe Empress’ Life Saint Energy, they were unable to penetrate it. The moment they came into contact with the dark green light curtain, they would disintegrate immediately.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp style\u003d\"box-sizing: inherit; font-weight: 400; border: 0px; font-style: normal; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"box-sizing: inherit; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: 400; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"\u003eSensing the Destructive Energy within the black light ball that was continuously expanding, Zhou Weiqing trembled in fear. This was because he could clearly sense that it was the purest Destructive Energy that ever existed in this world that could truly rival Creation Energy. It was a powerful energy that he was completely unable to resist. Even though his Saint Energy was considered to be extremely pure, it would automatically vanish upon coming into contact with the aura that was released by this source of Destructive Energy. Furthermore, even the Creation characteristics within the Saint Energy was completely destroyed by it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-28-chapter-303-2\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-28-chapter-304-1\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heavenly-jewel-change/hjc-book-28-chapter-303-3","bookId":1503,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:15 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:15 AM"}
