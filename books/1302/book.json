It was first published as a hardcover in 1897 by Archibald Constable and Co. Dracula has been attributed to many literary genres including vampire literature, horror fiction, the gothic novel and invasion literature. Structurally it is an epistolary novel, that is, told as a series of letters, diary entries, ships\u0027 logs, etc. Literary critics have examined many themes in the novel, such as the role of women in Victorian culture, conventional and conservative sexuality, immigration, colonialism, postcolonialism and folklore. Although Stoker did not invent the vampire, the novel\u0027s influence on the popularity of vampires has been singularly responsible for many theatrical, film and television interpretations throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/dracula.jpg","author":"Bram Stoker","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/dracula.html","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:49 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:36:20 AM"}
