When the doors opened, Luca and his team piled out and followed the guard to the operating suite.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man pointed to a pair of double doors. \"The amphitheater\u0027s through there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s where they\u0027re transmitting from?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guard nodded. \"But the cameras are upstairs - through that door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Any other way out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca ripped the guard\u0027s two-way off his belt and flung it against the tiles of the nearest wall. \"Stand over there and don\u0027t get in the way.\" He signaled to Lowery. \"You and Majesky take the stairs. The rest of you - with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe depressed the bolt catch release lever on his HK to chamber the first round and stepped toward the doors. He didn\u0027t expect resistance, but it never hurt to be prepared. And besides, he knew of no better attention getter than a three-round burst into the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kicked open the doors and stepped through. \"All right - !\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmpty. The place looked like a cyclone had ripped through it, but not a soul in sight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the - ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned, ready to go out and bang that guard\u0027s head against the wall for sending them to the wrong room when he noticed the shape under the bloody sheet on the table. Three quick steps took him to it. He hesitated, then reached out and pulled it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dead sim, bloody, carved open from chest to groin. Looked like Jack the Ripper had been at her. He saw the gaping belly, the empty uterus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pregnant sim...this had to be her...but where - ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, no...oh, no...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis knees felt gelatinous, his arms weak, the HK a hundred-pound weight in his hands as he turned and saw the TV monitor - where the operation was still in progress...at this table...on this sim...right in this room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d fooled him...played him for a grade-A-prime sucker...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up toward the spinning ceiling, saw a camera pointed his way from the balcony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lowery?\" he whispered into his comm mike. \"Lowery, what\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA helmeted head popped into view next to the camera. \"They\u0027re running a movie of the operation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it, Lowery,\" he said, softly at first but with his voice rising. \"Stop it right now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know how!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, you do, goddamn you!\" He was screaming now. \"Yes, you fucking well do!Now do it! \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, okay!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuca heard the clinking release of the bolt on Lowery\u0027s submachine gun, followed by one three-round burst, then another. The monitor went blank...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e...but its final image had been Patrick Sullivan holding up a very human-looking baby girl...and Luca remembered how the Sinclairs had feared the birth of a girl...and he also remembered all that crap he\u0027d read about inter- and intragenomic competition...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took him a moment to piece it all together, but then suddenly he knew what had terrified them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou slimy bastards!
