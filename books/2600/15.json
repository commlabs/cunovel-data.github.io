Had it really only been twenty-four hours since Allen had been here to supervise Evergreen\u0027s strange delivery? It seemed a lifetime ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he would get answers. He would make Evergreen give him answers. After all Allen had been through, he could not find the brusque professor intimidating anymore. The guy owed him an explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe entered Evergreen\u0027s building and knocked on his apartment door. No answer. He knocked again. \"Professor Evergreen?\" He tried the knob. It was open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Professor?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen noticed the suitcases straightaway, stacked in the entranceway next to an old-fashioned-looking steamer trunk. So they\u0027d arrived. Good. Allen stepped into the apartment. The large crate Evergreen had been so concerned about was nowhere in sight. In a swivel chair across the room, Evergreen sat at a desk with his back to Allen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Professor Evergreen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvergreen didn\u0027t turn around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen spotted the headphones, the wire leading to the MP3 player on the desk. Evergreen probably had the volume up to max and hadn\u0027t heard Allen knock or enter the apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, man. Time to do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen crossed the room, tapped the big man on the shoulder, raised his voice. \"Professor Evergreen. We need to talk. A lot of strange fucking shit has happened since I got here and-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvergreen toppled over, slid from the chair, and landed at Allen\u0027s feet. His skin was as white as notebook paper. His eyes stared at the ceiling and his mouth hung open, tongue halfway out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen hopped back. \"Fuck!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA ragged pink crater in the side of Evergreen\u0027s neck, like somebody had taken a giant bite of undercooked ham.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen swallowed hard. \"Oh, man. That\u0027s not cool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe backed to the center of the room, turned his head from side to side. What the fuck had happened here? Allen should call somebody. The local police, maybe. Or he could turn and haul ass. Why would anyone do this to the professor? Yeah, most of his students pretty much thought he was a dick... but this?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light coming from the balcony dimmed, as if a dark cloud had passed in front of the sun. Allen went cold. The hair on his neck stood straight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice so familiar it made Allen gasp. He stood frozen, wanting to back out of the room, but something sapped his will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time he turned his head, looked toward the half-open door of the apartment\u0027s master bedroom. The lights were off. A cold breeze picked up and came through the open balcony doors, tugged at Allen\u0027s hair and clothing. He thought he could just make out the shape of someone back in the dark bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is it?\" But Allen knew who it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allen, come in here, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen spoke slowly, like he was having trouble remembering how words worked. \"Maybe you should come out here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need you, Allen, need you to help me. Please. Come to me.\" There in the darkness. The eyes. They latched onto him. \"Come to me, Allen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head. \"No.\" But he\u0027d taken a step forward. His other foot moved. Another step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crossed into the darkness. Even with his head in a fog he noticed that the windows had all been covered with thick blankets. The room smelled of moist earth. She stood right in front of him now. The wind gusted behind him, and the bedroom door clicked shut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allen,\" she said in a voice of clear crystal. \"I need your help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs. Evergreen, your husband is dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Allen. I know. It was such a long trip, so hungry. I just couldn\u0027t wait. You must try to imagine how it was. You can imagine it, can\u0027t you? The longing and the need until nothing else matters. Nothing matters but satisfaction, and it burns, you need it so bad. Such a shame. So many plans. He\u0027d brought me so far. I don\u0027t think he minded in the end. If it helps you to think of it like that, Allen, I don\u0027t think he minded at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about, Mrs. Evergreen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to call me Cassandra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen did not want to call her that. But he said it. \"Cassandra.\" The word tasted good in his mouth, delicious and painful. Like Thai food.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put a cool hand on his arm. Her eyes filled the room, the rest of her face and body only vague shapes in the darkness. \"He can\u0027t help me anymore, Allen. I need you. I need you to go a place I can\u0027t go. You will do this for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. He opened his mouth to deny her, but the words that came out were, \"I will help you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was right up against him now. He felt her along the length of him, his breathing so shallow, head dizzy. He realized she was naked. Her hands roamed him. He stood still as a statue, afraid and enthralled and wanting her. She rubbed his erection, and her lips brushed his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt faint. Felt like he was floating out of his own body. No. He needed his body. Wanted it to do things to her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassandra ripped off his shirt. She hissed and backed away, pointing at his chest. Anger flashed in her eyes. \"Get rid of that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen\u0027s hand went to his chest, felt the cold metal of the crucifix hanging there. \"This?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Throw it away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen pulled it over his head, and cocked his arm to toss it out of the room. Hesitated. Something-faces flashing before his mind\u0027s eye-stopped him. Father Paul. Penny. He couldn\u0027t throw it away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Allen.\" Waves of pure sex radiated from Cassandra\u0027s naked body. \"I\u0027m waiting for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen tossed the crucifix over his shoulder, heard it rattle and clank somewhere out of the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat followed was a patchwork of sensations and memory. He was naked and on top of her, her back arched, mouth open, animal growls coming out of her. Long fingernails raked his back. Then she was on top. Had hours passed or minutes? The eyes. Always the eyes burning, branding her ownership of him onto his soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlong his inner thigh, a white-hot intensity, her mouth on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the pleasure flooded back again, arms and legs wrapping him up, like she was trying to climb inside. A tangle of sheets. Relentless pleasure, sapping him, leaving him a spent husk. Exhausting, pulling him down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen gave himself to exquisite oblivion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe awoke to the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen sat up in bed, clueless where he was until patchy images clanged and tumbled through his brain. The windows had been thrown open, the curtains fluttering on a gentle breeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cassandra.\" He looked, but she wasn\u0027t there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore memories, as they lay together in the darkness, her hot breath on his ear as she whispered his instructions. Somehow her words penetrated his fogged brain. He knew what he had to do to serve her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was way too naked. He saw his clothes on the floor and stood, winced at the slight pain in his thigh. He stood with legs apart, bent over to examine himself. Two dark punctures along his thigh about six inches from his scrotum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scratched his head, rubbed his eyes. Where am I?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe dressed himself. Every muscle ached. He grunted as he put on his shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack into the living room, and he saw The Professor\u0027s dead body still where it had fallen. Oh, yeah. He\u0027s dead. That fact no longer seemed very urgent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething cut through the haze of his programming, some prick of curiosity. Yes, he had his mission. He should get on with it, but he looked around the apartment, wondered. Where was the large wooden crate?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe headed for the second bedroom and walked into it. Completely dark. He felt along the wall for the light switch, found it, and flipped it on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe room was barren of furnishings. There was only the crate in the dead center. The lid had been pried off and sat to one side. Allen approached, looked inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw an open casket with silk lining and a pillow for the comfort of the deceased. Between the crate and the casket, moist dark earth had been packed in tight, completely surrounding the outside of the casket. Allen\u0027s hand went to his throat. He stood there a moment, putting two and two together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran out of the bedroom, darted into the bathroom, flipped on the light switch. He stood in front of the mirror, lifting his chin, feeling along his throat. Only smooth skin. He let his hand wander down to rub his thigh and considered the marks there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pictured the chunk that had been bitten out of Professor Evergreen\u0027s throat. He shivered. The man staring back at him in the mirror looked like a pale, shadow-eyed wraith. Some deranged derelict.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllen left the bathroom, stumbled from the apartment, downstairs and into the street. The night was cool. Distantly he heard voices, somewhere a dog barking. He realized he was walking. Somehow his feet knew the right direction. South and west.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStrahov Monastery. The words had been put into his brain. So many words and images jumbling together, instructions and books and names and places all mixed up with a picture of himself, arms wrapped around Mrs. Evergreen-Cassandra!-her legs around him, heels digging into his ass, so many grunts and moans and just so much relentless thrusting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked through the night, all of this information like a buzz in his brain growing louder and louder. Two words above all others throbbed within his cranium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEdward Kelley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHIRTY\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWake up, bitch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl on the couch blinked, rubbed her eyes, focused on the other girl standing over her, hands on hips. Penny was doing her best to sound simultaneously pissed and accusatory, with a hint of righteous indignation thrown in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you do with him?\" Penny jabbed a finger at the witch. \"And don\u0027t mess with me. I\u0027m a lot tougher than I look.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy sat up, shook the cobwebs out of her head. \"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pay attention, blondie. Where\u0027s Allen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy stifled a yawn. \"Is there any coffee?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t fucking Denny\u0027s. I asked what you did with Allen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt registered in Amy\u0027s eyes what Penny was asking. She sat straight, suddenly alert. \"Allen\u0027s missing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Duh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened to him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I\u0027m asking you,\" Penny said. \"I let you guys sleep because you were wiped out, but I just looked in on him and he\u0027s not there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy stood, went to the bedroom, and looked inside. \"No signs of a struggle. Did he leave a note?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny frowned. \"Are you trying to say you didn\u0027t have anything to do with his being gone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why would I still be sleeping on your couch if I\u0027d called my people to come kidnap him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny shrugged. \"Hey, I don\u0027t pretend to understand your cloak-and-dagger bullshit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re coming off a bit hostile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See? That\u0027s what I mean.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Two years!\" Penny held up two fingers. \"Two damn years I\u0027ve been working on that boy. I nursed him back from the edge after he broke up with that Goth whore Brenda. Two damn years invested, and you come along with your blond hair and suntan and tight little ass and get your hooks into him in twenty-four hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do not know what you are talking about.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hell you don\u0027t.\" Penny folded her hands under her chin and batted her eyelashes. \"Oh, my. I\u0027m just so tired. Let me climb into this tiny narrow bunk next to you with nothing but a towel on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy frowned. \"Hey!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not doing the soft sell anymore,\" Penny said. \"Allen\u0027s mine, and that had better be crystal clear right now or somebody\u0027s going to get hurt. And I don\u0027t mean me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that a threat? Are you actually threatening me? Do you know who I am, what I can do to you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny\u0027s grin was pure wicked. \"And you don\u0027t know anything about me either, blondie. I can turn your day real bad real quick.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuscles tensed, both women looking like they might pounce at any second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee, now this is where we should have a totally awesome catfight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave you ever seen two women go at it? I mean, two furious women with blood in their eyes, claws out, teeth bared? It\u0027s pretty hot. Lots of long hair thrashing around and clothes getting ripped off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I were in charge of such things, it would be catfight time. But I have no such power to manipulate the universe. Alas, my role has been relegated to that of observer. And reporter. The cosmos has put me into this position for the sake of posterity. It doesn\u0027t mean I don\u0027t enjoy the occasional naked catfight. Not this time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, this happened:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy held up her hands, took a step back, and exhaled. \"Whoa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHold on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny eyed her with suspicion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not after Allen,\" Amy said. \"Not like that. Hey, I understand what it looked like. Sorry about that. But my only concern is keeping some very powerful magic out of the wrong hands. Nothing else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s all Father Paul wants too,\" Penny insisted. \"And he said he wants to keep Allen from getting hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait. Hold on. You talked to the priest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh...\" Penny bit her bottom lip, looked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmy backed away, tensed, glanced at the doors and windows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my God. Are they coming here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Penny said quickly. \"No, I... I didn\u0027t think Allen would want me to do that. As a matter of fact, I went in to wake him up so I could talk him into seeing Father Paul. I wanted to convince Allen he could help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, yeah? Like your priest helped back at the safe house. With machine guns.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They were trying to rescue Allen because you kidnapped him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is getting us nowhere,\" Amy said. \"Did you mean it when you said you didn\u0027t tell the priests Allen was here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t told my people either,\" Amy said. \"So let\u0027s say we\u0027re both being fair and honest. Who does that leave to help Allen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny narrowed her eyes at the witch. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean he\u0027s out there somewhere. If the Society didn\u0027t snatch him, and if the priests didn\u0027t take him, then where is he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny frowned. She was trying to think it through. \"You think he left on his own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. Maybe he was trying to get away from me, or maybe he just didn\u0027t want to put you in danger. But right now we\u0027re the only people who can help him. Neither one of us wants to see him hurt. Let\u0027s put our heads together and go find him.\" Amy offered her hand. \"How about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePenny eyed the outstretched hand a little longer than was probably polite. She took it, and they shook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to need a cup of coffee,\" Amy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a place down the street,\" Penny told her. \"Let\u0027s move.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-a-go-go/page-15.html","bookId":2600,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:05 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:28:05 PM"}
