Or you who are slanderous enough to include such charges in your indictment? For sportive effusions in verse are valueless as evidence of a poetâ€™s morals. Have you not read Catullus, who replies thus to those who wish him ill:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA virtuous poet must be chaste. Agreed.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut for his verses there is no such need.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe divine Hadrian, when he honoured the tomb of his friend the poet Voconius with an inscription in verse from his own pen, wrote thus:\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThy verse was wanton, but thy soul was chaste,\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ewords which he would never have written had he regarded verse of somewhat too lively a wit as proving their author to be a man of immoral life. I remember that I have read not a few poems by the divine Hadrian himself which were of the same type. Come now, Aemilianus, I dare you to say that that was ill done which was done by an emperor and censor, the divine Hadrian, and once done was recorded for subsequent generations.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut, apart from that, do you imagine that Maximus will censure anything that has Plato for its model, Plato whose verses, which I have just read, are all the purer for being frank, all the more modest for being outspoken? For in these matters and the like, dissimulation and concealment is the mark of the sinner, open acknowledgement and publication a sign that the writer is but exercising his wit. For nature has bestowed on innocence a voice wherewith to speak, but to guilt she has given silence to veil its sin.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/638/1064.html","bookId":274,"creation":"Aug 1, 2019 8:24:24 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 8:24:24 AM"}
