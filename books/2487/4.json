What?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMolly came by just then, trotting along like everything was just A-OK in Dogland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she noticed some meat standing nearby and started happily chewing on a six-inch-wide tube of bologna serving as the thing’s ankle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“AARRRRRGHHHH!!!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt dropped me to the floor. I scrambled to my feet and ran downstairs. The meat man followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the foot of the stairs, John was waiting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was holding the stereo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monster stopped halfway down the staircase, its eyeless turkey head staring down the device in John’s hands, as if recognizing the danger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, how that Old Testament demon must have howled and shrieked at the sight of young David’s harp, seeing at work a form of ancient magic that can pierce any darkness. The walking meat horror knew what was coming, that the same power was about to be tapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn nodded, as if to say, “Checkmate.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed the “play” button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSound filled the room, a crystal melody that could lift any human heart and turn away any devil.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was “Here I Go Again” by Whitesnake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe monster grabbed the spots on the turkey where its ears would be and fell to its knees. John wielded the stereo before him like a holy talisman, stepping up the stairs, driving the sound closer to the beast. Every inch of its fat-marbled skin and gristle writhed in agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take it!” John screamed, suddenly emboldened. “It looks like you should have taken time to beef up your defenses!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beast grabbed its abdomen; in pain, I thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead it pried loose a canned ham and, before John could react, hurled it at the stereo, the can whizzing through the air like a Randy Johnson fastball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirect hit. Sparks and bits of plastic flew. The stereo tumbled out of John’s hands and fell heavily to the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDisarmed, John hopped down to the floor as the beast rose to its feet and pursued. It grabbed John by the neck. It snatched at me, but I dodged and grabbed the coffee thermos from the table. I ran back with the thermos, spun off the top and dashed the contents at the meaty arm that held John.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe meatstrocity screamed. The arm smoked and bubbled, then burst into flame. The limb then blackened and peeled off from the socket, falling to the hardwood below. John was free, falling to his knees and gasping for air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beast howled, collapsing to the floor meatily. With its only remaining arm, it pointed at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll never defeat me, Marconi! I have sealed this house with my powers. You cannot escape!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped, put my hands on my hips and strode up to it. “Marconi? As in, Doctor-slash-Father Albert Marconi? The guy who hosts Magical Mysteries on the Discovery Channel?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn stepped over and glared at the wounded thing. “You dumbass. Marconi is fifty years old. He has white hair. Dave and I aren’t that old combined. Your nemesis is probably off giving some seminar, standing waist-deep in a pile of his own money.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing turned its turkey at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell ya what,” I offered. “If I can get you in touch with Marconi so you two can work out your little differences, will you release us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You lie!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I can’t get him down here, but surely a being as superhumanly powerful as you can destroy him at a distance, right? Here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt watched me as I fished out my cell phone and dialed. After talking to a secretary, a press agent, a bodyguard, an operator, the secretary again and finally a personal assistant, I got through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is Marconi. My secretary says you have some kind of a meat monster there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. Hold on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI offered the phone to Meaty. “Do we have a deal?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing stood up, hesitated, then finally nodded its turkey up and down. I held out the phone, while giving John a dark look that I hoped conveyed the fact that Plan B involved me letting the monster beat the shit out of him while I tried to escape out of a window somewhere. Fucking girl and her “ghost boyfriend.” Marconi would have seen this shit coming a mile away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bundle of sausage fingers took the phone from my hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So!” it boomed into the receiver. “We meat again, Marconi. You thought you had vanquished me but I—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe beast spontaneously combusted into a ball of unholy blue light. With a shriek that pierced my ears, it left our world. The lifeless meat slapped to the floor piece by piece, the cell phone clattering next to the pile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Damn, he’s good,” said John. I walked over and picked up the cell phone. I put it to my ear to ask the doctor what he had done, but it was the secretary again. I switched it off. The doctor hadn’t even hung around long enough to say hello.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn made a casual hand-dusting motion. “Well. That was pretty stupid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried the front door and it opened easily. Who knows, maybe it had never been sealed. We took time to straighten up the place, not finding any Morrisons restrained or dismembered and figuring that “Shelly” was at least telling the truth when she said the real family was on vacation. The shit had vanished from the basement, but I couldn’t fix the heating duct I had messed up earlier. We packed the meat back into the freezer as best we could, with one exception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was already dissolving the night sky by the time I got home. I opened up the toolshed and set the broken boom box inside. I found an empty jar, filled it from a square can of formaldehyde and dropped the deer tongue in. I placed it on the shelf next to a stuffed monkey paw, lying lifeless with two fingers extended. I locked up and went to bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—from the journal of David Wong\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBook 1: They China Food\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Levitating “Jamaican”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHEY SAY LOS Angeles is like The Wizard of Oz. One minute it’s small-town monochrome neighborhoods and then boom—all of a sudden you’re in a sprawling Technicolor freak show, dense with midgets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, this story does not take place in Los Angeles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place I was sitting was a small city in the Midwest which will remain undisclosed for reasons that will become obvious later. I was at a restaurant called “They China Food!” which was owned by a couple of brothers from the Czech Republic who, as far as I could tell, didn’t know a whole lot about China or food. I had picked the place thinking it was still the Mexican bar and grill it had been the previous month; in fact, the change was so recent that one wall was still covered by an incompetent mural of a dusky woman riding a bull and proudly flying the flag of Mexico, carrying a cartoon burrito the size of a pig under her arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a small city, large enough to have four McDonald’s but not so big that you see more than the occasional homeless person on the way. You can get a taxi here but they’re not out roving around where you can jump off the sidewalk and hail one. You have to call them on the phone, and they’re not yellow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe weather varies explosively from day to day in this part of America, the jet stream undulating over us like an angry snake god. I’ve seen a day when the temperature hit one hundred and eight degrees, another when it dipped eighteen degrees below zero, another day when the temperature swung forty-three degrees in eight hours. We’re also in Tornado Alley, so every spring swirling, howling charcoal demons materialize out of the air and shred mobile homes as if they were dropped in huge blenders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut all that aside, it’s not a bad town. Not really.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of unemployment, though. We’ve got two closed factories and a rotting shopping mall that went bankrupt before it ever opened. We’re not far from Kentucky, which marks the unofficial border to the South, so one sees more than enough pickup trucks decorated with stickers of Confederate flags and slogans proclaiming their brand of truck is superior to all others. Lots of country music stations, lots of jokes that contain the word “nigger.” A sewer system that occasionally backs up into the streets for some unknown reason. Lots and lots of stray dogs around, many with grotesque deformities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOkay, it’s a shithole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a lot of things about this undisclosed city that the chamber of commerce won’t tell you, like the fact that we have more than quadruple the rate of mental illness per capita than any other city in the state, or that in the ‘80s the EPA did a very discreet study of the town’s water supply in hope of finding a cause. The chief inspector on that case was found dead inside one of the water towers a week later, which was considered strange since the largest opening into the tank was a valve just ten inches wide. It was also considered strange that both of his eyes were fused shut, but that’s another story.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy name is David, by the way. Um, hi. I once saw a man’s kidney grow tentacles, tear itself out of a ragged hole in his back and go slapping across my kitchen floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed and stared blankly out of the window of They China Food!, occasionally glancing at the clock sign that flashed 6:32 P.M. in the darkness from the credit union across the street. The reporter was late. I thought about leaving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t want to tell this story, the story of me and John and what’s happening in Undisclosed (and everywhere else, I guess). I can’t tell the story without sounding as nuts as a . . . a nut bush, or—whatever nuts grow from. I pictured myself pouring my heart out to this guy, ranting about the shadows, and the worms, and Korrok, and Fred Durst, babbling away under this wall-sized portrait of a badly drawn burrito. How was this going to turn into anything but a ridiculous clusterfuck?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnough, I said to myself. Just go. When you’re on your deathbed you’re gonna wish you could get back all the time you spent waiting for other people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI started to stand but stopped myself halfway up. My stomach flinched, as if cattle-prodded. I felt another dizzy spell coming on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fell hard back into the booth. More side effects. I was already light-headed, my body trembling from shoes to shoulders in random spells, like I swallowed a vibrator. It’s always like this when I’m on the sauce. I dosed six hours ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took slow, deep breaths, trying to cycle down, to level off, to chill out. I turned to watch a little Asian waitress deliver a plate of chicken fried rice to a bearded guy on the other side of the room. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/john-dies-at-the-end-john-dies-at-the-end-1/page-4.html","bookId":2487,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:38:24 PM"}
