I have brought company with me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Company! Whom can you have met in this wilderness?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “A man whom you used to know in early days.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Not Bradley Wentworth?” said Mr. Lane eagerly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, Bradley Wentworth.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank Heaven! I wanted to see him before I died. Where is he?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Just outside. He is waiting to know if you will see him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, yes; bring him in at once.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Gerald went to the door, and beckoned to Wentworth, who rose immediately and passed into the cabin.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Bradley Wentworth,” said the invalid, looking[23] up excitedly, “I am glad to see you. I thank you for obeying my summons.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even Wentworth, callous to suffering and selfish as he was, was shocked by the fragile appearance of his old companion.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You look very weak,” he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, Bradley. I am very weak. I stand at the portal of the unseen land. My days are numbered. Any day may bring the end.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am shocked to see you in this condition,” and there was momentary feeling in the tone of the world-hardened man.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Don’t pity me! I am not reluctant to die. Gerald, you may leave me alone with Mr. Wentworth for a while. I wish to have some conversation with him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Very well, father.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Have you acquainted him with the incidents of our early life?” asked Bradley Wentworth, referring to Gerald with a frown.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Not until this morning. Then, not knowing but I might be cut off suddenly, and uncertain whether you would answer my call, I told him the story.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Better have left it untold!” said Wentworth with an uneasy look.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Nay, he was entitled to know, otherwise he[24] might not have understood why it was that I had buried him and myself here in this wilderness.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He would have supposed that you came here for your health. I understand that Colorado is very favorable to those having pulmonary diseases.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes, but he was entitled to know my past history. He was entitled to know what a sacrifice I had made—for another.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Bradley Wentworth winced at this allusion, and his forehead involuntarily contracted.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That is your way of looking at it,” he said abruptly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It is the true way of looking at it,” rejoined the sick man firmly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Hush!” said Wentworth, looking apprehensively towards the door of the cabin.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Gerald knows all, and he is the only one to hear. But to resume: I saved you from disgrace and disinheritance. I did so against my wishes, because your need was so great, and you solemnly promised to provide handsomely for me and mine when you came into your fortune.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I was ready to promise anything in my extremity. You took advantage of my position.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The bargain I made was a fair one. It touches but one-sixteenth of the fortune which[25] you inherited. Bradley Wentworth, it was and is a debt of honor!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “To talk of my giving you such a sum is perfect nonsense!” said Wentworth roughly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You did not regard it in that light fifteen years since,” returned the sick man reproachfully.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Of course I admit that you did me a service, and I am ready to pay for it. Give me the papers and I will give you a thousand dollars.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “A thousand dollars in repayment of my great sacrifice! Have riches made you narrow and mean?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Riches have not made me a fool!” retorted Wentworth. “Let me tell you that a thousand dollars is no small sum. It will give that boy of yours a great start in life. It is more than you and I had at his age.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You have a son, have you not?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How would you regard a thousand dollars as a provision for him?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “There is some difference between the position of my son and yours,” said Wentworth arrogantly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You are fortunate if your son equals mine in nobility of character.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Oh, I have no doubt your son is a paragon,[26]” said Wentworth with a sneer. “But to the point! I will give you a thousand dollars and not a cent more.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He had hardly finished this sentence when he started in affright. Warren Lane fell back in his chair in a state of insensibility.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wentworth stepped hastily to the bureau, and opened the drawers one after another in the hope of finding the documents.—Page 27.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2947/80978.html","bookId":465,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 5:29:59 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 5:29:59 AM"}
