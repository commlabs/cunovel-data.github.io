{"id":96584,"no":125,"title":"Page 125","content":"\u003cp\u003eLuis Carruthers is, I suppose, incognito. He\u0027s wearing some kind of jaguar-print silk evening jacket, deerskin gloves, a felt hat, aviator sunglasses, and he\u0027s hiding behind a column, pretending to inspect a row of ties, and, gracelessly, he gives me a sidelong glance. Leaning down, I sign something, a bill I think, and fleetingly Luis\u0027s presence forces me to consider that maybe a life connected to this city, to Manhattan, to my job, is not a good idea, and suddenly I imagine Luis at some horrible party, drinking a nice dry rose, fags clustered around a baby grand, show tunes, now he\u0027s holding a flower, now he has a feather boa draped around his neck, now the pianist bangs out something from Les Miz, darling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Patrick? Is that you?\" I hear a tentative voice inquire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a smash cut from a horror movie - a jump zoom - Luis Carruthers appears, suddenly, without warning, from behind his column, slinking and jumping at the same time, if that\u0027s\u0027 possible. I smile at the salesgirl, then awkwardly move away from him and over to a display case of suspenders, in dire need of a Xanax, a Valium, a Halcion, a Frozfruit, anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t, can\u0027t, look at him, but I sense he\u0027s moved closer to me. His voice confirms it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Patrick?... Hello?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClosing my eyes, I move a hand up to my face and mutter, under my breath, \"Don\u0027t make me say it, Luis.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Patrick?\" he says, feigning innocence. \"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hideous pause, then, \"Patrick... Why aren\u0027t you looking at me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m ignoring you, Luis.\" I breathe in, calming myself by checking the price tag on an Armani button-up sweater. \"Can\u0027t you tell? I\u0027m ignoring you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Patrick, can\u0027t we just talk?\" he asks, almost whining. \"Patrick\u0026nbsp; - look at me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter another sharp intake of breath, sighing, I admit, \"There is nothing, not-hing to talk - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t go on like this,\u0027 he impatiently cuts me off. \"I can\u0027 go on like this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mutter. I start walking away from him. He follows, insistent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway,\" he says, once we\u0027ve reached the other side of the store, where I pretend to look through a row of silk ties but everything\u0027s blurry, \"you\u0027ll be glad to know that I\u0027m transferring... out of state.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething rises off me and I\u0027m able to ask, but still without looking at him, \"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, a different branch,\" he says, sounding remarkably relaxed, probably due to the fact that I actually inquired about the move. \"In Arizona.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ter-riffic,\" I murmur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you want to know why?\" he asks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because of you,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t say that,\" I plead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because of you,\" he says again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are sick,\" I tell him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I\u0027m sick it\u0027s because ofyou,\" he says too casually, checking his nails. \"Because of you I am sick and I will not get better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have distorted this obsession of yours way out of proportion. Way, way out of proportion,\" I say, then move over to another aisle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I know you have the same feelings I do,\" Luis says, trailing me. \"And I know that just because...\" He lowers his voice and shrugs. \"Just because you won\u0027t admit... certain feelings you have doesn\u0027t mean you don\u0027t have them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you trying to say?\" I hiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027That I know you feel the same way I do.\" Dramatically, he whips off his sunglasses, as if to prove a point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have reached... an inaccurate conclusion,\" I choke. \"You are... obviously unsound.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" he asks. \"Is it so wrong to love you, Patrick?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh... my... god.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To want you? To want to be with you?\" he asks. \"Is that so wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can feel him staring helplessly into me, that he\u0027s near total emotional collapse. After he finishes, except for a long silence I have no answer. Finally I counter this by hissing, \"What is this continuing inability you have to evaluate this situation rationally?\" I pause. \"Huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lift my head up from the sweaters, the ties, whatever, and glance at Luis. In that instant he smiles, relieved that I\u0027m acknowledging his presence, but the smile soon becomes fractured and in the dark inner recesses of his fag mind he realizes something and starts crying. When I calmly walk over to a column so I can hide behind it, he follows and roughly grabs my shoulder, spinning me around so I\u0027m facing him: Luis blotting out reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time I ask Luis to \"Go away\" he sobs, \"Oh god, Patrick, why don\u0027t you like me?\" and then, unfortunately, he falls to the floor at my feet. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/american-psycho/page-125.html","bookId":2593,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:50 PM"}
