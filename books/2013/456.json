Back into his office. From down the corridor, someone was screaming about an army in the city, ships crowding the harbour, but none of that mattered now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing mattered but this unconscious man at his feet. Beaten until he barely clung to life. By the Invigilator’s sceptre, his symbol of power, and was that not right? Oh, but it was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas the mob still there? Were they coming in now? An entire wall of the compound had collapsed, after all, nothing and no-one left to stop them. Motion caught his eye and his head snapped round-just another rat in the corridor, slithering past. The Guild. What kind of game were those fools playing? He’d killed dozens of the damned things, so easily crushed under heel or with a savage downward swing of his sceptre.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRats. They were nothing. No different from the mob outside, all those precious citizens who understood nothing about anything, who needed leaders like Karos Invictad to guide them through the world. He adjusted his grip on the sceptre, flakes of blood falling away, his palm seemingly glued to the ornate shaft, but that glue had not set and wouldn’t for a while, would it? Not until he was truly done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was that damned mob? He wanted them to see-this final skull-shattering blow-their great hero, their revolutionary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMartyrs could be dealt with. A campaign of misinformation, rumours of vulgarity, corruption, oh, all that was simple enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood alone, yes, did I not? Against the madness of this day. They will remember that. More than anything else. They will remember that, and everything else I choose to give them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlaying the Empire’s greatest traitor-with my own hand, yes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared down at Tehol Beddict. The battered, split-open face, the shallow breaths that trembled from beneath snapped ribs. He could put a foot down on the man’s chest, settle some weight, until those broken ribs punctured the lungs, left them lacerated, and the red foam would spill out from Tehol’s mashed nose, his torn lips. And, surprise. He would drown after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother rat in the corridor? He turned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sword-point slashed across his stomach. Fluids gushed, organs following. Squealing, Karos Invictad fell to his knees, stared up at the man standing before him, stared up at the crimson-bladed sword in the man’s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No,’ he said in a mumble, ‘but you are dead.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrys Beddict’s calm brown eyes shifted from the Invigilator’s face, noted the sceptre still held in Karos’s right hand. His sword seemed to writhe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurning pain in the Invigilator’s wrist and he looked down. Sceptre was gone. Hand was gone. Blood streamed from the stump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA kick to the chest sent Karos Invictad toppling, trailing entrails that flopped down like an obscene, malformed penis between his legs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached down with his one hand to pull it all back in, but there was no strength left.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid I kill Tehol? Yes, I must have. The Invigilator is a true servant of the empire, and always will be, and there will be statues in courtyards and city squares. Karos Invictad, the hero who destroyed the rebellion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKaros Invictad died then, with a smile on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrys Beddict sheathed his sword, knelt beside his brother, lifted his head into his lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind him, Ormly said, ‘A healer’s on the way.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No need,’ Brys said. And looked up. ‘An Elder God comes.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrmly licked his lips. ‘Saviour-’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cough from Tehol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrys looked down to see his brother’s eyes flick open. One brown, one blue. Those odd eyes stared up at him for a long moment, then Tehol whispered something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrys bent lower. ‘What?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I said, does this mean I’m dead?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘No, Tehol. Nor am I, not any longer, it seems.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Ah. Then…’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Then what?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Death-what’s it like, Brys?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Brys Beddict smiled. ‘Wet.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I always said cities were dangerous places,’ Quick Ben said, brushing plaster dust from his clothes. The collapsing building had nearly flattened them both, and the wizard was still trembling-not from the close call, but from the horrendous sorcery that had lit the morning sky-a devour-ing, profoundly hungry sorcery. Had that energy reached for him, he was not sure he could have withstood it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What in Hood’s name was that?’ Hedge demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll I know, it was old. And vicious.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We gonna get any more, you think?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuick Ben shrugged, ‘I hope not.’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reaper-s-gale-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-7/page-456.html","bookId":2013,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:37:33 PM"}
