Not in the hole, on the beach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChaos was going on above her. On top of her. A whole football team scrimmaging there. Thick snarls, gasping breath, then suddenly a yelp. Sand fountained around her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it all stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey lay still for a moment longer, then rolled over to look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom was half sitting, half crouching in the sand, his dark hair wildly mussed, his face scratched. He was breathing in gasps. In his hand was a Swiss Army knife, the blade not shining but dark. The wolf was gone. So was the hole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is it dead?\" Audrey panted. She could hear the hysteria in her own voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. It went into that crater thing. Then the crater disappeared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh,\" Audrey said. She looked at him, blinked. \"You know, we\u0027ve got to stop meeting like this.\" Then she collapsed back on the sand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Audrey! Audrey, where are you? Audrey!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey had seldom heard a voice filled with so much terror, but she was drifting in an endorphin cloud of overexertion. She could barely rouse herself to wave a hand without looking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re here!\" Tom shouted. \"Here!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next moment Jenny was on her knees beside them. \"Oh, God, what happened? Are you all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The wolf happened,\" Tom said. \"She\u0027s all right, it\u0027s just reaction.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right? Oh, Tom, you\u0027re bleeding!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSounds of hugging. Normally, Audrey would have let them have their reunion in peace, but now she said, \"Eric\u0027s back there. I don\u0027t know if he\u0027s all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll go see.\" Tom detached himself from Jenny\u0027s arms and went. Jenny turned to Audrey, golden dress shining in the gloom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It tried to chase me into a hole. A hole,\" she repeated, before Jenny could ask, and described the thing she\u0027d seen. \"I don\u0027t know why, but it wanted me to fall in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my God,\" Jenny whispered. \"Oh, God, Audrey, it\u0027s all my fault. And if Eric is dead-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not dead,\" Tom said, coming back up. \"He\u0027s breathing, and I can\u0027t even find any bleeding or anything. The wolf didn\u0027t want him; it wanted Audrey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was only then that Jenny asked, \"What are you doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom looked at the ocean. \"I didn\u0027t think anything would happen here-but I wasn\u0027t sure. I hung around in the hotel just in case. When I saw Audrey going down to the beach, I kept an eye on her from the deck up there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Tom,\" Jenny said again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank God you did,\" Audrey said, picking herself up. She was bruised, but everything seemed to be in working order. Her brand new Oscar de la Renta, though, was another matter. \"It\u0027s a pity you couldn\u0027t have saved the dress, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they climbed the sandy ocean ramp up to the hotel grounds, she said thoughtfully, \"Actually, I suppose you saved my life. It doesn\u0027t really matter about the dress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t be the ones to tell the police about Eric,\" Jenny said. \"Because we can\u0027t afford to lose the time, and because they might separate us. But we can\u0027t just leave him there, either.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a fine trembling in all her muscles, her reaction nearly as severe as Audrey\u0027s. Deep inside her, though, was a steel core of determination. She knew what had to be done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why can\u0027t we lose the time?\" Tom asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because we\u0027ve got to get the others,\" Jenny said \"We all need to go somewhere and talk.\" She saw Audrey, who was slowly making repairs to her hair and dress, give her a sharp glance. \"I\u0027ll explain later, for now just trust me, Tom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom\u0027s hazel eyes were dark, puzzled, but after a moment he nodded. \"Let me get cleaned up a little; to I\u0027ll go tell them at the front desk that there\u0027s somebody unconscious on the beach. Then we can go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he went, he took a note to send up to the ballroom, too. It was from Jenny to Brian, explaining that she had to leave the prom without him, and that she was sorry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny shut her eyes and leaned against the wall. Think, she told herself. Don\u0027t collapse yet, think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Audrey, we both need to call our parents. We\u0027ve got to tell them-something-some reason why we\u0027re not coming home tonight. And then we need to think of somewhere we can go. I wonder how much a hotel room costs?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey, with two bobby pins in her mouth, just looked at Jenny. She couldn\u0027t speak, but the look was enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re not doing anything dangerous,\" Jenny assured her. \"But we\u0027ve got to talk. And I think we\u0027ll only be safe when we\u0027re all together.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey removed the pins and licked her lips. \"What about Michael\u0027s apartment?\" she said. \"His dad\u0027s gone for the week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Audrey, you\u0027re brilliant. Now think of what we say to our parents, and we\u0027ll be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end they settled for the old double-bluff. Jenny called her house and told her mother she would be staying at Audrey\u0027s; Audrey called her house and told Gabrielle the housekeeper that she would be staying at Jenny\u0027s. Then they called Dee, who had her own phone, and had her come out to the hotel in her jeep, while Tom took the RX-7 to his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehouse to pick up Michael. Finally Tom went back out for Zach, while a cross and sleep-wrinkled Michael let the others into his apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was nearly one-thirty in the morning when they were all together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Caffeine,\" Michael mumbled. \"For God\u0027s sake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stunts your growth,\" said Dee. \"Makes you blind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why isn\u0027t there anything in this refrigerator except mayonnaise and Diet Coke?\" Audrey called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There should be some cream cheese in there somewhere,\" Michael said. \"And there\u0027s Cracks Jack in the cupboard; Dad bought a case at the Price Club. If you love me at all, bring me a Coke and tell me what\u0027s going on. I was asleep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I nearly got killed,\" Audrey said, coming around the corner in time to see his eyes widen \"Here.\" She distributed Diet Cokes and Cracker Jack to everyone except Dee, who just snorted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat a mismatched group we are, Jenny thought, looking around at them. Michael and Audrey were on the couch, Michael in the faded gray sweats he wore as pajamas, and Audrey in the ruins of ha saucy little black dress. Dee was on the other side of Audrey, dressed for action in biking shorts and a khaki tank top, long legs sprawled in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom, on the love seat, was windblown and handsome in jeans and a dark blue jersey. Zach sat on the floor by the table wearing a vaguely Oriental black outfit-maybe pajamas, maybe a jogging suit, Jenny thought. Jenny herself was perched on the arm of the love seat in her shimmering and totally inappropriate gold dress. She hadn\u0027t thought about changing, She could see Dee\u0027s eyes on the dress, but she couldn\u0027t return the amused glance. She was too wrought-up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Isn\u0027t somebody going to explain what\u0027s going on?\" Michael said, tearing into the Cracker Jack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Audrey can start,\" Jenny said, clasping her hands together and trying to keep them still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey quickly described what had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what\u0027s with this hole?\" Michael said when she finished. \"Pardon me for asking, but how come the wolf didn\u0027t just kill you? If it\u0027s the same one that attacked Gordie Wilson.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it\u0027s a Game,\" Jenny said. \"A new Game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee\u0027s piercing night-dark gaze was on her. \"You\u0027ve seen Julian,\" she said without hesitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny nodded, clenching her hands even more tightly together. Tom turned to look at her sharply, then turned away, his shoulders tense. Zach stared at her with an inscrutable expression, the black outfit accentuating his pallor. Michael whistled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey, her back very straight, said, \"Tell us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny told them. Not everything, but the essence of what had happened, leaving out the bits that nobody needed to know. Like the kissing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He said that he\u0027d give me a chance to get free of my promise,\" she finished. \"That he was going to play a new Game with us, and that we were all players. And at the end he said that the new Game was lambs and monsters.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey drew in her breath, frowning. \"Like that thing we saw those kids playing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What lambs and monsters?\" Michael demanded. \"I never heard of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s like cops and robbers,\" Jenny said. \"It starts like hide-and-seek-if you\u0027re the monster, you count while all the lambs hide. Then when you find a lamb, you chase it-and if you tag it, it\u0027s caught. Then you bring it back to your base and keep it as a prisoner until somebody else sneaks up to let it free.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or until all the lambs are caught and they get eaten,\" Audrey said darkly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cute game,\" said Zach, then relapsed into silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we\u0027re playing, we\u0027d better figure out the rules,\" Dee said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We may not have to play,\" Jenny said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all looked at her. She knew she was flushed. She had been thinking ever since she\u0027d looked over the balcony railing to see Audrey\u0027s tiny figure disappear into darkness, and by now she\u0027d worked herself into a rather odd state.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\" Dee said, lynx-eyed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny heard herself give a strange little overstrained laugh. \"Well, maybe I should just stop it right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was surprised by the volume of the protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Audrey cried. \"Give in to a guy-any guy? Absolutely not. Never.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have to fight him,\" Dee said, smacking a slender fist into her palm. \"You know that, Jenny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to fight him,\" Tom said grimly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh, look,\" Michael said, and then got Audrey\u0027s elbow in his ribs. \"I mean-you\u0027d better not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right, you\u0027d better not,\" Audrey said. \"And I\u0027m the one who got chased tonight, so I\u0027m the one who\u0027s got the right to say it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We won\u0027t let you,\" Dee said, both long legs on the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efloor now, leaning forward in the intensity of her emotion. \"It\u0027s our problem, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny could feel herself flushing more deeply as a wave of guilt swept her. They didn\u0027t understand-they didn\u0027t know that she\u0027d almost surrendered of her own free will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s evil,\" Tom was saying. \"You can\u0027t just give up and let evil win because of us. You can\u0027t, Jenny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach\u0027s dry voice cut through the impassioned atmosphere. \"I don\u0027t think,\" he said, \"that there\u0027s much point in arguing about it. Because from what Jenny said before, it sounded like she agreed to the new Game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did,\" Jenny said. \"I didn\u0027t know-when I agreed I thought he\u0027d leave the rest of you alone. I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d be involved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And he said the Game had started. Which means-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing she can do to change it now, even if she wanted to.\" Audrey finished Zach\u0027s sentence crisply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like I said\"-Dee gave her most bloodthirsty smile-\"I think we\u0027d better figure out the rules.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all looked at one another. Jenny saw the consensus in all their faces. They were all together now, even Tom. Like the old days. All for one and one for all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat down on the love seat beside Tom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what do we need to do to win?\" Audrey asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Avoid getting caught,\" Zach said tersely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael, rummaging glumly in his Cracker Jack, said, \"How? We can\u0027t stay here forever.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not as simple as that,\" Dee said. \"Look - there are different kinds of games, right? The first Game, the one in the paper house, was like a race game. In a race game the point is to get from the start to the goal in a certain amount of time-or before everybody else does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like Parcheesi,\" Jenny said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, like Chutes and Ladders!\" Michael said, looking up excitedly. \"Remember that? You throw the dice and go across the board-and sometimes you can go up a ladder, the way we went up the stairs in the paper house. And sometimes you fall down a chute-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"-which we did, on the third floor,\" Dee said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We had that game as kids,\" Zach said with a half glance at Jenny. \"Only ours was called Snakes and Ladders.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, the point is that lots of games are race games,\" Dee went on. She jumped up and began to pace the room. \"But then there are hunting games, too-those are actually the oldest games of all. Like hide-and-seek. That started out as practice for stalking wild animals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know?\" Michael said suspiciously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aba told me. And tag is like capturing domestic animals. This new game Julian is playing is a hunting and capturing game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom shrugged bleakly. \"So he\u0027s planning to hunt down and capture each of us animals.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trophies,\" Zach said in a low voice. \"Like my father\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not like your father\u0027s,\" Dee said, stopping to look at him. \"Your father\u0027s are dead. This is more like a game where you catch each of the animals and put them in a big pen to wait for the slaughter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael choked on his Coke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it\u0027s true,\" Dee said. \"He didn\u0027t say he was going to kill us one by one. He said he was going to capture us-until the free ones find his base.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWiping his mouth, Michael said hoarsely, \"Let\u0027s find it now and avoid the whole thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But that\u0027s the point,\" Dee said, sitting on the windowsill. \"How do we find it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How can we?\" Zach said. \"It\u0027s hopeless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTom was still looking into the distance. \"There might be another way,\" he began, and then stopped and shook his head. Jenny didn\u0027t like the expression on his face. She didn\u0027t like the way the green flecks in his eyes showed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tom ...\" she said, but Audrey was talking to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Didn\u0027t he tell you anything about it, Jenny? His base?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Jenny said. \"Only that it was somewhere to keep us before he takes us to the Shadow World.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which means it\u0027s not in the Shadow World itself,\" Dee said, and Michael muttered, \"Thank God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But wherever it is, you get there through the holes?\" Audrey said. \"Oh, wonderful. I\u0027ll pass, thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These holes, now,\" Michael said thoughtfully. \"I think they\u0027re very interesting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe because you have one for a brain,\" Audrey said with a snappishness she hadn\u0027t shown to Michael in weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael gave her a startled glance quite different from his standard wounded look. \"No, really,\" he said. \"You know, they make me think of something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0027s a story by Ambrose Bierce-the book\u0027s probably around here somewhere.\" He twisted his head toward the wall-to-wall bookcases that were the main feature of the living room. Michael\u0027s father wrote science fiction, and the apartment was filled with strange things. Models of spaceships, posters of obscure SF movies, weird masks-but mainly books. Books overflowing the shelves and lying in piles on the floor. As usual, Michael couldn\u0027t find the one he was looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, anyway,\" he said, \"Ambrose Bierce wrote this trilogy about weird disappearances, and there was this one story about a sixteen-year-old boy. His name was Charles Ashmore, and one night after it snowed he went out to the spring to get water. Well, the thing was, he went out the door and he never came back. Afterward, his family went outside to see what was the matter, and they saw his tracks in the snow-and the tracks went halfway to the spring and just stopped dead.\" Michael lowered his voice dramatically. \"Nobody ever saw him again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Great,\" Jenny said. \"But what has that got to dc with things?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, the story was supposed to be fiction, right? But there was another part in the book, where this German doctor-Dr. Hern, or something-had a theory about how people disappeared. He said that \u0027in the visible world there are void places\u0027-sort of like the holes in Swiss cheese.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that guy fell into one?\" Dee said, looking intrigued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fell-or was dragged. Like I said, the stories were supposed to be fiction. But what if there really are voids like that? And what if Julian can-well, control them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a nasty idea,\" Dee said. \"I like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you saying all people who disappear fall into the Shadow World?\" Audrey asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe not all of them, but maybe some of them. And maybe not all the way in, maybe just partway. In the story, when Charles Ashmore\u0027s mother went by the place where he disappeared the next day, she could hear his voice. She heard it fainter and fainter every day, until it finally just faded completely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A halfway place,\" Jenny whispered. \"Like the More Games store-some place halfway between the Shadow World and here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee was looking at her shrewdly. \"Like Julian\u0027s base, huh? Somewhere to keep us until he takes us to the Shadow World.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you hear about vortex things in Stonehenge and Sedona, Arizona,\" Michael said. \"Was it like a vortex, Audrey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was big and black,\" Audrey said shortly. \"I don\u0027t know how much more vortexy you can get.\" But she gave Michael the prize from her Cracker Jack, a blue plastic magnifying glass. He put it beside his prize, a mini baseball card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny was playing absently at her own prize package, not really seeing it. \"But it doesn\u0027t help us find the base,\" she said. \"Unless we jump into one of those voids, and then I don\u0027t think we\u0027re coming back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It closed up completely,\" Tom said. \"After the wolf jumped into it, it just disappeared. I don\u0027t even think I could find the place again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Anyway, I\u0027ll bet he can move them around,\" Michael was beginning, when Jenny gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had torn open her prize package. She\u0027d been fiddling with the prize, completely preoccupied with the question of voids-until something caught her eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Dee said, jumping up from the windowsill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a book of poetry-or something.\" It was a very small book, on cheap paper with large print. One sentence per page. But it was a very strange poem for a Cracker Jack prize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny read:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the midst of the word she was trying to say, In the midst of her laughter and glee, She had softly and suddenly vanished away-For the Snark was a Boojum, you see.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was dead silence in the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It could be a coincidence,\" Zach said slowly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael was shaking his rumpled head. \"But those lines are wrong. That\u0027s not the way they go-look, that book I know I\u0027ve got.\" He went into his bedroom and came out with Alice in Wonderland and Other Favorites. \"They\u0027re from a poem about these guys who go out hunting imaginary animals-Snarks. Only some of the Snarks are Boojums, and those hunt you. And in the end one of them finds a Snark, and it turns out to be a Boojum. But it\u0027s he a the poem-\u0027In the midst of the word he was trying to say, In the midst of his laughter and glee ...\u0027 You see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cracker Jack wouldn\u0027t make a mistake like that,\" Tom said, with a wry smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Jenny whispered. \"It\u0027s from Julian. But is it about what almost happened tonight-or about something that\u0027s going to happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silence stretched. Tom\u0027s brows were drawn together. Dee had her jaguar look on and was pacing again, Zachary\u0027s gray eyes were narrow, his lean body tense and still.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael had put down the book. \"You think he\u0027s giving us clues in advance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would be-sporting, I guess,\" Jenny said. \"And he gave me a kind of clue on the balcony, remember. He said he\u0027d go after \u0027Little Red Riding-Hood\u0027 first.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone looked at everyone else speculatively. Suddenly Dee whirled and did a swift, flowing punch-and-kick. \"Then we might just have a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcitement was passing from one of them to another like sparks traveling down a fuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we can figure the clues out beforehand-and Unjust surround the person they\u0027re about...\"Dee said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know we can! I always wanted to be Sherlock Holmes,\" said Michael.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it might actually work,\" Tom said. A new light had kindled in his hazel eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDee laughed exultantly. \"Of course it will work! We\u0027re going to beat him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny was caught up in the fervor herself. Maybe they could outthink Julian. \"It\u0027s not going to be easy-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But we\u0027ll do it,\" Audrey said. \"Because we have to.\" She gave Jenny a spiky-lashed glance and picked up several empty Coke cans to take to the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d better start with the one we have, then,\" Zach said, turning a cool, analytical gaze on Jenny\u0027s riddle book.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless that one\u0027s already finished,\" Michael said. \"I mean, if it was about Audrey-or should I call you Little Red Riding-Hood?\" he shouted to the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Call me madam,\" Audrey said from around the corner, her good humor clearly restored. \"Call me Al.\" She began to sing a Paul Simon song.\" \u0027I can call you Betty, and Betty, when you call me, you can call me-\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well?\" Michael yelled when she didn\u0027t finish. \"What can I call you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAudrey didn\u0027t answer, and Michael snorted, \"Women!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZach was saying, \"Yeah, but what if it\u0027s a new clue? It says she, so it\u0027s got to be either-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJenny heard him as if from a distance. She was listening, listening, and all at once she couldn\u0027t breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Audrey?\" she said. The sound of rattling cans in the kitchen had stopped. \"Audrey? Audrey?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone was looking at her, frightened by something in her voice. The sound of raw panic, Jenny guessed. Jenny stared back at them, and their images seemed to waver. Utter silence came from the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she was on her feet and moving. She reached the comer before any of them, even Dee. She looked into the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer screams rang off the light fixture in the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No! No! Oh, God, no!\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-forbidden-game-the-chase-the-forbidden-game-2/page-10.html","bookId":2435,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:10:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:10:26 PM"}
