JACK HOLDEN ON THE INDIAN QUESTION.","content":"\u0026nbsp;It is a terrible thing to see a man stretched out in death who but a minute before stood full of life and strength. Herbert gazed at the dead Indian with a strange sensation of pity and relief, and could hardly realize that, but for his interposition, it would have been the hunter, not the Indian, who would have lost his life. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The hunter was more used to such scenes, and his calmness was unruffled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That\u0027s the end of the dog!” he said, touching with his foot the dead body.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What made him want to kill you?” asked Herbert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Revenge,” answered Holden.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “For what? Had you injured him?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That\u0027s the way he looked at it. One day I caught the varmint stealin\u0027 my best hoss. He\u0027d have got away with him, too, if I hadn\u0027t come home just as I did. I might have shot him—most men would—but I hate to take a man\u0027s life for stealin\u0027; and I took another way. My whip was lyin\u0027 handy, and I took it and lashed the rascal over his bare back a dozen times, and then told him to dust, or I\u0027d serve him worse. He left, but there was an ugly look in his eyes, and I knew well enough he\u0027d try to get even.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How long ago was this?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Most a year. It\u0027s a long time, but an Indian never forgets an injury or an insult, and I knew that he was only bidin\u0027 his time. So I always went armed, and kept a good lookout. It was only this mornin\u0027 that he caught me at a disadvantage. I\u0027d been taking a walk, and left my gun at home. He was prowlin\u0027 round, and soon saw how things stood. He\u0027d have killed me sure, if you hadn\u0027t come in the nick of time.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I am glad I was near,” said Herbert, “but it seems to me a terrible thing to shoot a man. I\u0027m glad it wasn\u0027t I that killed him.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Mebbe it was better for me, as he was my enemy,” said Jack Holden. “It won\u0027t trouble my conscience a mite. I don\u0027t look upon an Indian as a man.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why not?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He\u0027s a snake in the grass—a poisonous serpent, that\u0027s what I call him,” said Jack Holden.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Herbert shook his head. He couldn\u0027t assent to this.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You feel different, no doubt. You\u0027re a tenderfoot. You ain\u0027t used to the ways of these reptiles. You haven\u0027t seen what I have,” answered Holden.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What have you seen?” asked Herbert, judging correctly that Holden referred to some special experience.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I\u0027ll tell you. You see, I\u0027m an old settler in this Western country. I\u0027ve traveled pretty much all over the region beyond the Rockies, and I\u0027ve seen a good deal of the red men. I know their ways as well as any man. Well, I was trampin\u0027 once in Montany, when, one afternoon, I and my pard—he was prospectin\u0027—came to a clearin\u0027, and there we saw a sight that made us all feel sick. It was the smokin\u0027 ruins of a log cabin, which them devils had set on fire. But that wasn\u0027t what I referred to. Alongside there lay six dead bodies—the man, his wife, two boys, somewhere near your age, a little girl, of maybe ten, and a baby—all butchered by them savages, layin\u0027—in the hunter\u0027s vernacular—in their gore. It was easy to see how they\u0027d killed the baby, by his broken skull. They had seized the poor thing by the feet, and swung him against the side of the house, dashin\u0027 out his brains.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Herbert shuddered, and felt sick, as the picture of the ruined home and the wretched family rose before his imagination.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “It was Indians that did it, of course,” proceeded Holden. “They\u0027re born savage, and such things come natural to them.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Are there no good Indians?” asked the boy.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “There may be,” answered Jack Holden, doubtfully, “though I haven\u0027t seen many. They\u0027re as scarce as plums in a boardin\u0027 house puddin\u0027, I reckon.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I present this as Jack Holden\u0027s view, not mine. He had the prejudices of the frontier, and frontiersmen are severe judges of their Indian neighbors. They usually look at but one side of the picture, and are not apt to take into consideration the wrongs which the Indians have undeniably received. There is another extreme, however, and the sentimentalists who deplore Indian wrongs, and represent them as a brave, suffering and oppressed people, are quite as far away from a just view of the Indian question.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What\u0027s your name, youngster?” asked Holden, with the curiosity natural under the circumstances.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Herbert Carr.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Do you live nigh here?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Herbert indicated, as well as he could, the location of his home.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I know—you live with Mr. Falkland. Are you his son?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No; Mr. Falkland has gone away.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You\u0027re not living there alone, be you?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No; I came out here with a young man—Mr. Melville. He bought the cottage of Mr. Falkland, who was obliged to go East.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “You don\u0027t say so. Why, we\u0027re neighbors. I live three miles from here.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Did you know Mr. Falkland?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes; we used to see each other now and then. He was a good fellow, but mighty queer. What\u0027s the use of settin\u0027 down and paintin\u0027 pictures? What\u0027s the good of it all?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Don\u0027t you admire pictures, Mr. Holden?” asked Herbert.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “That\u0027s that you called me? I didn\u0027t quite catch on to it.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Mr. Holden. Isn\u0027t that your name?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Don\u0027t call me mister. I\u0027m plain Jack Holden. Call me Jack.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I will if you prefer it,” said Herbert, dubiously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Of course I do. We don\u0027t go much on style in the woods. Won\u0027t you come home with me, and take a look at my cabin? I ain\u0027t used to company, but we can sit down and have a social smoke together, and then I\u0027ll manage to find something to eat.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you, Mr. Holden—I mean, Jack—but I must be getting home; Mr. Melville will be feeling anxious, for, as it is, I shall be late.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Is Mr. Melville, as you call him, any way kin to you?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No; he is my friend and employer.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Young man?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Yes; he is about twenty-five.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How long have you two been out here?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Not much over a week.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why isn\u0027t Melville with you this morning?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “He is in delicate health—consumption—and he gets tired sooner than I do.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I must come over and see you, I reckon.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I hope you will. We get lonely sometimes. If you would like to borrow something to read, Mr. Melville has plenty of books.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Read!” repeated Jack. “No, thank you. I don\u0027t care much for books. A newspaper, now, is different. A man likes to know what\u0027s going on in the world; but I leave books to ministers, schoolmasters, and the like.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “If you don\u0027t read, how do you fill up your time, Jack?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “My pipe\u0027s better than any book, lad. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to set down and have a smoke now. Wish I had an extra pipe for you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thank you,” said Herbert, politely, “but I don\u0027t smoke.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Don\u0027t smoke! How old are you?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Sixteen.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Sixteen years old, and don\u0027t smoke! Why, where was you raised?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “In the East,” answered Herbert, smiling.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why, I smoked before I was three foot high, I was goin\u0027 to say. I couldn\u0027t get along without smokin\u0027.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Nor I without reading.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Well, folks will have their different tastes, I allow. I reckon I\u0027ll be goin\u0027 back.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Shan\u0027t you bury him?” asked Herbert, with a glance at the dead Indian.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “No; he wouldn\u0027t have buried me.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “But you won\u0027t leave him here? If you\u0027ll bury him, I\u0027ll help you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Not now, boy. Since you make a point of it, I\u0027ll come round to-morrow, and dig a hole to put him in. I\u0027ll take the liberty of carryin\u0027 home his shootin\u0027 iron. He won\u0027t need it where he\u0027s gone.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The two parted in a friendly manner, and Herbert turned his face homeward, grave and thoughtful.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2962/81535.html","bookId":427,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 4:04:03 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 4:04:03 AM"}
