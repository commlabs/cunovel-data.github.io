{"id":21343,"no":92,"title":"Chapter 24","content":"Reuben scarcely knew what brought him to Cheat Land. It was about a week after the blow fell that he found himself treading the once familiar lane, lifting the latch of the garden gate, and knocking at the green house-door. Nothing had changed, except to fade a little and show some signs of wear and tear. Alice herself had not changed, nor had she faded, though her cheeks might have fallen in a trifle and a few lines traced themselves round her mouth.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Welcome,\" she said, and laughed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He took her hand, and forgot to be angry because she had laughed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Come in, and we\u0027ll have a talk. Father\u0027s out, and mother\u0027s upstairs.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She led the way into the queer little kitchen, which was also unchanged except for the fading of the curtains,[Pg 323] and the introduction of one or two new books on the shelves. Alice pulled forward his old chair, and sat down opposite him on the settle. She wore one of her long wrapper-pinafores, this time of a warm clay-colour, which seemed to put a glow into her cheeks.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, Alice,\" he said huskily.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, Reuben, I\u0027m glad to see you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027ve heard?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She nodded. Then she said gently:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Poor Rose.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Reuben flushed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"One o\u0027 my victims, eh?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, I knew you\u0027d rather I said that than \u0027poor Reuben.\u0027\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Reckon I would. I remember as how you wur always trying to make out as my lazy good-fur-naun sons wur my victims, and as how I\u0027d sacrificed them all to my farm; now I reckon you\u0027re trying to do the same wud Rose.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Where is she?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I dunno. Somewheres between here and Canada. May she rot there lik a sheep on its back, and her man too. Now say \u0027poor Rose.\u0027\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He turned on her almost fiercely, his lips curled back from his teeth in a sneer.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If you speak like that I\u0027ll say \u0027poor Reuben.\u0027\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, say it—you w?an\u0027t be far wrong. Wot sort o\u0027 chap am I to have pride? My farm\u0027s ruined, my wife\u0027s run away, my children have left me—wot right have I to be proud?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Because, though all those things have happened, you\u0027re holding your head up still.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But I ?un\u0027t—yesterday I wur fair crying and sobbing in front of all the children. In the kitchen, it wur—after supper—I put down my head on the table, and——\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e [Pg 324]\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hush, I don\u0027t want to hear any more. I can guess what you must have suffered. I expect you miss Rose.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I do—justabout.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"So should I in your place.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She wur a beautiful woman, Alice.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Alice nodded.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, and her liddle dentical ways!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Alice nodded again.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You d?an\u0027t mind me talking to you of her?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No, of course not.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She wur the beautifullest I\u0027ve known, and gay, and sweet, and a woman to love. But she deceived me. I married her expecting money, and there wur none—I married her fur her body, and she\u0027s given it to another.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, you\u0027re not a hypocrite, anyway. You don\u0027t pretend you married her for any but the lowest motives.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Wot should I have married her fur, then?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Some people marry for love.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Love I—no. I\u0027ve loved but one woman.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Me!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e They had both said more than they intended, and suddenly realised it. Though the self-betrayal meant most to Alice, she was the first to recover a steady voice.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But that does not matter now,\" she said calmly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He leaned suddenly forward and took her hand.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Alice.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Her hand lay in his, a very small thing, and her head bent towards it. She did not want him to see her cheeks flush and her eyes fill at this his first caress.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Alice—how did you know?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027m not a fool.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I guessed too.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Of course you did. I—I gave myself away. I pleaded with you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He raised her hand slowly to his lips.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I forgot you all the time I wur wud Rose,\" he remarked naively.\n\u003cbr\u003e \u0026nbsp;\n\u003cbr\u003e \"You needn\u0027t tell me that.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But now I—well, it\u0027s too late anyhow. I\u0027m a married man, no matter that my wife\u0027s in Canada. Of course, I could git a divorce—but I w?an\u0027t.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No—it would cost money.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"More than I could spare.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Alice laughed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I never looked upon Rose as my rival—I always knew my real rival was your farm, and though now Rose is out of the way, that still stands between us.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Reuben was silent. He sat leaning forward in his chair, holding Alice\u0027s hand. Then he abruptly rose to his feet.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, I must be going. It\u0027s done me good, our talk. Not that you\u0027ve said anything particular comforting, but then you never did. It\u0027s good anyway to sit wud a woman wot\u0027s not lik a fat stroked cat—not a thin kicked one, nuther,\" he added viciously, remembering Caro. \"You\u0027re lik a liddle tit-bird, Alice. I love you. But I\u0027m not sorry I didn\u0027t marry you, for you\u0027d have busted me same as Rose, only in a different way.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Most likely.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She laughed again. He stooped forward and kissed her forehead, and the laugh died on her lips.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2094/59464.html","bookId":524,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 1:00:29 PM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 1:00:29 PM"}
