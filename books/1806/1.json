Shea\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 1\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How much?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If we cut it at your shoulders…two silver marks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinderella winced. It wasn’t enough. “What if you take it all?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe barber jerked his eyes from Cinderella’s brilliant hair and gaped at her. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How much will you give me if you take all my hair?” Cinderella asked, pushing an elbow-length lock of hair over her shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mademoiselle, you couldn’t want to—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How much?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wigmaker studied her hair again. “The extra length will mean a finer style for the wig. Five silver marks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinderella bit her lip. He was overpaying her. Her scarlet-red hair was unusual, and her hair was thick and luxurious, but even with those qualities, the best she could hope for was four silver marks and a handful of copper coins. But the chateau roof needed patching, and Cinderella could not afford to turn down such generosity. “Done,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wigmaker wiped his scissors on a clean cloth. “You have fine hair, Mademoiselle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinderella gripped the arms of the wooden chair until they creaked when the man sheered the first lock from her head. “Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinderella left several minutes later, her pockets heavier and her head lighter. Folk gave her odd looks as they darted past her on the street, staring at her shamefully short hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer magnificent strawberry-colored mane was sheered in a pixie cut. She still had a red fringe of bangs that flopped into her eyes, but the rest of her hair was almost peasant-boy-short.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hairstyle would bring looks of disapproval until it grew out, but Cinderella didn’t care. She needed the money. Aveyron needed the money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinderella squared her shoulders and glanced at the sky. The sun was a thin disk, almost entirely blocked by the capital’s walls. “Home it is then,” Cinderella said, turning her feet towards her lands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the dolphin plaza, she ran into a squadron of Erlauf soldiers in their gray and burgundy uniforms. Their armor reminded Cinderella of dragon scales the way it overlapped and hinged together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lieutenant leading the squadron watched Cinderella as she walked past them, but he watched just about every Trieux city resident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree years ago, Erlauf invaded Trieux—Cinderella’s country—in a brutally short war and claimed it as Erlauf territory. Erlauf had taken Trieux with little pain, but dislike still brewed between citizens. There hadn’t been any violence since the takeover, but there was plenty of hate to go around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Trieux’s soldiers mostly killed or imported deep into the heart of Erlauf, the citizens of Trieux had no way to resist. The sheer number of soldiers present in the city was outrageously large considering the lack of rebellion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Erlauf was ruled by the cautious Queen Freja and her equally cautious consort, and both of them intended to keep Trieux in their clutches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinderella left the capital—the Erlauf monarchs had renamed it Werra, obliterating its original Trieux name, Arroux—and followed a dirt road through the rolling farmland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sky was a canvas of colors when Cinderella reached her home, Aveyron Chateau. She slapped dust from her cloak and ventured into the boundaries of her buildings. She waved to one of the stable boys bringing a pair of draft horses into the stable for the night and paused to count the chickens before entering the chateau.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGilbert, the land steward, and his daughter Jeanne, the housekeeper, were talking in the kitchen. When Cinderella entered the warm room, they fell silent. This was not unusual. In spite of her ventures, the father and daughter remained stubbornly formal with her, but the gaping looks of horror they gave her were unusual. They hadn’t been this appalled since Cinderella donned servant clothes as her everyday dress months ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mademoiselle,” Gilbert said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeanne covered her mouth to stifle her gasp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your, your hair—b-but—why?” Gilbert said, laying a hand on a table to balance himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCinderella jingled her pocket, making the coins in it bounce. “Send for a carpenter tomorrow, please. We can afford to see that hole in the south wing ceiling patched,” Cinderella said, removing her cloak and hanging it near the fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mademoiselle,” Gilbert said in a pained voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It needed to be done, Gilbert,” Cinderella said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Mademoiselle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have my step-mother and step-sisters already had dinner?” Cinderella asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes,” Gilbert said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pheasant in a cream sauce, baked potatoes, and apple sauce,” Jeanne said, finding her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Any complaints?” Cinderella asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeanne shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good,” Cinderella said, taking a cooled baked potato and biting into it like an apple. The potato crumbled in Cinderella’s mouth and tasted creamy. “I like this potato. What kind is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Winter Red, mademoiselle,” Gilbert said. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cinderella-and-the-colonel-timeless-fairy-tales-3/page-1.html","bookId":1806,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:18 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:50:18 PM"}
