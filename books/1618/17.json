He opened his mouth slowly, leaning forward, and Felicity flashed to a thousand different fantasies. Of him leaning toward her, just like that, to taste her. Taking her hand in his, opening his mouth just that way, to kiss her palm. Her neck. Her, all over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wrapped his lips around the fork. She watched them, those fine, perfect lips, slowly taking the food into his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sensation of wet heat widening her, opening her, suffused Felicity. She tensed her thighs, suddenly aware of a maddening need she had to satisfy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes pierced her with their intensity. What would he be thinking? She faltered, began to pull her hand back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWill touched her wrist, gently took the fork from her fingers. His touch burned her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cleared his throat. “That was a turnip. But you’re doing it all wrong.” His voice was husky, ragged. “The neeps are best”—he carefully dug in his bowl, snagging careful proportions of stew—“when you get just enough with the onions”—he brought the fork to her lips—“and the meat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened her mouth and tasted. “Oh, yes,” she groaned, and saw his body gird at the sound she made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted her. She saw it in his eyes, there in the lamplight, feeding her carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More,” she urged him. She would show him how much he wanted her, how it was okay to want her. Just the thought of it had her body throbbing. “Feed me more.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHesitating, he fed her one more bite, then grew silent. The air was electric, as if they’d crossed some invisible threshold from which there was no return.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRollo was quiet as he finished his meal and Felicity saw his eyes flick to the door. “No way, Viking.” She’d seen the sex in his eyes. They flashed back to hers, surprised. “No retreat yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I . . .” he faltered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted her, and so he also wanted to flee. Will’s eyes shot to the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUh-oh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe straightened, his hands shifting to his thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was getting ready to leave. She wouldn’t let him. Here goes nothing. “You’re not going yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFelicity rose, slinked to his side of the table, and settled onto Will’s lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you . . .” Rollo’s body didn’t just still, it seized, every muscle hardening to stone. His hands gripped the edges of his chair, as if bracing for impact. “What are you doing?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want that cake,” she said, her sultry tone suggesting a whole lot more than cherry cake. Felicity leaned forward to cut a slice, using the opportunity to nestle her rump more snugly in his lap. She knew she’d shocked him, and there was no going back now. Because she would kiss her Viking before the night was out. “There’s nothing wrong with a little cake, is there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes ran down the length of her, concealed in slightly soiled pink silk. They landed on her feet, peeking pale and delicate from beneath her hem, and he thought he wasn’t so sure there was nothing wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis felt so good, there had to be something wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m sorry,” she said, mistaking his silence. She waggled her feet, and her shifting weight atop his thighs was pure torture. “I hope it’s okay. My bare feet I mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe realized he’d never in his life seen a woman’s naked foot before Felicity’s. His mouth went dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I can’t bear to wear those tight little slippers. I never wear shoes inside.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRollo couldn’t move. He thought he might have actually tried, but he couldn’t budge. It was a wonder he was able to breathe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I totally need a pedi.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A . . . ?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A pedicure.” She raised a leg, wiggling her toes. Her dress shifted a few inches up her calf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no idea what she was chattering about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn’t imagine a more perfect foot. Surely there didn’t exist toes more perfect, more adorable, than these.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe inched his hands to the sides of his thighs. He was so close to stroking her legs. He imagined sweeping his palms down to touch that sweet, pale foot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look at me, Will,” she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere—she’d spoken his name again. Her voice was cloaked in sweetness and innocence, and it set his body on fire. She gave him a little smile and parted her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe whispered to him, was whispering such sweet things, he thought perhaps he’d died and transcended to some glorious heaven, a place of his dreams peopled only with this exquisite, lone angel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you think I’m kissable, Will?” She gently took one of his hands, studied it, then held it in hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod help me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis whole body quickened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid he think she was kissable? God help him, did he ever. He’d been fantasizing about it from the very first. Kissing her, touching her, nuzzling her . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRavaging her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he’d not thought it could ever happen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because,” she said in the barest whisper, “I think I’d really like to kiss you now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 10\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned in. There it was again, that shimmer of gold in his eyes. They were hooded. Dark and hungry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh yeah. He wanted her. She could see it. Her whole body thrummed, felt poised for some great change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved. She panicked for a moment, thinking that he might try to leave. But then she saw he was merely shifting. Taking his hand from the side of his leg, bringing it to rest lightly around the back of her neck. His fingers wove under her hair, found her skin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ve got it in you, don’t you, Will Rollo?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer skin beaded tight at once, her whole body ready for him, rallying to his touch. The feel of his skin against hers was heady. It was a simple connection, yet it roused some deep-down craving, stirring her to a fever pitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh wow . . . What else could those fingers do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please, Will,” she whispered. She needed more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe threaded his fingers through her hair, stroked them back out, and Felicity luxuriated in his touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor so many weeks, they’d been in such close proximity, and yet miles apart. But now, this. Her heart hammered in her chest. More, she thought. She wanted more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe still held his other hand in hers. She studied it. It was large and strong, with a thick ridge of callus from decades of gripping his cane. Felicity traced the lines on his hand, lightly ran her fingertips over the thickened skin at the top of his palm. How would that hand feel chafing over her nakedness, those powerful fingers gripping her flesh?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sudden stab of desire made her flinch, and she gripped his hand, brought it to her chest. Just close enough to feel the uppermost swell of her breast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I . . . ” His voice cracked. He took his hand from her and clenched it, rubbing his fingers together as if to savor the memory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Och,” he rasped, shaking his head. Reaching a fingertip to her face, he gently traced the slope of her cheek. “You’re too lovely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please . . .” Please, please kiss me, touch me, grab me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re too . . .” He leaned closer, his eyes devouring her every feature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, Will, oh please, now . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Och, God help me,” he uttered, his voice hoarse with need. Darkness clouded his features, and she glimpsed a lust so keen and so powerful Felicity felt it would submerge her, sweep her away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned closer still. Her body hummed, desperate for him. His perfect, perfect lips parted. She felt his breath on her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Kiss me.” Her voice was the barest whisper even to her own ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe licked his lower lip, and sparks crackled low in her belly. Too much, he was too much, too unbearably, unwittingly sexy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJoy filled her, expanded her. She was about to kiss her Vik—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mum?” There was a sharp rap at the door. “I’ve the hot water you requested, mum.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA pained sound escaped her throat. Dammit. Damn damn dammit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mum?” There was another knock, louder now. “Are you all right there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I . . .” Felicity cleared her throat. She pulled back, holding Will’s gaze for a heartbeat. He was raw. Vulnerable, despairing. And then his eyelids slid closed, shuttering himself to her once again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m fine,” she called testily. With one last look at him, she rose from his lap. “Coming.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree maids bustled in, but Rollo couldn’t focus. He wasn’t certain if they’d just saved him, or doomed him to an eternity of anguished need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis world swam red. He was steeped in desire. His blood boiled with it. His body, wild and hard, his every nerve, mad with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe’d spent a lifetime with every impulse of his flesh utterly, deliberately, painfully suppressed. But a thin fissure had begun to crack along that façade, and it was as if he could hear the hounds of hell baying on the other side. The needs of a man, his needs, demanding satisfaction, demanding relief, in a cacophony of raging desire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDark lusts, primal urges, secret desires, all focused on Felicity. Only Felicity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Apologies, mum. With all the food preparations, your bath slipped my mind.” Rollo heard the women shuffling around, felt their curious gazes on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was the sound of a metal washbasin clanging onto wood. “ ’Tis so late, I hope you don’t mind, t’won’t be a full bathing. Just a wee splash. Though we can arrange a nice hip bath tomorrow, to be certain.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned forward. Gathered his feet under him. Took and clutched at the head of his cane. Somehow pulled himself to standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Will, wait.” Her voice was furtive, urgent at his back. But he could only shuffle forward to the door. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lord-of-the-highlands-highlands-4/page-17.html","bookId":1618,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:08:11 PM"}
