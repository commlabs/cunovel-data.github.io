Now you say you need some roofin\u0027 nails?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly had grown into a handsome young man in the seven years since he\u0027d visited his grandmother and sweated himself into a stupor in her smokehouse. Still, there was a wariness in his eyes, a careful shell to protect himself against the whispers he overheard in the halls of Fayette County High. They could talk about him all they liked; he didn\u0027t care, but once he heard his mother\u0027s or grandmother\u0027s name mentioned, he turned upon the offender with a vengeance. He wasn\u0027t mean, though, and was unprepared for the mean tricks used in after-school fights by country boys who were growing up to be the spitting images of their fathers; crotch kicks and eye gouges were common, and many times Billy had found himself ringed by gleefully shouting kids while his face banged into somebody\u0027s kneecap. There was no one he could really call a close friend, though he dreamed of being popular and going out on Saturday nights to Fayette with the gregarious bunch of kids who seemed to get along so well with just about everybody. It had taken him a long time to accept the fact that people were afraid of him; he saw it in their eyes when he walked into a room, heard it when conversations were cut off in his presence. He was different - it was difference enough that he was dark-skinned and obviously of Indian heritage - and since entering Fayette County High he\u0027d been effectively isolated. His crust of caution went deep, protecting his self-respect and his still-childlike sense of wonder at the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe read a lot - damaged hardbacks and paperback novels he sometimes found at garage sales. He\u0027d come across a real find several weeks ago: a boxful of old National Geographies brought up from someone\u0027s basement, where they\u0027d been moldering for a while. His treks - through forests, following the disused railroad tracks and old logging roads - were taking him farther and farther away from home; often, when the weather wasn\u0027t too chilly, he\u0027d take a bedroll out into the woods and spend the night, content with his own company and listening to the forest noises that punctuated the darkness. Out in the velvet black you could see shooting stars by the hundreds, and sometimes the faint blinking lights of an airplane headed for Birmingham. In the daytime he enjoyed the sun on his face, and could track deer like an expert, sometimes coming up within twenty feet or so of them before they sensed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis curiosity always burned within him to take one more step, to just round the next curve or top the next ridge; the world was beckoning him away from Hawthorne, away from the house where his quiet mother and his grim-lipped father waited for him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here you go,\" Granger said, and laid the packs of nails on the counter along with the other items - bread, bacon, sugar, milk, and flour - that Billy had come for. John owed Granger a good deal of money, and sent Billy in for groceries these days; Granger knew the Creekmores were just getting by on the skin of their teeth, and that those roofing nails would be used to try to hold that shack they called a house together for one more hot summer The last time that Granger had demanded his money, at the end of winter, Billy had worked for him in the afternoons for free, delivering groceries; now Billy was working out John Creekmore\u0027s gasoline and oil tab at the filling station. \"Want me to put this on your credit?\" he asked the boy, trying to keep a hard edge out of his voice; though he honestly liked Billy, his feelings for John Creekmore\u0027s credit were showing through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No sir,\" Billy said, and took out a few dollars from his jeans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well! John go to market early this year?\" He started adding up figures on a notepad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mom sold some of her pieces to a dealer in Fayette. I don\u0027t think this is enough to take care of what we owe you, but . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranger took the money and shrugged. \"It\u0027s all right. I\u0027ll still be here.\" He made change and handed back the few coins. \"Too bad John didn\u0027t get that job at the sawmill, huh? They pay pretty good up there, I understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes sir, but they only hired five new men, and Dad says over fifty showed up to get work.\" Billy started sacking the groceries. \"I guess a lot of folks need the money pretty bad, what with the droughts we\u0027ve been having.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Coy agreed. He couldn\u0027t think of any family offhand who needed money any worse than the Creekmores. Perhaps the only business that was really thriving in Hawthorne was the Chatham brothers\u0027 sawmill; they had owned the family mill for over forty years, still housed in the same run-down wooden structure with most of the same engines and belts running the saws. \"Well, maybe they\u0027ll be hirin\u0027 more in the fall. Have you given any thought to your own future?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly shrugged. Mr Dawson, who taught auto mechanics at Fayette County, had told him he was pretty quick at catching on to how machines worked and would probably make a good wrench-jockey after high school; the boy\u0027s adviser, Mr Marbury, had said his grades were very high in English and reading comprehension, but not quite high enough to get him a junior-college scholarship. \"I don\u0027t know. I guess I\u0027ll help out my dad for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoy grunted. The Creekmore land hadn\u0027t produced a good crop in three years. \"You ought to get into the construction business, Billy. I hear some of the contractors up around Fayette are going to be hirin\u0027 laborers. That\u0027s good pay, too. You know, I think Hawthorne\u0027s a losin\u0027 proposition for a bright young man like you. I wouldn\u0027t say that to just anybody, but there\u0027s a real spark in you. You think, you reason things out. Nope. Hawthorne\u0027s not for you, Billy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My folks need me.\" He grinned. \"I\u0027m the only one who can keep the Olds running.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, that\u0027s no kind of a future.\" The bell over the front door clanged, and Billy looked up as Mrs. Pettus and Melissa - her radiant blue-eyed face framed by a bell of hair the color of pale summer straw - came into the grocery store. Billy forgot to breathe for an instant; he saw her every day at Fayette County High, but still there was a quiver of electric tension down in his stomach. The school dance - May Night - was less than two weeks away, and Billy had been trying to muster the courage to ask her before anyone else did, but whenever he thought he was about to approach her he\u0027d remember that he had no money or driver\u0027s license, and that his clothes had been worn by someone else before him. Melissa always wore bright dresses, her face scrubbed and shining. Billy picked up his sacked groceries, wanting to get out before Melissa saw his grease-stained hands and shirt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My, my!\" Coy said. \"Don\u0027t you two look lovely this afternoon!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what ladies do best!\" Mrs. Pettus said merrily. She put a protective arm around her daughter as the Creekmore boy stepped past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi,\" Billy blurted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMelissa smiled and nodded her head, and then her mother pulled her on into the store.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched her over his shoulder as he neared the door, and saw her look quickly back at him. His heart pounded. And then the cowbell clanged over his head and he ran into someone who was coming through the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whoa there, Billy!\" Link Patterson said, trying to sidestep. \"You gatherin\u0027 wool, boy?\" He grinned good-naturedly; in another instant the grin had frozen on his face, because Billy Creekmore was staring at him as if he\u0027d sprouted horns from the top of his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly\u0027s blood had gone cold. Link Patterson looked healthy and well fed, possibly because he was one of the few men who\u0027d gotten a job at the sawmill and his life had taken a turn for the better; his wife was expecting their second child in October, and he\u0027d just made the first payment on a trailer parked outside the town limits. But Billy saw him enveloped in a purplish black haze of light, a hideous cocoon that slowly writhed around him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLink laughed nervously. \"What\u0027s wrong? Looks like you\u0027d seen a . . .\" The word ghost lay in his mouth like cold lead, and he swallowed it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly slowly reached out; his fingers touched the haze, but felt nothing. Link shrank back a step. \"Boy? What the hell\u0027s wrong with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoy Granger, Mrs. Pettus, and Melissa were watching. Billy blinked and shook his head. \"Nothing, Mr Patterson. Sorry. I . . . sorry.\" And then he was out the door and gone, hurrying along the road with the sack of groceries clamped in the crook of an arm. With a few more steps he began running, feeling scared and sick. What did I see? he asked himself, and didn\u0027t stop running even when he passed the green, grown-over ruin of the Booker house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pack of Kents, Coy,\" Link Patterson said. As Granger got his cigarettes, Link stepped to the window and peered out, watching Billy running away. He could hear the high singsong of the saws; in fifteen minutes he\u0027d be on the line, called in to fill the shift for a man who\u0027d gotten sick and had to go home. \"That Creekmore boy is . . . really strange, ain\u0027t he?\" Link said, to no one in particular.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Pettus answered. \"He\u0027s got that wicked seed in him, that\u0027s what. My Melissa sees him at school every day and he\u0027s always picking fights, isn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Momma,\" she replied, and pulled away from her mother\u0027s arm. \"That\u0027s not how it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always picking fights. And he\u0027s such a nice-lookin\u0027 boy, too, to have such bad blood in him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Billy\u0027s all right,\" Coy said. \"He\u0027s a smart boy. He\u0027ll go far if he can cut himself loose from that farm. Link, here\u0027re your cigarettes. How\u0027s work at the mill?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In bits and pieces,\" Link joked, trying to summon up a grin. The way Billy had stared at him had made him jittery. He paid for the cigarettes, went out to his pickup truck, and drove on toward the mill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLink parked his truck in the gravel lot, took a few pulls from a cigarette to calm his jittery nerves, then crushed it out and put on his heavy canvas safety gloves. Then he walked the few dozen yards to the main building, past bunks of yellow pine logs sitting alongside the railroad tracks; they were newly arrived, oozing sap, and ready to be hauled into the small pond behind the mill before the hot weather made them harden and swell. He went up a flight of rickety stairs to the main hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he opened the door, the noise of the saws was simply irritating; when he stepped inside, into a golden haze of sawdust and friction heat thrown off by the whirring circular saws, band saws, and ponies, the shrill scream of machinery pounded into his forehead like a sledgehammer. He fished earplugs from his pocket and screwed them in place, but they helped hardly at all. The smell of raw lumber and sawdust in the air scratched the back of Link\u0027s throat. He clocked in next to the glassed-in office where Lamar Chatham sat at his desk, the telephone to one ear and an index finger plugging the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mill was working at full speed. Link saw where he was needed - the master sawyer, Durkee, was operating the headrig and and aligning the logs, a two-man job that was slowing down the flow of timber - and hurried toward the far end of the line. He took his place next to the whining headrig and began operating the long lever that sped up or braked the circular saw, while grizzled old Durkee judged the raw logs and maneuvered them so they\u0027d go into the headrig at the proper angle and speed. Link worked the lever, adjusting the saw\u0027s speed to Durkee\u0027s shouted orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe logs kept coming, faster and faster Link settled down to the routine, watching the oil-smeared gauge set into the machinery next to him, reading the saw\u0027s speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBare light bulbs hung from the ceiling, illuminating the mill with a harsh and sometimes unreliable light: many men who\u0027d worked the mill were missing fingers because they couldn\u0027t judge exactly where a fast-spinning sawrim was, due to poor lighting. Link let himself relax, became part of the trembling headrig. His mind drifted to his new trailer. It had been a good buy, and now that his second child was on the way it was good that he, Susie, and his son Jeff were out of that shack they\u0027d lived in for years. It seemed that finally things were working out his way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDurkee shouted, \"This one\u0027s as punky as a rotten tooth!\" and jabbed at the wood with a logger\u0027s hook. \"Damn, what sorta shit they tryin\u0027 to pass through here!\" He reached out, pushed the log\u0027s far end a few inches to line it up correctly, and made a motion with his forefinger to give the saw more speed. Link pushed the lever forward. The log started coming through, sawdust whirling out of the deepening groove as the teeth sank in. The headrig vibrated suddenly, and Link thought: This sonofabitch is gonna come a -\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there was a loud crack! that vibrated through the mill. Link saw the log split raggedly as the saw slipped out of line. Durkee roared, \"SHUT HER DOWN!\" and Link wrenched the lever back, thinking I\u0027ve screwed up, I\u0027ve screwed up, I\u0027ve . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething flew up like a yellow dagger. The three-inch-long shard of wood pierced Link\u0027s left eye with a force that snapped his head back. He screamed in agony, clutched at his face, and stumbled forward, off-balance; instinctively he reached out to keep himself from going down . . . and the saw\u0027s scream turned into a hungry gobbling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help!\" Durkee shouted. \"Somebody cut the master switch!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLink staggered, blood streaming down his face. He lifted his right hand to clear his eyes, and saw in his hazed half-vision the wet nub of white bone that jutted from the mangled meat of his forearm. His hand, the fingers still twitching, was already moving down the conveyor belt wrapped in its bloody canvas glove.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the stump of his ruined arm shot blood like a firehose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVoices cut through the haze above him. \". . . call the doc, hurry . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... bandage it . . . tourniquet in the. . . !\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\". . . somebody call his wife!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My hand,\" Link whispered. \"Find ... my hand. . . .\" He couldn\u0027t remember now which hand was hurt, but he knew it had to be found so the doctor could stitch it back on. The sawdust around him was wet, his clothes were wet, everything was wet. A black wave roared through his head. \"No!\" he whispered. \". . . Not fair, not this way!\" Tears streamed down his cheeks, mingling with the blood. He was aware of someone knotting a shirt around his forearm; everything was moving in slow motion, everything was crazy and wrong. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"... too much blood, the damned thing\u0027s not gonna . . .\" a disembodied voice said, off in the distance. A shout, full of sharp echoes: \"... ambulance!\" and then fading away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe black wave came back again, seemingly lifting him up from where he sat. It scared him, and he fought against it with his teeth gritted. \"NO!\" he cried out. \"I WON\u0027T LET IT . . . be . . . like this. . . .\" The voices above him had merged into an indistinct mumbling. His eye hurt, that was the worst of it, and he couldn\u0027t see. \"Clean my eye off,\" he said, but no one seemed to hear. A surge of anger swelled in him, searing and indignant. There was still so much to do, he realized. His wife to take care of! The new baby! The trailer he was so proud of and had put so much work into! I won\u0027t let it be like this! he screamed inwardly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light was fading. Link said, \"I don\u0027t want it to get dark.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbove him, an ashen-faced and blood-spattered Durkee looked at the ring of stunned men and said, \"What\u0027d he say? Anybody hear him? Jesus, what a mess!\" Durkee went down on his knees, cradling the younger man\u0027s head. Now that all the saws were quiet, they could hear an ambulance coming, but it was still on the other side of Hawthorne.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were droplets of blood across the front of Lamar Chatham\u0027s white shirt. He was trembling, his hands curled into helpless fists at his sides. His brain was working furiously on two tracks: how to make up the work that was being lost and how to smooth this thing over with the safety inspectors. He saw Link Patterson\u0027s gloved hand lying on a conveyor belt like a large squashed spider; the air was rank with blood and icy with shock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDurkee rose to his feet. He let out a long sigh and shook his head. \"Somebody else\u0027ll have to close his eyes. I\u0027ve had enough.\" He walked past Chatham without looking back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e21\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn Creekmore stood stiffly in an ill-fitting black suit, the sun hot on his neck through a break in the pines. As Reverend Laken spoke, John looked back over bis shoulder at the figure sitting up the hill perhaps fifty yards away, watching the funeral through the rows of small granite tombstones. Billy had been up there since John had arrived, before the funeral had started. The boy hadn\u0027t moved a muscle, and John knew the others had seen him up there too. John looked away, trying to concentrate on what Hawthorne\u0027s new minister was saying, but he could feel Billy sitting back amid the pines; he shifted his weight uneasily from one foot to the other, not knowing what to do with his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Amen,\" Reverend Laken finally said. The coffin was cranked down into the ground, and Susie sobbed so terribly John had to walk away from her. He stood and stared up at his son for a moment. Billy was motionless. John thrust his hands into his pockets and walked carefully toward him between the mounds of earth, his shoes slipping on the carpet of fresh pine needles. The boy\u0027s face was a tight mask of secrets; John knew that Ramona and Billy kept a world of secrets from him - dark things that had to do with the time Billy had spent at his grandmother\u0027s house. John didn\u0027t want to know what they were, fearing contamination, but for one thing he could be happy: Rebekah Fairmountain had gone to her hellish reward two years ago. Ramona and Billy had found her on the day after Christmas, sitting with her eyes closed in her easy chair, a yellowed picture of her late husband and a red vase full of wild flowers on a table at her side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn reached his son. \"What\u0027re you doin\u0027 here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wanted to come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People saw you sittin\u0027 up here. Why didn\u0027t you come down?\" He shook his head, amber lights glinting in his eyes; he was unable to explain his feelings, but when he\u0027d seen that strange black haze clinging to Link Patterson he\u0027d known something terrible was about to happen. He hadn\u0027t told his mother about it until later, after Mr Patterson was lying dead up at the sawmill and the whole town knew there\u0027d been an awful accident. As he\u0027d watched the coffin being lowered, he\u0027d wondered if he had had the power to change the man\u0027s destiny, perhaps with a single word of warning, or if the accident was already waiting for Link Patterson to step into it and nothing Billy could\u0027ve said or done would\u0027ve mattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you come for?\" John asked. \"I thought you were supposed to be workin\u0027 at the gas station this afternoon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I asked for the afternoon off. It doesn\u0027t matter anyway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The hell it don\u0027t!\" John felt a flush of unreasoned anger heat his face. \"People see you sittin\u0027 up here among the graves, what are they gonna think? Damn it, boy! Don\u0027t you have a lick of sense anymore?\" He almost reached down and hauled Billy to his feet, but restrained himself; lately his nerves had been on edge all the time, and he lost his temper like a shatterpated fool. A pang of shame stabbed him. This is my son! he thought. Not a stranger I don\u0027t even know! He abruptly cleared his throat. \"You ready to go home now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked down the hill together, past the new grave with its bright bouquets of flowers, and to the Olds. The car was held together with more wire and odd junkyard pieces than Frankenstein\u0027s monster. The engine, when it finally caught, sounded as if it were gargling nuts and bolts. They drove out of the cemetery and toward home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn saw it first: a white pickup truck with Chatham brothers stenciled on its side in red was parked in front of the house. \"Now what?\" he said, and then thought: could be it\u0027s a job! His hands tightened around the steering wheel. Sure! They needed a new man on the line, since Link was ... He was sickened at what he was thinking, but - sickened or not - his heart was beating harder in anticipation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLamar Chatham himself was sitting on the front porch with Ramona. He rose to his feet, a short heavy man in a seersucker suit, as the Olds approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn stopped the car, then stepped out. He was sweating profusely in the dark suit. \"Howdy, Mr Chatham,\" he called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man nodded, chewing on a toothpick. \"Hello, Creekmore.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My son and I went to pay our respects to Link Patterson. That was a terrible thing, but I guess a man can\u0027t be too careful around those saws. I mean, when you\u0027re workin\u0027 fast you\u0027ve got to know what you\u0027re doin\u0027.\" He caught Ramona\u0027s dark gaze on him, and again he felt a hot surge of anger. \"I hear the mill\u0027s gonna be shut down for a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. I\u0027ve been waitin\u0027 to speak to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh? Well . . . what can I do for you, then?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChatham\u0027s fleshy face looked loose and slack, and there were gray patches beneath his blue eyes. He said, \"Not you, Creekmore. I\u0027ve been waitin\u0027 to speak to your boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My boy? What for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChatham took the toothpick from his mouth. \"I meant to go to the funeral,\" he said, \"but I had business. I sent some flowers, you probably saw \u0027em there. Orchids. One thing about funerals: they\u0027re supposed to be final, ain\u0027t they?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess so,\" John agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" He gazed off at the field for a moment, where a new crop of corn and pole beans were straggling out of the dusty earth. \"I came to see your wife, and we had a good long talk about . . . things. But she says I should speak to Billy.\" He looked at John again. \"Your wife says that Billy can do what has to be done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? What has to be done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Billy,\" the other man said quietly, \"I need to talk to you, boy. ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Talk to me, damn it!\" John\u0027s face flamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRamona\u0027s voice was as soft as a cool breeze, but carried strength as well. \"Tell him,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right.\" Chatham inserted his toothpick again, looking from Billy to John and back again. \"Yes ma\u0027am, I will. First off, I want you all to know I don\u0027t believe in ... in haunts.\" He gave a little lopsided grin that slipped off his uneasy face like thin grease. \"Nosir! Lamar Chatham never believed in anything he couldn\u0027t see! But, you know, the world\u0027s just full of superstitious folks who believe in rabbit\u0027s feet and demons and . . . and especially haunts. Now you take rugged men who work hard for a livin\u0027, and who work in a place that maybe - maybe - is dangerous. Sometimes they can be more superstitious than a gaggle of old farm women.\" He let out a nervous burp of a laugh, his cheeks swelling like a bullfrog\u0027s. \"Link Patterson\u0027s been dead three days, and now he\u0027s buried. But . . . sometimes superstitions can get hold of a man\u0027s mind and just gnaw at him. They can chew a man down to nothin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like that damned saw did to Link,\" John said bitterly, all hopes of a job dashed to the winds. And worse, this bastard Chatham wanted Billy!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Maybe so. Sawmill\u0027s closed now. Shut down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About time some work was done to make that place safe. Those belts and drive gears ain\u0027t been changed for years, I hear tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. Well, that ain\u0027t the reason the mill\u0027s shut down, Creekmore.\" He poked the toothpick at an offending bit of barbecue. \"The mill\u0027s shut down,\" he said, \"because the men won\u0027t work. I hired new ones. They walked out on me in less than an hour, yesterday. Production\u0027s fallin\u0027 behind. We turn a pretty fair profit, but too many days like these last few and\" - he whistled and drew the stump of his index finger across his thick neck in a slashing gesture - \"the whole town suffers for it. Hell, the sawmill is Hawthorne!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So what\u0027s that to us?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I came to see your wife because of who she is, and what her reputation says she can do. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get off my land.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now just a min - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"GET OFF, I SAID!\" he roared, and rushed the porch. Chatham stayed planted like a slab of wood, his thickset body tensed for a fight. He\u0027d been a logging man since he was old enough to swing an ax, and he\u0027d never run from a tangle yet in any of the rough camps where muscle was king. His posture and steady glare flared a warning, and John stopped halfway up the porch steps, his fists knotted and the cords in his neck as tense as piano wires. \"Maybe you\u0027ve got money,\" John snarled, \"and maybe you wear fancy suits and fancy rings and you can work men like dogs, but this is my land, mister! And I\u0027m tellin\u0027 you to move off of it, right now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Creekmore,\" Chatham said with a hiss of breath between his teeth, \"I own half this town. My brother owns the other half. Paper can be torn up, do you understand me? It can be misplaced. Listen, I don\u0027t want no trouble. Hell, I\u0027m tryin\u0027 to offer your boy a job and pay him for it, too! Now back off, man!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the porch swing, Ramona saw the trapped-animal look in her husband\u0027s eyes, and her heart ached. She sat with her hands clasped in her lap as John said, \"I don\u0027t ... I don\u0027t . . . want you here. ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Billy was coming up the steps, passing his father. He walked right up to Lamar Chatham and looked him directly in the eyes. \"Are you threatening my father, Mr Chatham?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. \u0027Course not. Hell, there\u0027s a lot of steam needs to be blowed off around here! Ain\u0027t that right, John?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other man whispered, \"Damn you . . . damn you. ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it you want with me?\" Billy asked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like I say, I had a long talk with your mother We came to an understandin\u0027, and she\u0027s asked me to talk to you. ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn made a strangling sound; then he stepped back down the stairs and stood facing the pond. He clamped his hands to his ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChatham paid him no attention. \"I don\u0027t believe in haunts, Billy. No such thing in my book. But a lot of the men do. They won\u0027t work and I had to close the mill because . . . because of the saw Link Patterson stuck his hand into.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The saw? What about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChatham glanced uneasily at Ramona Creekmore, then looked back into the boy\u0027s face. There were amber glints in Billy\u0027s eyes, and his gaze seemed so deeply penetrating Chatham thought he felt the short hairs at the back of his neck stir. Chatham said, \"The saw screams. Like a man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e22\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwilight framed the sawmill against a sky of blue and gold. Shards of sunlight lay across the gravel parking lot like pieces of broken glass, and bunked piles of timber threw dark blue shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You drink yet, boy?\" Lamar Chatham asked as he switched off the pickup\u0027s ignition and took the keys out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Time you started. Open that glove compartment there and fetch the bottle.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a flask of moonshine that Billy could smell even before Chatham uncapped it. The man took a swig and closed his eyes; Billy could almost see the veins in his bulbous nose lighting up. \"You believe me when I say I don\u0027t think there\u0027s such a thing as a haunt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I\u0027m a goddamned liar, boy. Sheeeit! My old daddy used to tell me ghost stories that made the hair on my ass curl! You won\u0027t catch me closer than a mile to a cemetery, that\u0027s for truth!\" He passed the flask to Billy. \"Mind you now, I don\u0027t care what you or your momma can or can\u0027t do. I\u0027ve heard the stories about your mother, and I was there that night at the Falconer tent revival. That was one hell of an uproar. Once you go in my mill and ... do whatever it is that has to be done, then I figure my men will come on back to work. And I\u0027ll make sure every last one of them knows what you did . . . even if you don\u0027t do a damned thing. Get my drift?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly nodded. His insides were quaking. When he\u0027d said he would help Mr. Chatham, his father had looked at him as if he were a leper But Mr Chantham had said he\u0027d pay fifty dollars and so wasn\u0027t it right, Billy reasoned, that he help out the family as much as he could? Still, he didn\u0027t know exactly what he was supposed to do; he\u0027d brought his good-luck piece of coal, but he knew that whatever had to be done would have to come from inside him, and he was on his own. Before he\u0027d left the house, his mother had taken him inside and talked to him quietly, telling him that his time had come now, and he would have to do the best he could. Oh, she\u0027d said, she could go with him this time to give him confidence, but it would all be his work anyway; there might not even be anything in the sawmill, she\u0027d told him, but if there was it could be part of Link Patterson, in agony and unable to find its way across. Draw it to you with trust, and remember the lessons your grandmother taught you. Most importantly: blank the fear out of your mind, if you can, and let the revenant find you. It\u0027ll be searching for help, and it\u0027ll be drawn to you as if you were a candle in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Billy had climbed into the white pickup truck, Ramona had stood on the porch and said to him, \"Remember, son: no fear. I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light was slowly fading. Billy sniffed at the moonshine and then took a drink. It felt like lava at the back of his throat, and bubbled down his gullet searing tissues all the way to his stomach; it reminded him of the stuff Gram had made him drink to clean his stomach out before he\u0027d gone into the smokehouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes at night, on the edge of sleep, he seemed to relive that entire strange experience. He\u0027d stayed inside that sweltering smokehouse for three days, wrapped in the heavy blanket, with nothing to eat and only home-brewed \"medicines\" to drink. Lulled by the fierce heat, he\u0027d drifted in the dark, losing all sense of time and space; his body had seemed cumbersome, like a suit of armor, trapping his real self within it. He was aware, though locked into sleep, of his mother and Gram looking in on him, and sitting with him for a while: he could tell the difference in their heartbeat, in their rhythms of breathing, in the aromas of their bodies and the sound of air parting around them as they moved. The crackling of the burning wood and leaves had become a kind of music alternating between soft harmony and rough pandemonium; smoke at the ceiling rustled like a silk shirt as it brushed the boards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he\u0027d finally awakened and had been allowed out of the smokehouse, the morning sunlight had pierced his skin like needles, and the quiet forests had seemed a riot of cacophonous noise. It was several more days yet before his senses had settled down enough for him to feel comfortable again, yet even so he was and had remained fantastically aware of colors, aromas, and sounds; thus the pain was terrible when they\u0027d returned home from Gram\u0027s, and his father had hit Ramona a backhanded blow across the face and then stropped Billy with a belt. Then the house was filled with his father\u0027s voice, torn between begging their forgiveness and loudly reading Bible verses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly looked at the golden streamers of cloud across the sky and thought of how the papier-mache decorations would look in the Fayette County High gym on May Night. He wanted very much to go to that dance, to fit in with all the others; he knew it might be his last chance. If he said no to Mr Chatham now, if he let everybody know he was just a scared kid who didn\u0027t know anything about haunts or spirits, then maybe he could ask Melissa Pettus, and maybe she\u0027d go with him to May Night and he\u0027d get a job as a mechanic in Fayette and everything would be just fine for the rest of his life. Anyway, he\u0027d hardly known Link Patterson, so what was he doing here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChatham said nervously, \"I want to get through with this before it gets dark. Okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly\u0027s shoulders slowly sagged forward. He got out of the truck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey walked in silence up the wooden steps to the sawmill\u0027s entrance. Chatham fumbled with a ring of keys and then unlocked the door; before he stepped inside he reached in and switched on several banks of dimly glowing blubs that studded the raftered ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreased machinery gleamed in the mixture of electric light and the last orange sunlight that filtered through a series of high, narrow windows. The smells of dust, woodsap, and machine oil thickened the air, and the place seemed hazed with a residue of sawdust. Chatham closed the door and motioned to the far end of the building. \"It happened up there, right at the headrig. I\u0027ll show you.\" His voice sounded hollow in the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChatham stopped ten feet away from the headrig and pointed at it. Billy approached the saw, his shoes stirring up whorls of dust, and gingerly touched the large, jagged teeth. \"He should\u0027ve been wearin\u0027 safety glasses,\" Chatham said. \"It wasn\u0027t my fault. Punky timber comes in all the time, it\u0027s a fact of life. He ... he died about where you\u0027re standin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly looked at the floor. Sawdust had been spread over a huge brown stain; his mind went back to the stained floor in the Booker house, the hideous mark of death hidden with newspapers. The saw\u0027s teeth were cold against his hand; if he was supposed to feel anything here, he didn\u0027t: no electric shock, no sudden sure realization, nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m gonna turn it on now,\" Chatham said quietly. \"You\u0027d best stand back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly retreated a few paces and put his hands in his pockets, gripping in his right hand the lump of coal. Chatham unlocked a small red box mounted to the wall; there was a series of red buttons and a red lever. He slowly pulled the lever down and Billy herd a generator come to life. The lights brightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA chain rattled, and an engine moaned as it gained power. The headrig\u0027s circular saw began spinning, slowly at first, then rapidly picking up speed until it was a silver-blue blur. It hummed - a machine sound, Billy thought; not a human sound at all. He could feel Mr. Chatham watching him. He thought of faking it, of pretending to hear something because Chatham seemed to expect it. But no, no, that wouldn\u0027t be right. He looked over his shoulder and raised his voice to be heard above the saw\u0027s metallic noise. \"I don\u0027t hear any . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe saw\u0027s voice abruptly changed; it made a shrill sound like a startled cry of pain, then what might have been a harsh grunt of surprise. The noise rippled and faded, and then the machine-humming had returned again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly stared at it, his jaw slack. He wasn\u0027t certain what he\u0027d heard; now the saw was quiet, running almost silently but for the clatter of chains. He stepped away from it a few paces, and heard Chatham\u0027s harsh breathing behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then there was a high, terrible scream - an eerie union of a human voice and the sound of the spinning saw - that reverberated through the mill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scream faded and died; then came back, stronger than before, more frantic and anguished. With the third scream the windows rattled in their loose casements. Billy had broken out in a cold sweat, the urge to flee from this place gnawing at the back of his neck; he put his hands to his ears to block out the next scream, but he heard it in his bones. He twisted around, saw Chatham\u0027s bleached face and terror-stricken eyes; the man was reaching for the lever, to cut power to the headrig.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scream carried a high note of desperate pleading; and it was the same scream over and over, rising in the same pattern of notes to an abrupt end. Billy\u0027s decision was made: whatever this was, he wouldn\u0027t run from it. \"No!\" he shouted. Chatham froze. \"Don\u0027t turn it off!\" Each scream was seemingly louder than the one before, each one freezing his spine a little harder. He had to get outside to think, he had to figure out what to do, he couldn\u0027t stand this sound anymore and his whole brain was about to burst open. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly turned and started for the door, his hands clamped over his ears. Just a machine noise, he told himself. That\u0027s all . . . that\u0027s all . . . that\u0027s . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound suddenly changed pitch. Through the screaming there was a hushed metallic whisper that stopped the boy in his tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilllleeeee. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jesus Christ!\" Chatham croaked. He was plastered against the wall, his face shiny with sweat. \"It . . . knows you\u0027re here! It knows you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly turned and shouted, \"It\u0027s just a noise, that\u0027s all! It\u0027s just a . . . just a . . .\" The words choked in his throat; when his voice bubbled up again it was in a frantic yell: \"You\u0027re dead! You\u0027re dead! You\u0027re . . . !\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbove the headrig a light bulb popped and exploded, raining hot fragments of glass. Then another, in the next row of bulbs; blue sparks of electricity leaped from the sockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a demon! It\u0027s the goddamned Devil himself!\" Chatham grasped the red lever and started to throw it. Above his head a bulb exploded and glass hornets stung the man\u0027s scalp; he yelped in pain and huddled to the floor, his arms up to protect his head. Two more blubs blew at the same time, zigzagging arcs of electricity. The air was full of ozone, and Billy could feel his hair dancing on his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilllleeeee . . . Billlleeeee . . . Billlleeeee. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"STOP IT!\" Bulbs were popping all across the mill now, glass tinkling down into the machinery like off-key piano notes. An instant of sheer panic shook through Billy, but he stood firm until it had passed. No fear, he remembered his mother saying. And then he tasted blood in his mouth and realized he\u0027d bitten into his lower lip. He concentrated on rooting himself to the floor, on clinging to what his mother had told him before he\u0027d left the house. The mill\u0027s air had turned tumultuous, thick and hazed; most of the bulbs had exploded, the rest throwing harsh shadows. \"STOP IT!\" Billy shouted again. \"STOP IT, MR. PATTERSON!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDown at the other end of the mill, another bulb popped. The saw\u0027s scream faltered, fading to a low moan, a rumbling that seemed to shake the floor He\u0027d called the thing by name, Billy realized, and that had made a difference. It was, in its own way responding. He stepped past the cowering man on the floor \"You don\u0027t have to stay here anymore!\" Billy shouted. \"You can . . . you can go on to where you\u0027re supposed to be! Don\u0027t you understand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSofter: Billlleeeee . . . Billlleeeee. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t belong here anymore! You\u0027ve got to go on!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilllleeeee. . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"LISTEN TO ME! You . . . you can\u0027t go home anymore, not to your wife and kids. You\u0027ve just got to . . . stop trying so hard to stay here. There\u0027s no sense in . . .\" And then something seemed to crash into him, staggering him back; he moaned, feeling panic bloom in his head like a dark flower. He went to his knees in the sawdust, and his head was jarred as a savage pain sliced into his left eye. There was a burning fever of rage and agony in him, bubbling up to the top of his throat; and then his mouth opened as if it had been forced by rough, spectral hands, and he heard himself cry out, \"No no it\u0027s not my time yet! I want to be back again, I\u0027m lost, I\u0027m lost and I can\u0027t find my way back! ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChatham whined like a dog, watching the boy writhe and jerk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly shook his head to clear it. He shouted, \"You can\u0027t come back! I saw Link Patterson buried today! You can\u0027t come back, you have to let everything go! No no I\u0027m lost, I\u0027ve got to find my way back! You have to rest and forget the pain! You have to help me I\u0027m lost oh God help me!\" And then he howled in torment, because he\u0027d had the quick and clear vision of his right hand being chewed away to bloody bone; he cradled the phantom injury to his chest, and rocked back and forth with tears streaming down his cheeks. \"I feel it!\" he moaned. \"I feel how it was for you! Oh God . . . please . . . just let the pain go, let everything go . . . just rest and let go. No fear ... no fear . . . no . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe headrig vibrated, about to tear its cleats from the floor. Billy looked up, saw something like a thin blue haze between him and the machine. It undulated and began to take on the shape of a man. \"You don\u0027t have to be afraid,\" Billy whispered. His arm was on fire, and he gritted his teeth to hold back a scream. \"I\u0027ve got the pain now. Just ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the blue haze moved toward him, thickening and roiling; when it touched him he was enveloped with cold and sheer dread, and he recoiled from it, trying to crawl away through the dust. Terror of the unknown swept through him, and he clenched his hands against the floor as if resisting a huge frigid wave. He heard himself shrieking, \". . . let gooooooooo! . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe windows shattered with the noise of shotguns going off, all exploding outward as if from a terrible, awesome pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the saw was humming again, the headrig slowing its rocking motions, slowing, slowing . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA last light bulb flickered, flickered, and went out. The remaining few buzzed and blinked, and raw sparks jumped from the open sockets. The saw\u0027s sound pitched softer, until there was only the noise of the humming generator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLying on his side in the dust, Billy heard the mill\u0027s door slam shut. Then, in another moment, an engine started. Tires threw gravel. He raised his head with an effort, one side of his face pasted with sawdust, and saw that Mr. Chatham had fled. He lay back down again, totally exhausted; within him flowed the currents of desperate emotions, of fear and confusion and loss. He was sure that he now held within himself the emotions that had bound Link Patterson to this sawmill, to this world, perhaps even to the moment of physical death. He wasn\u0027t certain if he\u0027d done it right or not, but he didn\u0027t think there was anything left of Mr. Patterson; the revenant had passed on, leaving its pain behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBilly forced himself to his feet. The saw was spinning silently, and he turned off the power. Billy clutched his right wrist and worked his hand. There was a needles-and-pins sensation in it, as if the blood flow had been cut off. A soft, warm breeze was blowing in through the shattered windows; in the last blue light a fine mist of golden dust was stirred up and floated through the air to coat the silent sawmill machinery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he was strong enough to move, Billy started home. His legs were leaden, and a dull pressure throbbed at his temples; for one thing he was grateful though - the feeling was slowly seeping back into his right hand. He took a shortcut through the dark and quiet forest, with the man in the moon grinning down, and prayed he\u0027d never have to do anything like what happened tonight again. I\u0027m not strong enough, he told himself. I never was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNearer Hawthorne, he was startled by something moving at the crest of a rise, there amid pines and boulders. It looked like a large man in the moonlight, but there was something animalish and disturbing about it. Billy stood still for a moment, his senses questing, but the figure was gone. As he skirted the rise, he thought he\u0027d seen moonlight glinting wetly off what might have been curved, sharp tusks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he remembered the beast\u0027s warning and promise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll be waiting for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e23\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Feed the fire, brothers and sisters!\" Jimmy Jed Falconer roared, his face licked with firelight above the bright yellow suit. \"Feed the fire and starve the Devil!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood on a wooden platform out in the middle of a dusty dumping ground near Birmingham. A backdrop had been constructed to hold the huge FALCONER CRUSADE banner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalconer grinned. Before him was a huge crackling circle of fire, feeding on hundreds of pounds of paper and several hundred black vinyl discs. There was a line of teen-agers waiting to throw their record albums into the flames and people with boxes of books obtained from school and public libraries. The service had been going on for almost three hours, starting with psalm singing, then one of J.J. Falconer\u0027s most searing sermons on the Devil trying to consume America\u0027s youth, followed by an hour-long healing session that had left people dancing and talking in tongues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBurning pages wafted into the air like fiery bats. Embers puffed out and drifted down. Records cracked and melted. \"Here, gimme those, son.\" Falconer carefully leaned over the platform\u0027s edge and took several records from a heavyset young man with newly cropped black hair and acne scars. He looked at the jacket art, all psychedelic drawings and pictures, and held up one of them, by a group called Cream. \"Yeah, this\u0027ll \u0027blow your mind,\u0027 won\u0027t it? It\u0027ll send you to Hell, that\u0027s what it\u0027ll do!\" He sailed the record into the fire, to shouts and applause. The Jefferson Airplane flew into the flames next, followed by Paul Revere and the Raiders. \"Is this what the Lord wants you to hear?\" he asked, baiting the crowd. \"Does He want you to grow your hair to your knees and take drugs and \u0027blow your mind\u0027?\" He tossed Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs into the flames.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were resounding cheers as Falconer broke a Beatles record over his knee, then held it at the jacket\u0027s edge, with his other hand clamping shut his nostrils. He threw it in to burn. \"Folks, if somebody tells you that everybody\u0027s growin\u0027 long hair and fillin\u0027 themselves full of LSD and runnin\u0027 away from the Commies like yellow cowards, then you tell them this: I\u0027m the American majority, and I\u0027m proud to . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly he couldn\u0027t draw a breath. A sharp, cold pain ripped across his chest, and he felt as if he might pass out. He held the microphone at his side, afraid that it might pick up his whimper of agony; then he was sinking down to his knees, his head bent over, and he heard people clapping and hollering, thinking that this was all part of his message. He squeezed his eyes shut. Oh God, he thought. Not again . . . please . . . take this pain away. He struggled to draw in air, his chest heaving, but he stayed crouched on his knees so no one could see his graying face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Burn it!\" he heard a high, merry voice shout.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hand gripped his fleshy shoulder \"Dad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalconer looked up into his son\u0027s face. The boy was growing into a handsome young man, with a lean strong body that looked trim in the tan suit he wore. He had a long, sharp-chinned face topped with a mass of thickly curled red hair, and now his deep-set, electric-blue eyes glinted with concern. \"You all right, Dad?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lost my breath,\" Falconer said, and tried to struggle to his feet. \"Let me rest for just a minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne glanced out at the congregation, and realized they were waiting for someone to lead them. He grasped the microphone his father held.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Wayne,\" Falconer said, grinning, with the sweat running down his face. \"I\u0027m fine. Just lost my breath is all. It\u0027s the heat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The TV cameras are on us, Dad,\" Wayne said, and pulled the microphone away from his father As Wayne straightened up and turned toward the congregation, his face abruptly pulled tight, the blue eyes widening and the perfect white teeth showing in a wide smile that hung on the edge of a grimace. His body tensed, as if gripping the microphone had sent a charge of power through him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The glory of the Lord is with us tonight!\" Wayne crowed. \"It\u0027s cracklin\u0027 in the air, it\u0027s fillin\u0027 our hearts and souls, it\u0027s put my daddy on his knees because it\u0027s not a weak thing, no it\u0027s not a frail thing, no it\u0027s not a feeble thing! If you want to listen to sex- and drug-music and you want to read sex- and drug-books, you\u0027ll be real happy in Hell, neighbors! Lord says WHAT?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"BURN IT!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWayne balanced on the edge, seemingly about to leap into the fire himself. \"Lord says WHAT?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Burn it! Burn it! Burn ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalconer knew the boy had them now. The local TV station cameras were aimed at the young healer. Falconer rose unsteadily to his feet. The pain was gone and he knew he\u0027d be all right. But he wanted to get back to the Airstream trailer to rest, then he\u0027d return and give the benediction. He made his way across the platform to the steps. All eyes were on Wayne. Falconer stopped for a moment to turn back and watch his son. Wayne\u0027s entire body seemed to glow with energy, with wonderful strength and youth. It was Wayne who\u0027d come up with the idea of holding a \"sin-burning,\" sure that there would be local media coverage. The ideas and plans just seemed to pop out of the boy\u0027s head fully formed; Wayne had suggested they move the Crusade into Louisiana, Mississippi, and Georgia, and into Florida where they could work year-round. The schedules had been drawn up, and for the past seven years the Crusade had expanded like a tick on a bloodhound. Now Wayne was talking about pushing the Crusade into Texas, where there were so many little towns and so far apart, and he wanted Falconer to buy a Fayette radio station that was about to lose its license. Wayne was taking flying lessons, and had already piloted the Crusade\u0027s Beechraft on short business trips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy was strong and had God in his heart, Falconer knew, but still . . . something ate at Wayne, day and night. Something drove him, and tried to control him. He had fits of moods and temper, and sometimes he locked himself in the prayer chapel at home for hours on end. And Wayne had been complaining of a strange recurring nightmare lately, some nonsense about a snake and an eagle. Falconer couldn\u0027t make heads or tails of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalconer was tired. He felt a sudden and awful pang of jealousy, and of anger at growing older and heavier and weaker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked toward the trailer. His heart was deteriorating, the doctors had told him. Why, as he\u0027d asked himself many times, was he afraid to ask Wayne to heal his heart, to patch up the leaks and make him strong again?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis answer was always the same as well: Because he was deeply afraid that Wayne\u0027s healing Toby had been a strange - and terrible - fluke. And if Wayne tried to heal him and nothing happened, then . . . What had stayed with him for seven years was the voice of that Creekmore woman, the Hawthorne Valley witch, raised to tell everybody that he and his young son were murderers of the worst kind. Down deep inside, far from the light, in a dark place that knew neither God nor Satan but was instead wholly frightened animal, a nerve of truth had been trembling for seven long years. What if? What . . . if . . . ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if Wayne already knew? And had known since he\u0027d touched the legs of a little girl whose frightened mind had kept her from wanting to walk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Falconer said. \"No. The Lord\u0027s workin\u0027 through my son. He healed a dumb animal, didn\u0027t he? He\u0027s healed more than a thousand people.\" He shook his head. He had to shut off his thinking before it was harmful. He reached the shining silver trailer, unlocked it, and stepped inside. There was a plaque on the wall that said believe, and that was good enough for him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mystery-walk/page-7.html","bookId":2478,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:52:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:52:32 PM"}
