He felt wronged and outraged by the unfounded charge that had been made against him. Why, he argued, should Mr. Drummond so readily decide that he had cheated him out of five dollars? He felt that he could not, with any self-respect, remain any longer under the same roof with a man who had such a poor opinion of him. \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was not sorry that his engagement was at an end. He had obtained some knowledge of the dry-goods business, and he knew that his services were worth more than his board. Then again, though he was not particular about living luxuriously, the fare at Mr. Drummond\u0027s was so uncommonly poor that he did sometimes long for one of the abundant and well-cooked meals which he used to have spread[Pg 186] before him at home, or even at his boarding-house while a pupil of the Essex Classical Institute.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He was packing his trunk when a step was heard on the stairs, and his door was opened by Mr. Drummond, considerably to Walter\u0027s surprise.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The fact is, that Mr. Drummond, on realizing what a mistake he had made, and that Joshua was the real culprit, felt that he had gone altogether too far, and he realized that he would be severely censured by Walter\u0027s friends in Willoughby. Besides, it was just possible that Walter might, after all, recover a few thousand dollars from his father\u0027s estate, and therefore it was better to be on good terms with him.
