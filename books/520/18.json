{"id":44684,"no":18,"title":"8th hour, Monday","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I hope you aren\u0027t the Trustee who sat on the toad? It went off--\n\u003cbr\u003e I was told--with quite a pop, so probably he was a fatter Trustee.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Do you remember the little dugout places with gratings over them\n\u003cbr\u003e by the laundry windows in the John Grier Home? Every spring when the\n\u003cbr\u003e hoptoad season opened we used to form a collection of toads and keep\n\u003cbr\u003e them in those window holes; and occasionally they would spill over\n\u003cbr\u003e into the laundry, causing a very pleasurable commotion on wash days. \n\u003cbr\u003e We were severely punished for our activities in this direction,\n\u003cbr\u003e but in spite of all discouragement the toads would collect.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And one day--well, I won\u0027t bore you with particulars--but somehow,\n\u003cbr\u003e one of the fattest, biggest, JUCIEST toads got into one of those\n\u003cbr\u003e big leather arm chairs in the Trustees\u0027 room, and that afternoon\n\u003cbr\u003e at the Trustees\u0027 meeting--But I dare say you were there and recall\n\u003cbr\u003e the rest?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Looking back dispassionately after a period of time, I will say\n\u003cbr\u003e that punishment was merited, and--if I remember rightly--adequate.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I don\u0027t know why I am in such a reminiscent mood except that\n\u003cbr\u003e spring and the reappearance of toads always awakens the old\n\u003cbr\u003e acquisitive instinct. The only thing that keeps me from starting\n\u003cbr\u003e a collection is the fact that no rule exists against it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e After chapel, Thursday\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e What do you think is my favourite book? Just now, I mean; I change\n\u003cbr\u003e every three days. Wuthering Heights. Emily Bronte was quite young\n\u003cbr\u003e when she wrote it, and had never been outside of Haworth churchyard. \n\u003cbr\u003e She had never known any men in her life; how COULD she imagine a man\n\u003cbr\u003e like Heathcliffe?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I couldn\u0027t do it, and I\u0027m quite young and never outside the John\n\u003cbr\u003e Grier Asylum--I\u0027ve had every chance in the world. Sometimes a\n\u003cbr\u003e dreadful fear comes over me that I\u0027m not a genius. Will you be\n\u003cbr\u003e awfully disappointed, Daddy, if I don\u0027t turn out to be a great author? \n\u003cbr\u003e In the spring when everything is so beautiful and green and budding,\n\u003cbr\u003e I feel like turning my back on lessons, and running away to play with\n\u003cbr\u003e the weather. There are such lots of adventures out in the fields! \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s much more entertaining to live books than to write them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Ow ! ! ! ! ! !\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That was a shriek which brought Sallie and Julia and (for a\n\u003cbr\u003e disgusted moment) the Senior from across the hall. It was caused\n\u003cbr\u003e by a centipede like this: only worse. Just as I had finished the\n\u003cbr\u003e last sentence and was thinking what to say next--plump!--it fell off\n\u003cbr\u003e the ceiling and landed at my side. I tipped two cups off the tea\n\u003cbr\u003e table in trying to get away. Sallie whacked it with the back of my\n\u003cbr\u003e hair brush--which I shall never be able to use again--and killed\n\u003cbr\u003e the front end, but the rear fifty feet ran under the bureau and escaped.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e This dormitory, owing to its age and ivy-covered walls, is full\n\u003cbr\u003e of centipedes. They are dreadful creatures. I\u0027d rather find\n\u003cbr\u003e a tiger under the bed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Friday, 9.30 p.m.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Such a lot of troubles! I didn\u0027t hear the rising bell this morning,\n\u003cbr\u003e then I broke my shoestring while I was hurrying to dress and\n\u003cbr\u003e dropped my collar button down my neck. I was late for breakfast\n\u003cbr\u003e and also for first-hour recitation. I forgot to take any blotting\n\u003cbr\u003e paper and my fountain pen leaked. In trigonometry the Professor\n\u003cbr\u003e and I had a disagreement touching a little matter of logarithms. \n\u003cbr\u003e On looking it up, I find that she was right. We had mutton stew\n\u003cbr\u003e and pie-plant for lunch--hate \u0027em both; they taste like the asylum. \n\u003cbr\u003e The post brought me nothing but bills (though I must say that I\n\u003cbr\u003e never do get anything else; my family are not the kind that write).\n\u003cbr\u003e In English class this afternoon we had an unexpected written lesson. \n\u003cbr\u003e This was it:\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I asked no other thing,\n\u003cbr\u003e No other was denied.\n\u003cbr\u003e I offered Being for it;\n\u003cbr\u003e The mighty merchant smiled.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Brazil? He twirled a button\n\u003cbr\u003e Without a glance my way:\n\u003cbr\u003e But, madam, is there nothing else\n\u003cbr\u003e That we can show today?\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e That is a poem. I don\u0027t know who wrote it or what it means. It\n\u003cbr\u003e was simply printed out on the blackboard when we arrived and we\n\u003cbr\u003e were ordered to comment upon it. When I read the first verse\n\u003cbr\u003e I thought I had an idea--The Mighty Merchant was a divinity\n\u003cbr\u003e who distributes blessings in return for virtuous deeds--\n\u003cbr\u003e but when I got to the second verse and found him twirling a button,\n\u003cbr\u003e it seemed a blasphemous supposition, and I hastily changed my mind. \n\u003cbr\u003e The rest of the class was in the same predicament; and there we\n\u003cbr\u003e sat for three-quarters of an hour with blank paper and equally\n\u003cbr\u003e blank minds. Getting an education is an awfully wearing process!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But this didn\u0027t end the day. There\u0027s worse to come.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It rained so we couldn\u0027t play golf, but had to go to gymnasium instead. \n\u003cbr\u003e The girl next to me banged my elbow with an Indian club. I got\n\u003cbr\u003e home to find that the box with my new blue spring dress had come,\n\u003cbr\u003e and the skirt was so tight that I couldn\u0027t sit down. Friday is\n\u003cbr\u003e sweeping day, and the maid had mixed all the papers on my desk. \n\u003cbr\u003e We had tombstone for dessert (milk and gelatin flavoured with vanilla).\n\u003cbr\u003e We were kept in chapel twenty minutes later than usual to listen to\n\u003cbr\u003e a speech about womanly women. And then--just as I was settling down\n\u003cbr\u003e with a sigh of well-earned relief to The Portrait of a Lady, a girl\n\u003cbr\u003e named Ackerly, a dough-faced, deadly, unintermittently stupid girl,\n\u003cbr\u003e who sits next to me in Latin because her name begins with A (I\n\u003cbr\u003e wish Mrs. Lippett had named me Zabriski), came to ask if Monday\u0027s\n\u003cbr\u003e lesson commenced at paragraph 69 or 70, and stayed ONE HOUR. \n\u003cbr\u003e She has just gone.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Did you ever hear of such a discouraging series of events? \n\u003cbr\u003e It isn\u0027t the big troubles in life that require character. \n\u003cbr\u003e Anybody can rise to a crisis and face a crushing tragedy with courage,\n\u003cbr\u003e but to meet the petty hazards of the day with a laugh--I really\n\u003cbr\u003e think that requires SPIRIT.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s the kind of character that I am going to develop. I am\n\u003cbr\u003e going to pretend that all life is just a game which I must play\n\u003cbr\u003e as skilfully and fairly as I can. If I lose, I am going to shrug\n\u003cbr\u003e my shoulders and laugh--also if I win.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Anyway, I am going to be a sport. You will never hear me\n\u003cbr\u003e complain again, Daddy dear, because Julia wears silk stockings\n\u003cbr\u003e and centipedes drop off the wall.\n\u003cbr\u003e Yours ever,\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Answer soon.\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59740.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
