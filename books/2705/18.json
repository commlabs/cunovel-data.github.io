He loved his uncle Dan, who was tall and confident and funny and drove a cool truck and was always taking Asher places—like to the movies and car races and even hunting. Uncle Dan seemed like the kind of uncle every kid dreams of having. I remember liking him immediately when we first met. He really seemed like a great guy, which makes it all the worse.61\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when Asher came back from this particular fishing trip—something wasn’t right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe had this project for school we were working on—about ancient civilizations—and we had picked the Incas. We were putting the finishing touches on a miniature Machu Picchu at his house the Sunday night after he returned from fishing with Uncle Dan. I remember Asher wouldn’t look me in the eye and kept saying “Nothing!” way too loud every time I asked if anything were wrong. Finally he said, “If you ask me what’s wrong one more time, I’m going to beat the shit out of you.” He stared at me—like he wanted to kill me and was capable of doing it too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t say anything as we finished creating our Machu Picchu. We had built the skeleton out of LEGOs, had used real sod for the grass, and had been making little cube-shaped papier-mâché buildings for weeks. In my memory, the project looks magnificent—like I’d never made something so beautiful before or since. And Asher had been really proud of it just the week before—excited even. But just as I put the final bit of paint on the last structure, Asher started to smash the project with his fists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What are you doing?” I yelled, because we had spent weeks on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe just kept punching and smashing, sending down fists from above like some cruel boy-god.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was so fucking awful to watch—not just because he was ruining all of our hard work, but because I could clearly see he was coming undone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to grab him and he punched me in the face hard—giving me a black eye. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/forgive-me-leonard-peacock/page-18.html","bookId":2705,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:33 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:28:33 AM"}
