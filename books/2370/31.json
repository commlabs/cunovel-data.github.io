She could not wait to hear what Kelly had learned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn elevator door opened and the passengers moved out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Going up?\" \"Yes.\" Diane stepped inside. \"The penthouse, please.\" Her mind was racing. What project could our husbands have been working on that was so secret that they were murdered? And how had Kelly found the answer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople began to crowd in. The elevator door closed and it started to rise. Diane had seen Kelly only a few hours ago, and to her surprise, she found that she missed her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, after half a dozen stops, the elevator operator opened the door and said, \"Penthouse floor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eINSIDE THE LIVING room of penthouse A, Flint waited close to the door, trying to listen for sounds in the hallway. The problem was that the door was unusually thick, and Flint knew why. It was not to keep sounds out. It was to keep them in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoardroom meetings were held in the penthouse suite, but Flint liked to joke that no one was ever bored. Three times a year, Tanner invited KIG managers from a dozen countries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the business meetings were adjourned, a bevy of beautiful girls was brought in to entertain the men. Flint had been a guard at several of the orgies, and now, as he stood there, thinking about the sea of naked, nubile bodies moaning and thrashing about on the beds and couches, he began to get an erection. Flint grinned. The ladies would take care of it soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry Flint did not consider himself a necrophiliac. He had never killed a woman in order to have sex with her. But if she were already dead?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAS DIANE STEPPED out of the elevator, she asked, \"Which way is penthouse A?\" \"It\u0027s to the left, at the end of the corridor. But there\u0027s no one there.\" Diane turned. \"What?\" \"That penthouse is only used for board meetings, and the next one isn\u0027t until September.\" Diane smiled. \"I\u0027m not going to a board meeting. I\u0027m seeing a friend who\u0027s waiting for me.\" The elevator operator watched as Diane turned left and walked toward penthouse A. He shrugged, closed the elevator door, and started down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Diane was approaching the door to the penthouse, she began to walk faster, her excitement starting to build.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eINSIDE PENTHOUSE A, Flint was waiting for the knock on the door. Which one of them will get here first-the blonde or the black chick? It doesn\u0027t matter. I\u0027m not prejudiced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlint thought he heard someone approaching the door, and he tightened his grip on the gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKELLY WAS FIGHTING to control her impatience. Getting to the Delmont Hotel had been a series of delays: traffic?red lights?road repairs?She was late. She hurried through the lobby of the hotel and got into an elevator. \"Penthouse, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eON THE FIFTIETH floor, as Diane approached penthouse A, the door to the neighboring suite opened and a bellman came out, backing into the corridor, pulling a large cart filled with luggage, blocking Diane\u0027s passage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll have this out of your way in a minute,\" he apologized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bellman returned to the suite and came out with two more suitcases. Diane tried to squeeze by, but there was no room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bellman said, \"All set. Sorry for the delay.\" He moved the luggage cart out of the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiane walked over to penthouse A and raised her hand to knock on the door when a voice down the hall said, \"Diane!\" Diane turned. Kelly had just stepped out of an elevator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kelly-!\" Diane hurried back down the hall to meet her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eINSIDE THE PENTHOUSE, Harry Flint was listening. Was someone out there? He could have opened the door to see, but that would have ruined the plan. Kill them as soon as they walk in the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the corridor, Kelly and Diane were hugging, delighted to see each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly said, \"Sorry I\u0027m late, Diane, but the traffic was terrible. You caught me just as my bus was leaving for Chicago.\" Diane looked at Kelly, puzzled. \"I caught you-?\" \"I was just getting on my bus when you called.\" There was a momentary silence. \"Kelly-I didn\u0027t call you. You called me. To tell me that you had the evidence we needed to-\" She saw the stricken look on Kelly\u0027s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t-\" They both turned to look at penthouse A.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDiane took a deep breath. \"Let\u0027s-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\" They raced down one flight of stairs, got into an elevator, and were out of the hotel in three minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside the penthouse, Harry Flint was looking at his watch. What\u0027s keeping the bitches?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDlANE AND KELLY were seated in a crowded subway car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know how they did it,\" Diane said. \"It was your voice.\" \"And it was your voice. They\u0027re not going to stop until they kill us. They\u0027re like octopi with a thousand bloody arms that they want to wrap around our necks.\" \"They have to catch us before they can kill us,\" Diane said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could they have found us this time? We got rid of Kingsley\u0027s business cards, and we have nothing else that they-\" They looked at each other, then looked at their cell phones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly said wonderingly, \"But how could they have found out our phone numbers?\" \"Don\u0027t ask. Anyway, this is probably the safest place in New York. We can stay on the subway until-\" Diane glanced across the aisle and her face paled. \"We\u0027re getting out of here,\" she said urgently. \"Next stop.\" \"What? You just said-?\" Kelly followed Diane\u0027s eyes. On the advertising strip that ran above the windows was a photograph of a smiling Kelly, holding up a beautiful ladies\u0027 watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, my God!\" They rose and hurried to the door, waiting for the next stop. Two uniformed marines, seated nearby, were ogling them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly smiled at the men as she took Diane\u0027s cell phone and her own and handed one to each marine. \"We\u0027ll call you.\" And the women were gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIN PENTHOUSE A, the telephone rang. Flint snatched it up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTanner said, \"It\u0027s been over an hour. What\u0027s going on, Mr. Flint?\" \"They never showed up.\" \"What?\" \"I\u0027ve been here all the time, waiting.\" \"Get back to the office.\" Tanner slammed the receiver down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIN THE BEGINNING, this had been a routine bit of business that Tanner had to dispose of. Now it had become personal. Tanner picked up his cell phone and dialed Diane\u0027s cell number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the marines to whom Kelly had given their cell phones answered. \"There you are, baby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow would you two like to have a big treat tonight?\" The bitches have gotten rid of their phones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIT WAS A cheap-looking boardinghouse on a small street on the West Side. When the taxi started to pass it and Diane and Kelly saw the sign vacancy, Diane said, \"You can stop here, driver.\" The women got out and walked up to the front door of the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe landlady, who opened the door, was a pleasant, middle-aged woman named Alexandra Upshaw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can give you a very nice room for forty dollars a night, with breakfast.\" Diane said, \"That will be fine.\" She looked at Kelly\u0027s expression. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" \"Nothing.\" Kelly closed her eyes for an instant. This boarding-house had nothing to do with the boardinghouse she had been brought up in, cleaning toilets and cooking for strangers and listening to the sounds of her drunken stepfather beating her mother. She managed a smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE NEXT MORNING, Tanner was in a meeting with Flint and Carballo. \"They\u0027ve disposed of my business cards,\" Tanner said, \"and they\u0027ve gotten rid of their phones.\" Flint said, \"So, we\u0027ve lost them.\" Tanner said, \"No, Mr. Flint, not while I\u0027m alive. We\u0027re not going after them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027re coming to us.\" The two men looked at each other, then back at Tanner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" \"Diane Stevens and Kelly Harris will be here at KIG Monday morning at eleven-fifteen.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-31.html","bookId":2370,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:00 AM"}
