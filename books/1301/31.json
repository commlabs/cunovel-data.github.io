{"id":10202,"no":31,"title":"CHAPTER 30","content":"Summer had howled the day Bran had fallen, and for long after as he lay broken in his bed; Robb had told him so before he went away to war. Summer had mourned for him, and Shaggydog and Grey Wind had joined in his grief. And the night the bloody raven had brought word of their father’s death, the wolves had known that too. Bran had been in the maester’s turret with Rickon talking of the children of the forest when Summer and Shaggydog had drowned out Luwin with their howls.\u0026nbsp; Who are they mourning now? Had some enemy slain the King in the North, who used to be his brother Robb? Had his bastard brother Jon Snow fallen from the Wall? Had his mother died, or one of his sisters? Or was this something else, as maester and septon and Old Nan seemed to think?\u0026nbsp; If I were truly a direwolf, I would understand the song, he thought wistfully. In his wolf dreams, he could race up the sides of mountains, jagged icy mountains taller than any tower, and stand at the summit beneath the full moon with all the world below him, the way it used to be.\u0026nbsp; “Oooo,” Bran cried tentatively. He cupped his hands around his mouth and lifted his head to the comet. “Ooooooooooooooooooo, ahooooooooooooooo,” he howled. it sounded stupid, high and hollow and quavering, a little boy’s howl, not a wolf’s. Yet Summer gave answer, his deep voice drowning out Bran’s thin one, and Shaggydog made it a chorus. Bran haroooed again. They howled together, last of their pack.\u0026nbsp; The noise brought a guard to his door, Hayhead with the wen on his nose. He peered in, saw Bran howling out the window, and said, “What’s this, my prince?”\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; It made Bran feel queer when they called him prince, though he was Robb’s heir, and Robb was King in the North now. He turned his head to howl at the guard. “Oooooooo. Oo-oo-oooooooooooo. “\u0026nbsp; Hayhead screwed up his face. “Now you stop that there.”\u0026nbsp; “0oo-0oo-0ooooo. 0oo-0oo-0oooooooooooooooo. “\u0026nbsp; The guardsman retreated. When he came back, Maester Luwin was with him, all in grey, his chain tight about his neck. “Bran, those beasts make sufficient noise without your help.” He crossed the room and put his hand on the boy’s brow. “The hour grows late, you ought to be fast asleep.”\u0026nbsp; “I’m talking to the wolves.” Bran brushed the hand away.\u0026nbsp; “Shall I have Hayhead carry you to your bed?”\u0026nbsp; “I can get to bed myself.” Mikken had hammered a row of iron bars into the wall, so Bran could pull himself about the room with his arms. It was slow and hard and it made his shoulders ache, but he hated being carried. “Anyway, I don’t have to sleep if I don’t want to.”\u0026nbsp; “All men must sleep, Bran. Even princes.”\u0026nbsp; “When I sleep I turn into a wolf.” Bran turned his face away and looked back out into the night. “Do wolves dream?”\u0026nbsp; “All creatures dream, I think, yet not as men do.”\u0026nbsp; “Do dead men dream?” Bran asked, thinking of his father. In the dark crypts below Winterfell, a stonemason was chiseling out his father’s likeness in granite.\u0026nbsp; “Some say yes, some no,” the maester answered. “The dead themselves are silent on the matter.”\u0026nbsp; “Do trees dream?”\u0026nbsp; “Trees? No...”\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1522/45433.html","bookId":1301,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 2:54:25 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 2:54:25 AM"}
