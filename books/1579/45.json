Even the horse, gazing at the cloud, starts to whinny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSissy takes two steps toward me. “What about the map?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe asks. I\u0027m surprised by the softness in her voice, how quiet she is despite the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It shows a boat to the north of us. Tied to a dock. If we can get there in time, there might be a chance.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you nuts? You can\u0027t trust that map. The Scientist was crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not to us. He seemed reasonable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stare north, in the direction of where the boat would be. “If the boat is real, why didn\u0027t he ever tel you about it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA frown creases her brow. “I don\u0027t know. But what I do know is that everything else in the map is accurate. The ridges, the mountains, everything is where it\u0027s depicted on the map. Even the boulders over there,” she says, pointing at them. “And so why not the boat?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head. “Look, even if it exists— and it doesn\u0027t— you\u0027l never get to it in time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027d rather die trying.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can\u0027t fl ee, we must stay and fi ght, I remind myself. The only chance of saving Ashley June is to fi ght back against the hunters. I raise my voice: “And I\u0027m tel ing you the only option for survival is to fi ght them head- on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEpap lurches forward. “C\u0027mon, Sissy. Let\u0027s go. Leave him here, already.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hepers aren\u0027t stupid. They know a doomed fi ght when they see one, they know their chances are better if they fl ee. I need to come up with a plan. One that will convince them to stay and fi ght. I stare at the hepers. Fear has shriveled their faces; they look tiny and vulnerable out here in the Vast, without the protection of the Dome around them. And then a thought occurs to me. The hunters don\u0027t even know I\u0027m with the hepers. They must think I\u0027m alone, separated from the hepers, a solo fugitive, and there\u0027s no reason for them to believe otherwise. And the smel of my blood, even across the miles of the Vast, now overpowers any trail of the hepers\u0027 odor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at the hepers, their weapons, the FLUNs. And at the boulders toppled atop one another, high and encaving. I blink. And there it is. A plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSissy steps forward, stands right in front of me with a look of curiosity. “What is it? You look like you thought of something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at them in turn, locking in on each pair of eyes for a few seconds. “Tuck tail, run away if you\u0027re too scared. But if you want to join me and fi ght back, I have a plan,” I fi nal y say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night merges with black. Not a speck of light in the skies, the stars hidden by gargantuan dark clouds shifting above, bloated continents of brooding darkness. The eastern mountains are gone, their once silhouetted borders breached by blackness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am alone. Sitting on the ground, leaning back on a boulder. In my hand is a spear that Sissy gave me right before she disappeared into the darkness. I place the tip of the spear against the palm of my hand and pause. It is al emptiness before me, the Vast stretched in an endless gray that is not quite black yet. Only the boulder I lean back on keeps me company. Its surface is cold and brittle against my back, but in this endless sea of aqueous darkness, its solidity is strangely consoling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI press the spear tip into my fl esh and slice downward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt leaves a smal slash, and only a dribble of blood trickles out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut for the hunters chasing me down, that is more than enough; it is a light house fl ashing in a sea of darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd only a few seconds later, the cry of hunger slices across the Vast. Already so close, so much louder, the intonations of desire heightened. They will be here soon, in less than a minute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fi st my hand and squeeze. More blood sluices out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnough now to overwhelm their olfactory senses; not a chance they will be distracted by any faint heper odor. I feel the pulse of blood against the cut, a push- push of seepage, oddly unsynchronized with the rapid, frightful beating of my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hepers left me with this spear and nothing else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA skittering sound, sand tossed harshly across the ground, whispery hisses lisp into my ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hunters have arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand up, my knees buckling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hazy fl ush of movement, darting from left to right. Then another in the opposite direction, just outside my cone of vision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree shapes emerge from the darkness, faintly at fi rst, then attain-ing defi nition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrimson Lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaunt Man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, solidifying out of the milky gray, two more shapes emerge, phantomlike at fi rst, then all too horrifyingly real.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFril y Dress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Director.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI expected only three of them, not fi ve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eall fi ve of them are gruesomely naked, SunBlock Lotion whipped over their bodies like buttercream frosting. Where the lotion has worn off, open sores gouge their skin like volcanic craters, glistening red raw even in the dark. The effects of a whole day in the library with sunlight pouring in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is their eyes that are the most chil ing, the naked anger bristling behind their eyebal s, raw hatred mixed with a pulsating lust for my blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aren\u0027t you a sight for sore eyes,” I say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey edge forward, snarling at me. Slowly, a few yards at a time, creeping toward me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething is wrong: this is not how I envisioned the scene would play out. They are much too control ed; an unbridled feeding frenzy was what I imagined, bodies soaring at me, fangs bared, a race to get me, to tear through me. That I would be ripped into a dozen different pieces within seconds. But this seems too methodical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did you not get your beauty sleep today?” I say. “Because you all look terrible.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey start to spread out in a wide arc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes are on all of them, but especial y the Director, directly in front of me. He is the calmest of the lot, his breathing steady, his feet stepping with fastidiousness on the desert gravel. His long left arm is dangling down, his nails delicately tapping his kneecap, his right arm kept strangely behind his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We\u0027ve decided to play a game,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do tel .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGaunt Man is on my far left, hunkering lower even as he continues to move down an imaginary arc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m trying to decide what to cal this game. The Sharing Game and the Savoring Game are probably the top contenders.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFril y Dress is rol ing on my right, slowly, like a guttered bowling bal , her eyes fi l ed with wet anticipation. Her mounds of fat lol downward off her body, like pregnant water droplets about to drip off. Her teeth are bared, a faint hiss sluicing out. She continues to rol right until she hits up against the boulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs does Gaunt Man on my left. Each of the hunters holds position; they look at the Director as if for further instructions. Then they edge closer, the circle shortening, tightening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See, we need to make an example of you,” the Director continues. “You\u0027ve made a mockery of the Hunt, of the Institution, of the Ruler. And of me. My reputation has been irreparably damaged. What kind of heper expert wouldn\u0027t be able to detect a heper right under his nose?” And for the fi rst time, his voice betrays emotion. A hitch. “It is not enough to simply devour you. That would be too quick— for us and for you. So, we have decided— my suggestion, of course— to share you, to savor you. Slowly. Luxuriantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne piece at a time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd still they inch forward, eyes swiveling back and forth, examining me, behind me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrimson Lips suddenly darts forward at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Stop!” the Director yel s, and Crimson Lips fal s into a frozen crouch, her body erect, like a startled cat. And for the fi rst time I see a FLUN in the Director\u0027s right hand, pointed at Crimson Lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt must be Ashley June\u0027s FLUN, the one left behind in the library.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrimson Lips retreats back into formation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s hard to play this game, sometimes our excitement can get the better of us.” He swivels his head about at each of the hunters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Proceed,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey creep closer, the circle enclosing, everyone staying in formation. Eyes constantly on the move, scrutinizing me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We will take you piece by piece, each of your limbs at a time,” the Director says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The two male hunters will rip off each of your arms, and the two ladies will rip off your legs, one by one. We\u0027l space it out, maybe fi ve minutes between limbs? We\u0027l be sure to keep you alive through it all . It will play out so wel for the book, see? Draw out this ending, really keep the readers on edge. A heart- thumping climax like no other.” He stares at me, his eyes glistening wetly over as if drooling. “Last to go will be me. I get your head.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Director leans back like a wolf howling at the night sky, scratching his wrist with rabid delirium. “Did you really say, ‘And then what?\u0027 What does it matter to you? You\u0027re dead!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pauses, studying me. “Oh, are you concerned about your heper buddies?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t you worry about them. We\u0027l get to them eventual y.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven in this large desert, we\u0027l fi nd them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey don\u0027t know where the other hepers are, I think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And then we go back to your girlfriend and tel her what we did to you!” Gaunt Man sneers, drool now leaking out of his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We will do that,” the Director cuts in, shooting a cold look at Gaunt Man with the irritated expression of a man deprived of the punch line he\u0027s been chomping at the bit to tel . “And, eventual y, we will do the same to her. Limb by limb. The Savoring Game. Oh, I quite like that name, actual y, I think that\u0027s the name that\u0027s going to stick.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe circle encloses on me even more. Their bodies percolate with ravenous excitement now, heads bobbing up and down, arms twitching at their side, weird nipping sounds escaping their lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who do you think will scream louder, you or her? She\u0027s got a lot of passion, that girl, so perhaps she\u0027l scream louder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then again, she\u0027s got quite a bit of spine, wouldn\u0027t you say, what with that stunt she pul ed? Not at all like you, running away like a squirrel and leaving her all by her lonesome.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunt-the-hunt-1/page-45.html","bookId":1579,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:33 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:33 AM"}
