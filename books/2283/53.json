Logan wanted him in on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a big decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the day they finished the show, he went out to his house alone. Out back, he stroked Kanga and Roo and talked to them. He told Johnny Bearclaw about the offer, and Johnny assured him that he’d stay at the Arizona ranch and care for it, no matter where Sloan might be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end he sat in his living room with Cougar on his lap. When he looked at the chair by the fire, he saw that his ancestor, Longman, was sitting with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What should I do, Longman?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Make your own decision,” Longman said. “You came here when you needed to come here. You can’t go back, but you can go forward. Maybe you came back for many reasons. But it’s time to bury the past, all of the past. And then, as men must, go where your heart leads you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled and leaned back. He still wasn’t convinced Longman was real. Longman had said what Sloan felt in his own mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the next few days, Jane finished the reconstructions of Sage’s skull and she did a quick job with Red Marston’s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted a quiet service for the two of them, but the whole town showed up at the chapel by the cemetery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dead were put to rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lingered when the others left the graveyard; Jane stayed with him. She’d never once tried to influence him to accept Logan’s offer, but they were together every night—as if they’d always be together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe squeezed his hand suddenly. “Sloan. There they are.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked up. The day was dying; red streaked a darkening sky. But he could make out three forms and they slowly became clearer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed Marston, Trey Hardy and Sage McCormick. He stood and Jane rose with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne figure broke away. It was Sage. She moved among the wooden crosses and the occasional stone marker to reach them. She set a hand on his face. He felt it, like the caress of a soft and gentle fog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she turned away and rejoined the others. They started walking into the darkness as the sun fell lower and lower.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone else was walking toward the three friends, someone who seemed to shimmer with light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your great-great grandfather?” Jane whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Maybe,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen they were all gone. Neither he nor Jane spoke as they left the cemetery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s beautiful land in Virginia,” she told him. “Not far from Arlington. Beautiful horse ranches, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Virginia. There’s a lot of horse country there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, there is. And cats are happy just about anywhere.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. “Home is where the heart is, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe whirled her around and kissed her as the red drained from the sky and soft shadows surrounded them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled, because she looked at him a little anxiously when they separated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I’m going to be a fed,” he mused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’ll make you go through the academy,” she warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, they taught you to shoot!” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They did.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kissed her again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When do we leave?” he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with those words, she threw her arms around him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-night-is-watching-krewe-of-hunters-9/page-53.html","bookId":2283,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:46:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:46:53 PM"}
