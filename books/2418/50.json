She had her legs crossed at the ankles, the tips of her loafers tapping the air with the music. \"Should I thank you, or apologize for inflicting myself on you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No apologies,\" I assured her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My problems almost got you killed, Tres.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Technically speaking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now I feel like I\u0027ve been adopted. You and Erainya, George and Kelly, your other friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s an odd family,\" I admitted. \"But our weirdness makes us strong. You\u0027ll fit right in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe slapped my knee. \"How can I thank you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Feed Robert Johnson every day?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guess again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled. Jem and Michael trotted over to us and plopped down on the grass, still counting their winnings. Jem appropriated my peppermint lemon and told me he was going to like this school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe junior high band\u0027s waltz kept going. A daddy in a three-piece suit was now dancing with his little girl on his toes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt looked like fun. \"How about this dance?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInes smiled radiantly. \"That\u0027s what you want as a thank-you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s one of the things on my wish list, yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichael let out a giggle, then caught himself. His mother looked at him, amazed. His ears turned bright red. She looked back at me and her eyes grew suspicious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the joke?\" she demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to dance or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A dance.
