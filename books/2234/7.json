Once the area had been a tightly sealed back door to the Soviet Union, guarded by masses of troops. Now the borders were open. Unrestricted transportation and trade. China had been one of the first to formally recognize the Federation, and treaties between the two nations assured that travel and commerce flowed freely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXinyang province constituted sixteen percent of China. Mostly mountains and desert, loaded with natural resources. Wholly different from the rest of the country. Less communism. Heavy Islam. Once called East Turkestan, its identity was traceable far more to central Asia than the Middle Kingdom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Venetian League had been instrumental in formalizing friendly relations with the Chinese, another reason she\u0027d chosen to join the group. The Great Western Economic Expansion began five years ago, when Beijing started pouring billions into infrastructure and redevelopment all across Xinyang. League members had received many of the contracts for petrochemicals, mining, machine works, road improvements, and construction. Its friends in the Chinese capital were many, as money spoke as loudly in the communist world as anywhere else, and she\u0027d used those connections to her maximum political advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flight from Samarkand was a little over an hour in the high-speed chopper. She\u0027d made the trek many times and, as always, stared below at the rough terrain, imagining the ancient caravans that once made their way east and west along its famed Silk Road. Jade, coral, linens, glass, gold, iron, garlic, tea-even dwarfs, nubile women, and horses so fierce they were said to have sweated blood-were all traded. Alexander the Great never made it this far east, but Marco Polo had definitely walked that earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead, she spotted Kashgar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe city sat on the edge of the Taklimakan Desert, a hundred and twenty kilometers east from the Federation border, within the shadows of the snowy Pamirs, some of the highest and most barren mountains in the world. A bejeweled oasis, China \u0027s western-most metropolis, it had existed, like Samarkand, for over two thousand years. Once a place of bustling open markets and crowded bazaars, now it was consumed by dust, wails, and the falsetto cries of muezzins summoning men to prayer in its four thousand mosques. Three hundred and fifty thousand people lived among its hotels, warehouses, businesses, and shrines. The town walls were long gone and a superhighway, another part of the great economic expansion, now encircled and directed green taxis in all directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe helicopter banked north where the landscape buckled. The desert was not far to the east. Taklimakan literally meant \"go in and you won\u0027t come out.\" An apt description for a place with winds so hot they could, and did, kill entire caravans within minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe spotted their destination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA black-glass building in the center of a rock-strewn meadow, the beginnings of a forest a half kilometer behind. Nothing identified the two-story structure, which she knew was owned by Philogen Pharmaceutique, a Luxembourg corporation headquartered in Italy, its largest shareholder an American expatriate with the quite Italian name of Enrico Vincenti.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly on, she\u0027d made a point to learn Vincenti\u0027s personal history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was a virologist, hired by the Iraqis in the 1970s as part of a biological weapons program that the then new leader, Saddam Hussein, wanted to pursue. Hussein had viewed the Biological Toxin Weapons Convention of 1972, which banned germ warfare worldwide, as nothing more than an opportunity. Vincenti had worked with the Iraqis until just before the first Gulf War, when Hussein quickly disbanded the research. Peace brought UN inspectors, which forced a near permanent abandonment. So Vincenti moved on, starting a pharmaceutical company that expanded at a record pace during the 1990s. Now it was the largest in Europe, with an impressive array of patents. A huge multinational conglomerate. Quite an achievement for an unheralded mercenary scientist. Which had long made her wonder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe chopper landed and she hustled inside the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe exterior glass walls were merely a facade. Like tables nestled together, another whole structure rose inside. A polished-slate walkway encircled the inner building and bushy indoor plants lined both sides of the walk. The inside stone walls were broken by three sets of double doors. She knew the unique arrangement was a way to quietly ensure security. No external hedgerows topped with strands of barbed wire. No outside guards. No cameras. Nothing to alert anyone that the building was anything special.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crossed the outer perimeter and approached one of the entrances, her path blocked by a metal gate. A security guard stood behind a marble counter. The gate was controlled by a hand scanner, but she was not required to stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other side stood an impish man in his late fifties with thinning gray hair and a mousy face. Wire-framed glasses shielded expressionless eyes. He was dressed in a black-and-gold lab coat unbuttoned in the front, a security badge labeled \"Grant Lyndsey\" clipped to his lapel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Welcome, Minister,\" he said in English.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe answered his greeting with a look meant to signal annoyance. His e-mail had suggested urgency, and though she\u0027d not liked anything about the summons, she\u0027d canceled her afternoon activities and come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey entered the inner building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond the main entrance the path forked. Lyndsey turned left and led her through a maze of windowless corridors. Everything was hospital clean and smelled of chlorine. All of the doors were equipped with electronic locks. At the one labeled \"Chief Scientist,\" Lyndsey unclipped the ID on his lapel and slid the card through a slot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eModern decor dominated the windowless office. Each time she visited the same thing struck her as odd. No family pictures. No diplomas on the wall. No mementos. As if this man possessed no life. Which was probably not far from the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to show you something,\" Lyndsey said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spoke to her as an equal, and that she despised. His tone always clear that he lived in China and was not subject to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe flicked on a monitor that, from a ceiling-mounted camera, displayed a middle-aged woman perched in a chair watching television. She knew the room was on the building\u0027s second floor, in the patient ward, as she\u0027d seen images from there before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Last week,\" Lyndsey said, \"I requisitioned a dozen from the prison. Like we\u0027ve done before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d been unaware that another clinical trial had been performed. \"Why wasn\u0027t I told?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know I was required to tell you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard what he\u0027d not said. Vincenti\u0027s in charge. His lab, his people, his concoctions. She\u0027d lied to Enver earlier. She\u0027d not cured him. Vincenti had. A technician from this lab had administered the antiagent. Though she possessed the biological pathogens, Vincenti controlled the remedies. A check and balance born of mistrust, in place from the beginning to ensure that their bargaining positions remained equal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLyndsey pointed a remote control and the screen changed to other patient rooms, eight in all, each occupied by a man or woman. Unlike the first, these patients lay supine, connected to intravenous drips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slipped off his glasses. \"I used only twelve, since they were readily available on short notice. I needed a quick study on the antiagent for the new virus. What I told you about a month ago. A nasty little thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And where did you find it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a species of rodent east of here in Heilongjiang province. We\u0027d heard tales of how people became sick after eating the things. Sure enough, there\u0027s a complex virus floating around in the rat blood. With a little tweaking, this bugger has punch. Death in less than one day.\" He pointed to the screen. \"Here\u0027s the proof.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d actually asked for a more offensive agent. Something that worked even faster than the twenty-eight she already possessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re all on life support. They\u0027ve been clinically dead for days. I need autopsies to verify the infectious parameters, but I wanted to show you before we sliced them up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the antiagent?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One dosage and all twelve were on their way to good health. Total reversal in a matter of hours. Then I substituted a placebo to all of them, except the first woman. She\u0027s the control. As expected, the others lapsed quickly and died.\" He brought the image on the screen back to the first woman. \"But she\u0027s virus free. Perfectly normal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why was this trial needed?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wanted a new virus. I needed to see if the adjustments worked.\" Lyndsey threw her a smile. \"And, like I said, I had to verify the antiagent.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When do I get the new virus?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can take it today. That\u0027s why I called.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe never liked transporting the viruses, but only she knew this lab\u0027s location. Her deal was with Vincenti. A personal arrangement between them. No way she could trust anyone with the fruits of that bargain. And her helicopter would never be stopped by the Chinese.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get the virus ready,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All frozen and packed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pointed at the screen. \"What about her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"She\u0027ll be reinfected. Dead by tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer nerves were still on edge. Trampling the would-be assassin had vented some of her frustration, but unanswered questions remained about the murder attempt. How had Vincenti known? Perhaps because he\u0027d ordered it? Hard to say. But she\u0027d been caught off guard. Vincenti had been a step ahead of her. And that she did not like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNor did she like Lindsey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pointed at the screen. \"Have her ready to leave, too. Immediately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that wise?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my concern.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"Some amusement?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you like to come along and see?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, thanks. I like it here, on the Chinese side of the border.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rose. \"And if I were you, I\u0027d stay here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNINETEEN\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDENMARK\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMALONE KEPT HIS GUN READY AS THORVALDSEN CONCLUDED HIS business with Viktor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can make the exchange back here,\" Thorvaldsen said. \"Tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t strike me as a man who requires money,\" Viktor said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Actually, I like as much as I can acquire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone repressed a smile. His Danish friend actually gave away millions of euros to causes all around the world. He\u0027d often wondered if he was one of those causes, since Thorvaldsen had made a point, two years ago, to travel to Atlanta and offer him a chance to change his life in Copenhagen. An opportunity he\u0027d taken and never regretted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m curious,\" Viktor said. \"The quality of the forgery was remarkable. Who\u0027s the craftsman?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A person of talent, who takes pride in his work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pass on my compliments.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some of your euros will go that way.\" Thorvaldsen paused. \"Now I have a question. Are you going after the last two medallions, here in Europe?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the third one, in Samarkand?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViktor did not reply, but Thorvaldsen\u0027s message had surely been received. I know your business well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViktor started to leave. \"I\u0027ll call tomorrow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen stayed seated as the man left the room. \"Look forward to hearing from you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front door opened, then closed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cotton,\" Thorvaldsen said, producing a paper bag from his pocket. \"We have little time. Carefully, slide the case with the medallion into this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe understood. \"Fingerprints? That\u0027s why you gave him the coin.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You saw how he touched nothing. But he had to hold the medallion so he could switch them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone used the barrel of the gun to slide the plastic case into the bag, careful that it landed flat. He rolled the top closed, leaving an air pocket. He knew the drill. Unlike on television, paper, not plastic, was the best repository for fingerprint evidence. Far less chance of smearing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen stood. \"Come, now.\" He watched as his friend shuffled across the room, head cocked forward. \"We must hurry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe noticed Thorvaldsen was moving toward the rear of the house. \"Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Out of here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hustled after his friend and they left through a kitchen door that opened onto a railed deck, facing the sea. Fifty yards away, a dock jutted from the rocky shoreline where a motorboat waited. The morning sky had turned overcast. Gunmetal gray clouds now hung low. A brisk northern wind cascaded across the sound, swirling the frothy brown water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re leaving?\" he asked, as Thorvaldsen stepped from the deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Dane continued to move with surprising speed for a man with a crooked spine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Cassiopeia?\" Malone asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In trouble,\" Thorvaldsen said. \"But that\u0027s our only saving grace.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCASSIOPEIA WATCHED AS THE MAN FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE climbed into his rental car and sped back down the tree-lined lane that led to the highway. She switched on a handheld LCD monitor, linked by radio with two video cameras she\u0027d installed the previous week-one at the highway entrance, the other mounted high in a tree fifty meters from the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the tiny screen the car stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTire Slasher scampered from the woods. The driver opened his door and stepped out. Both men hustled a few meters back down the lane toward the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew exactly what they were waiting for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo she switched off the display and rushed from her hiding place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVIKTOR WAITED TO SEE IF HE WAS RIGHT. HE\u0027D PARKED THE CAR just past a bend in the hard-packed lane and watched the house from behind a tree trunk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re not going anywhere,\" Rafael said. \"Two flat tires.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViktor knew the woman had to have been watching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I never let on,\" Rafael said. \"I acted like I was on guard and sensed nothing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich was what Viktor had told his partner to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom his pocket he removed the medallion that he\u0027d managed to steal. Minister Zovastina\u0027s orders were clear. Retrieve and return all of them intact. Five were accounted for. Only three remained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were they like?\" Rafael asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Puzzling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he meant it. He\u0027d anticipated their moves, almost too well, and that bothered him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same slender woman with lioness moves emerged from the woods. Surely she\u0027d seen the tires slashed and was racing to report to her compatriots. He was pleased to know that he\u0027d been right. But why had she not stopped the assault? Maybe her task was simply to watch? He noticed she was carrying something. Small and rectangular. He wished he\u0027d brought binoculars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRafael reached into his jacket pocket and removed the radio controller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gently laid a hand on his partner\u0027s arm. \"Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman stopped and examined the tires, then trotted toward the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give her time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree hours ago, after arranging the meeting, they\u0027d driven straight here. A thorough reconnaissance had confirmed that the house stood empty, so they\u0027d stashed packs of Greek fire beneath the raised foundation and inside the attic. Instead of one of the turtles igniting this mixture, they\u0027d rigged a radio charge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman disappeared inside the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eViktor silently counted to ten and prepared to lift his hand from Rafael\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMALONE STOOD IN THE BOAT. THORVALDSEN BESIDE HIM.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you mean Cassiopeia is in trouble?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The house is loaded with Greek fire. They came before us and prepared. Now that he has the medallion, Viktor doesn\u0027t intend for us to survive the meeting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And they\u0027re waiting to make sure Cassiopeia is in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my estimate. But we\u0027re about to see if it\u0027s also theirs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCASSIOPEIA ALLOWED THE FRONT DOOR TO CLOSE, THEN RACED through the house. This was chancy. She could only hope that the thieves gave her a few seconds before they detonated the mixture. Her nerves were tingling, her mind surging, her melancholy replaced with an adrenaline-driven rush.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the museum, Malone had sensed her anxiety, seemingly knowing that something was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut at the moment she couldn\u0027t worry about it. Enough emotion had been expended on things she could not change. Right now, finding the rear door was all that mattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe burst out into dull daylight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalone and Thorvaldsen waited in the boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house blocked any view of their escape from down the lane in front. She still held the compact LCD monitor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSixty meters to the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaped from the wooden deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMALONE SPOTTED CASSIOPEIA AS SHE FLED FROM THE HOUSE AND ran straight for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFifty feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA massive swoosh and the house suddenly caught fire. One second it stood intact, the next flames poured from the windows, out from beneath, and stretched skyward through the roof. Like magician\u0027s flash paper, he thought. No explosion. Instant combustion. Total. Complete. And, in the absence of salt water, unstoppable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassiopeia found the dock and leaped into the boat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You cut that close,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get down,\" she urged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey crouched in the boat and he watched as she adjusted a video receiver and the image of a car appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo men climbed inside. He recognized Viktor. The car drove away, disappearing from the screen. She flicked a switch and another image showed the car turning onto the highway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen seemed pleased. \"Apparently, our ruse worked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t you think you could have told me what was happening?\" Malone asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCassiopeia threw him a mischievous grin. \"Now what fun would that have been?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He has the medallion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which is precisely what we wanted him to have,\" Thorvaldsen said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house continued to consume itself. Smoke billowed into the sky. Cassiopeia cranked the outboard and steered the boat out into open water. Thorvaldsen\u0027s seaside estate lay only a few miles to the north.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had the boat delivered just after we arrived,\" Thorvaldsen said, as he grabbed Malone by the arm and led him to the stern. Cold salt spray misted over the bow. \"I appreciate you being here. We were going to ask for your help today, after the museum was destroyed. That\u0027s why she wanted to meet with you. She needs your help, but I doubt she\u0027ll ask now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to inquire further, but knew now was not the time. His answer, though, was never in doubt. \"She\u0027s got it.\" He paused. \"You\u0027ve both got it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThorvaldsen squeezed his arm in appreciation.

But now we have hope.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-venetian-betrayal-cotton-malone-3/page-7.html","bookId":2234,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:15:26 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:15:26 PM"}
