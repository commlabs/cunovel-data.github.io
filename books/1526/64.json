Bad time to be playing a video game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNob\u0027cobi signaled them to be quiet and waved Harry next to him. He whispered something in his ear. Harry grimaced and backed next to Ben. In a hushed voice, he translated. \"This is where Nob\u0027cobi spotted Tiny Tim. The music came from just around the next collapsed building.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen nodded. This time he made sure he placed each foot on solid rock before proceeding. He didn\u0027t want to repeat the previous blunder that had attracted the pod\u0027s attention. The group crept silently, edging past a demolished mess tent, its pots and pans strewn across the rocky floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a minute of creeping, the now-familiar sound of claw on rock and snuffling of something large could be heard from up ahead. Nob\u0027cobi, who was a few yards in front of Ben and Harry, peered around the edge of a pile of shredded lumber into the clearing beyond. Suddenly, he popped back, flattening himself against the corner. He signaled them to freeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen watched as the beast\u0027s thick tail swung into view ahead, sweeping aside a few stray pots. Their clattering was painfully loud in the silence of the dead camp. The tail then disappeared from view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNob\u0027cobi waved them slowly forward. Ben crept up first and inched just enough around the corner to peer into the clearing ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIts back was to him, tail slashing back and forth. He could see its head flicking from left to right as it examined something in front of it, snorting loudly. Then it shuffled to the side to get another vantage in which to examine its prey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen suppressed a gasp. As the large creature moved, it revealed its intended target. Jason was roped to one of the columns, the boy\u0027s eyes wide with terror. But the crak\u0027an just circled around the column, snorting and snuffling, obviously baffled as to why its prey wasn\u0027t running. Like a cat, Ben thought, it wasn\u0027t used to a meal just sitting there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen slipped back around and allowed Harry a peek before speaking. He whispered in Harry\u0027s ear. \"I need you to lure the bastard away. Like you did the others. Give me a chance to free Jason and get him to safety. We\u0027ll meet back at Blakely\u0027s office.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But be careful,\" Ben warned. \"This bastard\u0027s a tricky one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry huddled a moment with Nob\u0027cobi. Then the two slipped away to circle east a bit, to draw its attention away from Ben\u0027s hiding place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen waited as they maneuvered into position, holding his breath, praying that he wouldn\u0027t all of a sudden hear a scream from Jason. The creature wouldn\u0027t wait forever. Eventually the novelty would wear thin and it would attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTensed, muscles quivering with anticipation, Ben jumped at the sudden eruption of clanking pots and pans from just east of his position. Harry and Nob\u0027cobi. It was about time. He risked peeking around the corner to see the commotion\u0027s effect on the crak\u0027an.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt stood there frozen, its ears cocked back to listen, then slowly swung its head in the direction of the noise. It took a few steps toward the sound, then stopped and glanced back at Jason strapped to the pillar. It wasn\u0027t going to take the bait. At least not before nailing its easy prey. It took a step back toward Jason.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoddamn you! Ben raised his pistol. Before Ben could shoot, Harry jumped into the clearing with two dented pots in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hollered at it. \"Hey there, big fellow, how about a little action?\" To punctuate his statement, he slammed the pots together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe voice and clank got its attention. With a roar, it swung back in Harry\u0027s direction. The quickness of the beast seemed to catch Harry off guard. He stumbled a step backward, almost falling. Ben clenched his teeth. Move it, soldier! Harry seemed to hear his silent command and dashed back into the alley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fleeing man was too much temptation for the monster. It scrabbled after Harry, disappearing down the alley.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen didn\u0027t wait. As soon as the tip of its tail vanished, he dashed into the clearing. Toward the boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears trailed down Jason\u0027s soot-blackened features. The boy still stared in the direction of the disappearing beast. Thank god he seemed otherwise unharmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen ran toward him. The scuffing of Ben\u0027s boots on rock drew Jason\u0027s attention. A fleeting look of terror crossed his features before he seemed to recognize Ben. Then fresh tears flowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen reached him in seconds. He hugged him hard in the ropes, pulling the gag free, wondering who the hell had bound and gagged the boy. But now wasn\u0027t the time for questions. Jason shook with sobs. \"You\u0027re okay now, son. You\u0027re safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Jason kept on sobbing, trying to get words out between choking sobs. \"I… tried to… tried to call you… with my game.\" He dropped the toy still held in his hands, and it clattered to the stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You did good.\" Ben crouched down, pulled out a knife, and attacked the ropes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My… my mom… is she okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s fine. She\u0027s somewhere safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, Jason jerked in the loosening ropes. Ben could barely get the boy\u0027s hands untied with him squirming so much. He finally succeeded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay still for a sec. Let me get that last rope from around you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to see!\" Jason seemed frantic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason lifted up his untucked shirt. For the first time, Ben noticed the glowing LED readout on Jason\u0027s belt buckle. The number 6 glowed back at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason looked down, then moaned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a bomb,\" he said, a desperate look in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason pointed out the gray squares of plastique hooked to the belt. \"Khalid put it on me. To control Linda. It\u0027s set to go off in six minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let\u0027s get it off you.\" He reached for the boy with the knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason backed away. \"If it\u0027s removed, it\u0027ll go off. Only the secret code will release it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who knows the code?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Khalid… and he\u0027s out there somewhere setting other bombs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goddamn bastard. If I get my hands on him… \"Well, there\u0027s got to be a way to disarm it. Maybe Harry… he\u0027s a demolitions expert.\" Ben covered his face with his hands. Bloody hell. How was he going to get him back here in time? They weren\u0027t supposed to rendezvous back at Blakely\u0027s office for another half hour. He clenched his fists and pressed them against his temple. Goddamn it man, think!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBen stared as the LED number dissolved from a 6 to a 5.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley plopped down on the pillow in her small cave. Once again she was confined to her cell. Three guards stood at the threshold, diamond blades glinting in the fungal glow. She had tried through both pantomime and repeating Sin\u0027jari\u0027s name to communicate her innocence in the attack on Mo\u0027amba, but it was futile. Her only witness, Mo\u0027amba, was near death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA commotion at the entrance to her cell drew her attention. She watched as Michaelson was shoved past the guards. He stumbled on his weak ankle but caught his balance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuckers took my guns,\" he said as he crossed over to her. \"All of them. What\u0027s going on?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry, it was my fault,\" she said, standing up, her muscles still tense with frustration. \"I was at the wrong place at the wrong time.\" She told him the story of Sin\u0027jari\u0027s attack on Mo\u0027amba, and the result of her interference. \"I was caught with a smoking gun, so to speak. Mo\u0027amba was found stabbed in the chest with me standing over him, the murder weapon in my hand. Can you blame them?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s going to happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know. I think everyone\u0027s more concerned about Mo\u0027amba at the moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you think the old guy has any chance of surviving?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley shook her head. \"Doubtful. He lost a lot of blood. And with his mental abilities, if he was able, he\u0027d be blowing the whistle on Sin\u0027jari himself-telepathically on all wavelengths. For him to be remaining so silent, he\u0027s got to be nearly brain-dead. And if he dies, I don\u0027t think either one of us has much chance of living, regardless of whether or not Ben makes the deadline.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMichaelson glanced at his watch. \"Ben has less than eight hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSighing, she said, \"Now I\u0027m hoping he doesn\u0027t return. As angry as those tribesmen are, I think even if he returns with the statue, they\u0027ll just execute him along with us. It\u0027d be best if he just stays away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" She sat back down on a pillow and waved Michaelson to do the same. \"If only there was a way to warn him. To tell Harry and Ben not to come back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no way. Come hell or high water, Ben will return for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smacked her knee with a fist. \"Then I\u0027ve got to find some way to let the village know about Sin\u0027jari. Some way to communicate. But they won\u0027t even try to listen. Their judgment is too clouded with anger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe Harry will return with Ben before Mo\u0027amba dies. He could translate your story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even if he did, do you think they\u0027d believe us? Sin\u0027jari is one of their elders. It would be his word against mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we\u0027ll need evidence. What do you think the bastard was up to anyway?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No good, that\u0027s for sure. I think he means to interfere with Ben\u0027s mission. Thwart it in some way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If we could prove that, then that would go a long way to support your claim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But how?\" she asked, exasperated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Catch him red-handed when he returns. The only easy route back to the village from Alpha Cavern is through that wormhole. If he went up that way, he\u0027ll sneak back that way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And how do you propose to catch him locked up in this cell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"Hey, I don\u0027t have all the answers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head at the uselessness of their reverie. \"Still, this all depends on Mo\u0027amba surviving until Ben and Harry return. If he should-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA keening wail erupted from the guards at the door. A cry that also echoed from the village around them, piercing the stone walls like paper, the pitch so high it caused the hairs to stand on Ashley\u0027s arms. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/subterranean/page-64.html","bookId":1526,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:30:23 PM"}
