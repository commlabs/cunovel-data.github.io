How Siegfried went to the Niblung Land for his Knights","content":"\u0026nbsp;So thence to the strand and the haven Siegfried hied him away \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the Hood of Darkness shrouded. Now a boat by the wharf-side lay,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And thereinto from men’s eyes hidden stepped Siegfried Siegmund’s son,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he thrust it forth o’er the waters, as it were by a wind driven on.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 66}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Now no one beheld that steersman, though swift was the barge’s flight\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Sped on by the strength of Siegfried, so passing-great was his might.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Who marked it, deemed that it drifted before a strange strong wind:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n None dreamed it was driven of Siegfried the child of Siegelind.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the space of that day and the night-tide that followed was he brought\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To a certain land, by the mighty strength wherewithal he wrought.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was leagues full three-and-thirty, yea, more peradventure, away.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This was the Land of the Niblungs, where he won the Hoard for a prey.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Alone stepped forth the hero on to an eyot wide;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he fastened, that knight resourceful, the boat to the river-side.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then he passed unto where a castle stood on a craggy bent,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And therein sought harbourage, even as a wayfarer toil-forspent.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So he came before that burg-gate: fast locked and barred did it stand;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For jealous aye for their honour were the warders of that land.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On the massy door ’neath the gate-tower did the unknown one begin\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Straightway to beat, and his smiting roused up therewithin\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A mighty one and a giant, that there kept watch and ward,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And night and day beside him his armour lay and his sword:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he spake: “Who knocketh so roughly on the burg-gate therewithout?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In a feigned voice Siegfried the valiant sent back the answering shout:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Up! I am a knight belated. Knave, open to me forthright,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Else I with strokes heavy-handed shall gall a laggard wight\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Who loveth to keep his chamber and lie in the sluggard’s bed!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then exceeding wroth was the warder for the word that Siegfried said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n His armour hath that fierce giant in haste on his huge limbs done,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And his helmet hath he settled on his head, that mighty one.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In haste hath he snatched his buckler and the castle gate swung wide:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In a fury of rage against Siegfried forth did he swiftly stride.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “How dar’st thou wake,” he shouted, “all these of our gallant band?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then fell fast-raining buffets, dealt by his mighty hand:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n From the shield of the noble stranger glanced fierce blows many and rude,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet the steel shards flew from his shield-rim as the giant warder hewed\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 67}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With a massy mace of iron, that the thane was hard-bestead.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Well-nigh began the hero the very death to dread\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At the smiting of that huge porter, as the lightning vehement.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet was his liege-lord Siegfried with his faithfulness well content.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So furious was their battling, the keep rang echoing round,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And afar in the hall of King Niblung was heard the tempest-sound:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yet at last he o’ermastered the warder, and bound him foot and hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n —Ere long men laughed at the story through all the Niblung land.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As the thunder of that conflict through the mountain’s heart far rolled,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It was heard of the Dwarf, the dauntless Albrich, the tameless-souled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In haste he armed him, and thither he ran, and behold, he found\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That noble stranger-warrior, and the giant warder bound.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of fiery mood was Albrich, and mighty strength he had:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In hauberk-rings and in helmet was his body for battle clad;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And a morning-star huge-headed of gold had he gripped in his hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With swift feet rushed he onward unto where did Siegfried stand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Seven balls spike-studded and massy by chains from the mace-head swung,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wherewith on the shield that the hero’s arm before him flung\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He hailed down blows so bitter that in fragments all it flew,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So that somewhat adread that noble guest for his own life grew.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The shield by that flail of battle shattered he flung from his hand,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he thrust back into the scabbard Balmung, the long keen brand:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He would smite not therewith, lest his faithful seneschal should die;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For aye was he noble-hearted, and the flower of chivalry.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But the hero leapt upon Albrich with his strong bare hands alone,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And fast by the beard he gripped him, that hoary-headed one,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he mightily plucked, that the Earth-dwarf shrieked for very pain,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As the hero-knight tamed Albrich with his fingers’ bitter strain.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Loud cried the erstwhile aweless: “Ah, leave my life unto me!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Had I not to another hero sworn true fealty,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And bowed myself in homage to be vassal to him for aye,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Thee would I serve to my death-day,” did the crafty-wise one say.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 68}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then bound he Albrich, even as he bound that giant before:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of a truth the prowess of Siegfried galled him exceeding sore!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then asked the Dwarf of the hero: “I pray thee, how named art thou?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he answered: “My name is Siegfried: thou hast heard that name, I trow.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Spake Albrich: “For these tidings of a truth mine heart is fain!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of thy strength, the strength of a hero, hast thou given proof again,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hast shown how well thou art worthy to be lord of the Niblung Land.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So thou spare me for that I withstood thee, will I do all thy command.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Answered the good knight Siegfried: “Up then, and speedily\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Bring thou unto me my bravest which here in the fortress be,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n A thousand Niblungs: before me now would I see them brought.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But the cause for the which he desired them thus, he told him not.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then Albrich and the giant from their bonds the hero unbound;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the Dwarf to the place ran swiftly where the Niblung knights slept sound;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And in eager haste he uproused them, the men of the Niblung array,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Crying, “Up, ye heroes! to Siegfried your lord must ye go straightway.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Upsprang they from their couches, and they clad themselves with speed;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And a thousand eager warriors stood arrayed in battle-weed;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he led them to where Prince Siegfried abode them in that great hall;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And they gave to him loving greeting by word and by deed withal.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n They have kindled a hundred torches, they have poured the wine for their lord;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And for that their speedy coming he thanked them with gracious word;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he said to them: “Now shall ye follow with me far hence oversea.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And those valiant knights and loyal consented willingly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Stout vassal-knights three thousand had gathered at his call,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And of these he chose a thousand, the goodliest of them all;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And their helmets were brought to the chosen, and all their harness of war,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Forasmuch as their lord would lead them unto Brunhild’s land afar.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he spake: “O knights true-hearted, I would say unto you this thing:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ye must take rich raiment for wearing in the presence of Queen and King;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 69}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For there shall ye look upon many a maiden fair to see:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Therefore ye needs must adorn you with seemly bravery.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (C) Now perchance might a simple-one chide me—“Not sooth is this thy song!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How might in the castle be gathered so vast a knightly throng?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wherewithal should all these be nourished, and whence purvey them attire?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Though realms he had thirty, never had he brought to pass his desire.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n (C) Tush!—surely ye know this—Siegfried was a passing-wealthy lord:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He had that realm in possession, and his was the Niblung Hoard.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So he gave to his war-thanes freely so much as they lacked, nay, more.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How much he lavished soever, unminished still was his store.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lo, in the dimness of dawning forth on the sea they fare:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n —Ho for the eager warriors that Siegfried had gathered there!—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With goodly battle-horses and lordly attire sailed they:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So unto the land of Brunhild they came, a knightly array.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n On her battlements many a fair one stood gazing over the sea.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then spake that Daughter of Princes: “Knoweth any man who they be\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Whom yonder I see far fleeting o’er the waters in gallant show?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How rich be the sails that waft them!—they be whiter than driven snow!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then spake the Lord of Rhineland: “My royal train be these\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Whom I left as I journeyed hither not far behind overseas.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I have sent to speed them hither: lo, now be they come, O Queen.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With wondering eyes the coming of those knightly guests was seen.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Men saw on a ship’s prow Siegfried standing foremost of all\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In princely vesture: beside him was many a warrior tall.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then spake that Daughter of Princes: “Lord King, I pray thee, declare:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Shall I greet these guests at their coming, or shall I from greeting forbear?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He said: “Thou shalt go to meet them with welcome in thy face\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Forth of thy palace-portals, that none may doubt of thy grace.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So did that Daughter of Princes according as Gunther bade:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But cold and haughty greeting from Brunhild Siegfried had.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So they gave them lodging, and safely laid by their battle-gear.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And by this were guests so many there gathered from far and near,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 70}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That for these too strait was the city as they thronged on every hand.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And now would the valiant heroes fare home to Burgundia-land.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then spake that Daughter of Princes: “Unto him were I thankful-souled\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Who for me would deal out my bounty of my silver and my gold\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Unto my guests and King Gunther’s; for full is my treasury.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then Dankwart, Giselher’s liegeman, made answer gallantly:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “O noble Daughter of Princes, unto me commit the key,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And I will deal forth thy treasure,” said the valiant thane, “for thee.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If any cry out on the niggard, on me be all blame thrown!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n —That Dankwart was open-handed, full soon was to all men known.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When to Hagen’s brother committed was the key of her treasury,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The hand of the hero scattered rich gifts all lavishly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Who craved but one mark only, on him was so much showered\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That the poor of the land through their life-days might aye live gladness-dowered.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Pounds of silver uncounted by hundreds lavished he;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And forth of her halls passed many in goodly bravery\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Who never before in their life-tide clad in such splendour went.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But when Queen Brunhild heard it, was she passing ill-content.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n She arose and she spake unto Gunther the King: “I dare well say\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That nought is like to be left me of all my fair array\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Through your chamberlain’s reckless dealing:
