Getting him to attend can only be to the betterment of all concerned.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonique was confident. “I’m assured he will come. As will Lord Dingleproops. Of course, we can’t have young Vullrink, not after last night’s supper. Imagine using a knife for fish? And Mr. Plumleigh-Teignmott is right out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreshea nodded sagely. “Too young?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Too ill connected.” Monique looked pointedly at Dimity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimity glanced up from her needles. “He’ll only thank you for it. Pillover hates parties.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, wonderful. It’s always so nice to know the unwelcome are also uncaring of their social standing,” sneered Monique. She probably would have gone on with her commentary until their next lesson, but the perimeter alarm trumpeted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimity put down her knitting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girls stayed in their parlor, as they had been instructed. Even Sophronia, who was inclined to take to the hull to investigate, remained seated. With all the manufactured fog it would be impossible to see who approached, a fact that was worrying in and of itself. If someone had managed to spot and attack the school despite their cloud disguise, that someone had superior technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey waited with bated breath for the ship to shake with cannon fire, for the fateful lean and sway of a balloon collapsing. Nothing happened. They listened for the sound of timber splitting. Still nothing. In short order, the trumpeting stopped with no apparent reaction from ship, mechanicals, or staff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Must have been a false alarm,” said Dimity into the ensuing silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girls, with nothing better to do, prepared for their next lesson. Even Monique was sobered by the strange experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had foreign languages and lipreading with Lady Linette next. None of the boys were present. Apparently, gentlemen didn’t require foreign tongues. They moved from there on to tea and subterfuge with Mademoiselle Geraldine. Since the headmistress had no idea of the true nature of her own school, the exact kind of subterfuge was always assigned by one of the other teachers. Today, however, Lady Linette informed them that this time they should know what to do when they arrived.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcited by the mystery, the girls hurried through the hallways to be met in the tassel section by Professor Shrimpdittle, trailing a sullen-looking Lord Dingleproops, Lord Mersey, and Pillover Plumleigh-Teignmott. The ten of them entered Mademoiselle Geraldine’s quarters together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs ever, the walls were lined with shelves of fake pastries, and the headmistress rose to welcome them from behind a large table set with a full tea service. She had known to expect a larger than normal gathering, for there were twelve place settings. Her décolletage heaved with appreciation. Mademoiselle Geraldine loved company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting next to her, in the place of honor, was an elderly female. She wore eccentric dress for a woman in the later part of life. Her wild gray hair was loose and her forehead bound over with a colorful scarf, like a sky pirate. Her jewelry was bronze and gold and more prevalent than Dimity’s at her most sparkly. The stranger’s complexion was tan in a manner that young ladies of quality were cautioned against. Her eyes were lined thickly with kohl. Her attire seem to be composed utterly of brightly colored scarves tied in layers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimity gasped in appreciation. “A fortune-teller!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How very esoteric, Madam G.!” crowed Lord Dingleproops, striding up to the headmistress to clap her on the shoulder, rather as a man would approach a fellow at his club. Mademoiselle Geraldine looked at him as though he were a collapsed soufflé, and he backed away hastily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girls tittered in elation. Even Pillover looked pleased, and he was rarely pleased by anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe didn’t go down low to retrieve her, thought Sophronia. How did she get on board?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Very good, Miss Plumleigh-Teignmott. We have indeed been graced with the presence of a fortune-teller.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia wondered, “Did you set off the alarm?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fortune-teller’s eyes sharpened on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia realized she had revealed more of her personality with that one question than was healthy. She was, after all, the only one who’d jumped straight to logistics rather than the exciting possibility of having her palm read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated. Madame Spetuna has been retained for the evening to tell your fortunes.” Mademoiselle Geraldine was wearing a lightweight muslin gown of chartreuse with cream stripes. It was a dress that better suited one of her students. Each stripe was patterned with pink roses. There was fringe all up the length of the sleeves and about the low square neckline that displayed the headmistress’s assets to great effect. Said assets heaved as she inhaled, and Professor Shrimpdittle looked as though he might faint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe continued, “Given that there are ten of you, we must keep the readings brief. So tuck in quickly to the nibbly bits while we do so, and don’t stand on ceremony. If Miss Pelouse would pour the tea? Miss Buss, why don’t you sit first?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreshea took the seat closest to the fortune-teller with alacrity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Spetuna looked her over. “Ze cards, I think, for you, dark child.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreshea was made to pick five cards from a deck and lay them out carefully on the damask tablecloth. Madame Spetuna rearranged them a few times before settling on a pattern she liked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis must be today’s subterfuge challenge. We are to ensure the fortune-teller doesn’t reveal anything to Mademoiselle Geraldine about our real training. Sophronia, nibbling a biscuit, sat back to watch. She wondered about the fortune-teller. Does she know what we do here? Or does she, like Mademoiselle Geraldine, think it is a normal, albeit floating, finishing school?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ah,” breathed Madame Spetuna, “this is most interesting. Most interesting indeed. You, my child, will marry well. More than once. A charmed life, so long as you weave a tight net, little spider.” The lady retrieved the cards and shuffled them back together into one stack in an attitude of dismissal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking this as a sign her fortune was complete, Preshea stood. Looking particularly pleased with life, she passed over a few coins and gave Madame Spetuna a nice curtsy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMademoiselle Geraldine was fanning herself. “Oh, dear, oh, dear, Miss Buss. Let us hope it is widowhood and not”—she whispered the next word—“divorce that leads to your multiple marriages.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreshea sat and sipped from a china cup. “I shouldn’t worry, Headmistress. I am tolerably certain it will be widowhood.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMademoiselle Geraldine was reassured by this. Preshea’s future husbands probably wouldn’t have been. Even Lord Dingleproops, ordinarily unconcerned by those around him, looked apprehensively at the beautiful dark-haired girl. She gave him a wicked smile and a coy lowering of the lashes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReel it in, Preshea. Sophronia glanced nervously at the headmistress. But Mademoiselle Geraldine was waving the next victim forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimity took the danger seat. “I admire your fashion sense,” she told the fortune-teller with absolute sincerity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Spetuna tucked a lock of hair behind her ear—in which there were three earrings!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimity’s eyes sparkled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For you, the palm,” said Madame Spetuna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWide-eyed, Dimity presented the fortune-teller with both hands. Madame Spetuna bent over them, the many rings on her fingers flashing as she traced the lines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia heard Monique whisper to Preshea, “I wouldn’t allow such a dirty, common creature to touch me!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Spetuna gave no indication of having heard. “You wish for a simple life, magpie. You will not get it. You will choose, many times, between loyalty and peace. A terrible choice.” She looked up at Dimity, her dark eyes sad. “I am sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDimity nodded, her round face somber. “That’s all right, Madame Spetuna. I always suspected it might be so.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince she had forgotten her reticule, Dimity slid off one of her own many bracelets and gave it to the fortune-teller. They exchanged the smiles of kindred spirits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMademoiselle Geraldine called Monique. The older girl hid her excitement with a haughty expression. She sat and took up the cards without Madame Spetuna suggesting she do so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You are attracted to the cards, moonbeam? Good. It is always better when one is summoned.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the icy blonde had selected five cards, the fortune-teller bent over them for a time. “You will never be as important as you think you are. That is all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What do you know, old woman?” Monique stood with a sneer and left without offering a gratuity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she went to sit, Mademoiselle Geraldine wrapped the girl’s knuckles hard with a fan. “Manners!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonique, without further comment, curtsied to the fortune-teller and returned to her tea and Preshea’s questionable council.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen it was Agatha’s turn. The redhead asked, in a hesitant voice, if her fortune might be told privately. Sophronia thought to warn her that this might not be permitted by Lady Linette under the subterfuge clause, but there wasn’t time. Madame Spetuna agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgatha was also given the cards. After her selection was laid on the table, Madame Spetuna whispered in her ear. Whatever Agatha’s fortune, it cheered the chubby girl. She was almost animated and passed over a ridiculously large sum to Madame Spetuna in thanks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia wished she were a fortune-teller. It would be an admirable way to inspire discomfort. Professor Shrimpdittle, for example, might be shaken into distrusting Bunson’s. Then again… I wonder how much it costs to buy a fortune? Sophronia assessed her own meager funds. Then, while Agatha bumbled back to her seat, Sophronia pulled out a scrap of paper and a bit of graphite from her reticule. Three shillings, she wrote, to imply that Bunson’s headmaster no longer trusts Prof S. There was no time to code the note; she simply had to hope the fortune-teller was game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSidheag assumed the seat with a certain bravado. She held out her hands without being asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have done this before, wolf child?” Madame Spetuna’s eyes were sharp on Sidheag’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSidheag nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then what I tell you will be no different. You know your fate and you cannot escape it. Why do you dally here pretending to be tame?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSidheag nodded and stood to resume her seat. Her curtsy was perfunctory, but the fortune-teller did not take offense. It was almost as if she knew Sidheag’s curtsies were always perfunctory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally Madame Spetuna gestured to Sophronia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia went eagerly. Suspicious nonsense, of course, but terribly fun suspicious nonsense. I wish Soap could have his fortune told. He’d love it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMadame Spetuna looked her up and down. She said, “The palm, I think, for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia offered both hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fortune-teller seized them by the wrists. Her touch was soft and dry, and she smelled of exotic spices Sophronia could not place. I must train my nose, she thought. Such information could be important, particularly if a given smell is associated with an enemy or an informant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even now, you think only in terms of the game. You are well chosen, little bird. Or are you a stoat?” Madame Spetuna bent forward, looking even harder at Sophronia’s palms. She was close enough for Sophronia to feel the woman’s breath on her skin. “Give your heart wisely.” She paused a long time over one particular wrinkle. “Oh, child, you will end the world as we know it.” Madame Spetuna swallowed and then turned Sophronia’s hands over and placed them, palm down, on the table. She leaned forward, pressing them into the tablecloth as though she might rub out what she had seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an admirable performance. Sophronia thought she ought to applaud. Everyone was silent in awe. Sophronia looked over at Felix. He was making a face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Monique giggled. “Stoat, of course Sophronia’s a stoat.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMademoiselle Geraldine recovered her composure. “What a very odd fortune, Miss Temminnick. What game could she possibly be referring to?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Headmistress, we have been playing loo these last few nights. Perhaps it is that?” Sophronia lied easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMademoiselle Geraldine looked relieved. “Oh, yes, indeed. Now, which of the gentlemen would like to go next?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia stood, reached into her reticule, and passed the fortune-teller a shilling and the note. Since handling and exchanging money was always an embarrassment, everyone made a point of not really watching the gratuity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSophronia pretended to get her skirt caught in the chair as she rose. In a flurry of long sleeves she bent and almost tipped Madame Spetuna’s teacup over. Under cover of this, the fortune-teller opened and read the note.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time Sophronia had sorted herself, and the chair, out—Mademoiselle Geraldine reprimanding her for such unladylike clumsiness—the note had vanished, and Madame Spetuna was giving Sophronia a funny look. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/curtsies-conspiracies-finishing-school-2/page-20.html","bookId":1613,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:25 PM"}
