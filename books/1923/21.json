didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had been down that road too many times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI knew I could so easily fall back into old self- destructive habits to dull pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would kill me to lose Gideon, but I\u0027d be dead anyway if I lost myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to hang on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGet by.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne step at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so I climbed into the back of the Bentley when I was supposed to, and while Angus\u0027s grim face only made me worry more, I locked it down and slid into the autopilot mode of self- preservation that would get me through the hours ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy day passed in a blur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI worked hard and focused on my job, using it to keep me from going crazy, but my heart wasn\u0027t in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spent my lunch hour running an errand, unable to tolerate the thought of eating or making small talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter my shift was over, I almost blew off going to my Krav Maga class, but I stuck it out and gave a similar amount of focus to the drills as I\u0027d given to my work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to keep moving forward, even if I was heading in a direction I couldn\u0027t bear to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better,\" Parker said, during a break.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re still off, but you\u0027re better than last night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and wiped the sweat from my face with a towel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d started Parker\u0027s classes solely as a more intense alternative to my usual gym visits, but last night had shown me that personal safety was more than just a convenient side benefit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tribal tattoos that banded his biceps flexed as he lifted a water bottle to his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he was left-handed, his simple gold wedding band caught the light and my eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was reminded of the promise ring on my right hand and I looked down at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remembered when Gideon had given it to me and how he\u0027d said that the diamond-crusted Xs wrapping around the roped gold were representative of him \"holding on\" to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered if he still thought that way; if he still thought it was worth it to try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod knew I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ready?\" Parker asked, tossing his empty bottle in the recycle bin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There she is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParker still worked me over, but it wasn\u0027t from lack of trying on my part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was in it every step of the way, venting my frustration with good, healthy exercise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe few victories I managed to earn spurred my determination to fight for my rocky relationship, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was willing to put in the time and effort to be there for Gideon, to be a better and stronger person so we could get through our issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I was going to tell him that, whether he wanted to hear it or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen my hour was over, I cleaned up and waved good-bye to my classmates and then shoved at the push bar of the exit door and stepped out into the still-warm evening air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClancy had already brought the car around to the door and was leaning against the fender in a pose that only a moron would think was casual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the heat, he wore a jacket, which concealed his sidearm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Things moving along?\" He straightened to open the door for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs long as I\u0027d known him, he\u0027d kept his dark blond hair in a military crew cut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt added to the impression of his being a very somber man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Working on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSliding into the backseat, I told Clancy to drop me off at Gideon\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had my own key and I was prepared to use it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the drive over, I wondered if Gideon had gone to see Dr.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePetersen for his appointment or if he\u0027d blown it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d agreed to individual therapy only because of me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I wasn\u0027t part of the equation anymore, he might not see any reason to make the effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI entered the understated and elegant lobby of Gideon\u0027s apartment building and checked in with the front desk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t until I was alone in his private elevator that the nerves really hit me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d placed me on his approved list weeks before, a gesture that meant so much more to him and me than it would to others because Gideon\u0027s home was his sanctuary, a place he allowed few visitors to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was the only lover he\u0027d ever entertained there and the only person, aside from his household staff, who had a key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYesterday I wouldn\u0027t have doubted my welcome, but now .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI exited into a small foyer decorated with checkerboard marble tiles and an antique console bearing a massive arrangement of white calla lilies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore I unlocked his front door, I took a deep breath, steeling myself for however I might find him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one previous time he\u0027d attacked me in his sleep, it had shattered him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t help but fear what the second time had done to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was terrified that his parasomnia might be the wedge that drove us apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the moment I entered his apartment, I knew he wasn\u0027t home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe energy that thrummed through a space when he occupied it was markedly absent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLights that were activated by my movements came on when I entered the expansive living room, and I forced myself to settle in as if I belonged there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy room was down the hall and I went to it, pausing on the threshold to absorb the weirdness of seeing my bedroom replicated in Gideon\u0027s place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe duplication was uncanny, from the color on the walls to the furniture and fabrics, but its existence was more than a little unnerving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon had created it as my safe room, a place for me to run to when I needed some space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI supposed I was running to it now, in a way, by using it instead of his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSetting my workout bag and purse on the bed, I showered and changed into one of the Cross Industries T- shirts Gideon had set aside for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried not to think about why he still wasn\u0027t home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d just poured a glass of wine and turned on the living room television when my smartphone rang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello?\" I answered, unfamiliar with the number on the nameless Caller ID.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eva? It\u0027s Shawna.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, hey, Shawna.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried not to sound disappointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope it\u0027s not too late to call.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the screen of my phone, noting that it was almost nine o\u0027clock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJealousy mingled with my concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere was he? \"No worries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m just watching TV.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry I missed your call last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know it\u0027s short notice, but I wanted to see if you\u0027d be up for going to a Six- Ninths concert on Friday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A what concert?\" \"Six-Ninths.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou haven\u0027t heard of \u0027em?

The show starts at nine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGideon walked in just as I answered, \"You\u0027ve got a date.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood just inside the door with his jacket slung over one arm, the top button of his dress shirt undone, and a briefcase in his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mask was in place, showing no emotion whatsoever at finding me sprawled on his couch in his T-shirt with a glass of his wine on his table and his television on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe raked me with a head-to-toe glance, but nothing flickered in those beautiful eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suddenly felt awkward and unwanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll get back to you about the other ticket,\" I told Shawna, sitting up slowly so I didn\u0027t flash him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks for thinking of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just glad you\u0027re coming!
