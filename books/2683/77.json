Did she actually come with you, Victor? How in the f**k did she weasel in here? Did you see the f**king look she gave me when I first made eye contact?\" Alison wipes herself and, still sitting there, immediately begins to rummage through a Prada handbag. \"That bitch actually told Chris O\u0027Donnell that I run a quote-unquote highly profitable fat-substitute emporium.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think your meeting could definitely be construed as an uh-oh moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if you keep ignoring me you\u0027re gonna have a whole night chock-full of them.\" In the Prada handbag Alison finds two vials and stands up, her voice brimming with acid. \"Oh, but I forgot, you don\u0027t want to see me anymore. You want to break up. You need your space. You, Victor, are a major loser.\" She tries to compose herself, fails. \"I think I\u0027m gonna be sick. I\u0027m gonna be sick all over you. How could you do this to me? And of all nights!\" She\u0027s hissing to herself, unscrewing the top of one vial, doing two, three, six huge bumps of coke, then suddenly she stops, inspects the vial, then says \"Wrong vial\" and unscrews the other one and does four bumps from that. \"You\u0027re not going to get away with this. You\u0027re not. Oh my god.\" She grabs her head. \"I think I have sickle-cell anemia.\" Then, snapping her head up, she shrieks, \"And why in the hell is your girlfriend-sorry, ex-girlfriend-wearing the same f**king dress I am?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" I shout out. \"Does it bother you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s just say-\" Alison starts coughing, her face crumples up and between huge sobs she wails, \"it was mildly horrifying?\" She immediately recovers, slaps my face, grabs my shoulders and screams, \"You\u0027re not getting away with this!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With what?\" I shout, grabbing a vial away from her, scooping out two huge capfuls for myself. \"What am I not getting away with?\"\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/glamorama/page-77.html","bookId":2683,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:02 AM"}
