She was in her room touching up her makeup, and Alexander was still getting ready to go out with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was disillusioned in her friend. \"I knew you couldn\u0027t trust Jagger,\" she continued. \"But Luna. How could I have been so wrong about her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, she was always good to you,\" I tried to assure her, standing next to her at her dresser. \"It\u0027s just that she\u0027s not so good to others.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if she isn\u0027t good to you - then that is wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think she feels she\u0027s doing the right thing.\" I wasn\u0027t sure why I was sticking up for Luna. Maybe it was only to comfort Stormy\u0027s feelings. \"Anyway, they were offering me something I wanted,\" I said, \"just with the wrong guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStormy had the life I had dreamed of. A casket sat in the middle of the wall where normally a bed would be. I sat down on the edge of her chaise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you want?\" she asked, sitting next to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To become a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You really want to be one?\" Her expression brightened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said. \"I always have. But I want to with Alexander.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d change for Alexander?\" She was shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. But that doesn\u0027t mean I wouldn\u0027t want to be with him regardless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you would become a vampire? Willingly?\" she asked, surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. I\u0027ve wanted it all my life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even before you met Alexander?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but I\u0027d only want to be a vampire with him,\" I said emphatically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed my hand. \"I didn\u0027t know you wanted to be like us, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly like you. Cool, nice, and living amongst your own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does Alexander know this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. I\u0027ve told him a hundred times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then what is my brother waiting for?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He wants it to be the right time. And for the right reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if that\u0027s want you want - and he does, too - then why is he being so stubborn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He thinks I won\u0027t like it. And that I\u0027ll blame him. He feels too much pressure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I know I will be happy. In fact, getting to know you has really convinced me how much I\u0027d like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. You are the most fabulous girl ever,\" I said, using her favorite compliment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not as fabulous as you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. If I were a mortal, I\u0027d want to be like you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe smiled at each other, and Stormy blushed a little bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if I were a vampire - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you can be!\" Stormy interrupted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not so sure he\u0027s ready.\" I sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must tell him. Now. You must make sure he knows how important it is to you. Then we can be one big happy family.\" Just then Alexander entered the room. Stormy and I rose, and I headed over to him. \"What\u0027s going on?\" he asked, kissing me on the cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Girl talk,\" Stormy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aren\u0027t you supposed to be with Jameson getting tutored?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" she said. \"Remember what I said,\" she whispered to me, and winked before she hopped down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see you two are getting along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, we really see eye to eye,\" I said, beaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later, Alexander and I were talking in the gazebo in the backyard of the Mansion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I still can\u0027t believe Jagger had you up on the covenant altar,\" he said, shaking his head. \"After all he and I have been through. To do that to you - and me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just glad we came in when we did - but it seems you were able to handle yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was more of an offer - \" I said. \"But still it was wrong. I had to get out the garlic powder for him to know I was serious, too.\" The offer was attractive, and though I didn\u0027t want to become a vampire with Jagger, I was flattered that someone wanted to change me. I knew Alexander did, but Jagger was offering it to me only last night. It was something I couldn\u0027t shake. If Jagger wanted it, thought about it, and tried to make it happen, did that mean Alexander would, too?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why would he think that you would do that with him?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He just thinks of himself,\" I said. \"But I also think that somehow he understands me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean by that?\" Alexander was taken aback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He can see that it\u0027s really what I want. What I\u0027ve always wanted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t think I understand you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I do. But I guess he\u0027s more impulsive. Like Sebastian. That\u0027s what makes you so special - your thoughtfulness,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, when it\u0027s time for you to turn,\" he said reassuringly, \"it will be by me.\" The stars twinkled through the broken boards in the roof. The night was perfect, and Alexander was giving me the dreamiest kiss I could have imagined receiving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slid his fangs down the side of my neck. As usual I was dying for him to take the plunge. When he pulled away, I followed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slid his fangs down the side of my neck. As usual I was dying for him to take the plunge. When he pulled away, I followed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know your parents, your best friend, and now your sister,\" I began. \"Unless you are hiding a brother and a dog, I think I\u0027ve met your whole family.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe now\u0027s the time. I see Stormy and how she lives. I want that life for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to be isolated and in constant threat of being found out you are a vampiou yore?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I want the other part. To sleep in a coffin by day and be awake all night. To live by candlelight. To be a part of the Underworld. I have craved these things all my life. I want to share that with you and your family and friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But don\u0027t you already?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Luna has Romeo, and Becky has Matt. They are all sharing the same world. But us? We are trapped in our own separate human and vampire lives. Forced to live without being together as much as we could be if we were truly part of the same world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know,\" he concurred. \"I miss out on so much in your life, being stuck alone in my coffin while you\u0027re at school. I should be there eating lunch with you, studying, hanging out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s how I feel about my life, too. If only I was a vampire, then I wouldn\u0027t be rotting away in school all day when I could be sharing a coffin with you, celebrating the night together, and be bonded together for eternity.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know I can never be a normal, mortal student. Maybe it\u0027s for the best, though. I\u0027d be the dumbest guy in school. I wouldn\u0027t get any work done because all day I\u0027d be staring at you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was sweet that Alexander wished he could live in my world. But I was dying to join his just as much as he longed for mine. \"Well... I\u0027m not sure it is for the best,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI faced Alexander straight on and stared into his chocolate eyes. \"Even if you can\u0027t be a mortal, why couldn\u0027t I become a vampire?\" Alexander knew better than to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d asked him a million times before, but tonight I was determined to know. I pressed further. \"Don\u0027t you see? We could be together not only for eternity - but for every day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Alexander didn\u0027t respond, I continued. \"Think of all that we are missing. Becky sees Matt every day at school and on the weekends.\" The more I thought about it, the more serious I became.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. It\u0027s hard for me, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It doesn\u0027t have to be anymore. This is something we can do for us. You and me. It doesn\u0027t matter what others will think. You said you didn\u0027t have the covenant ceremony with Luna because you were waiting to find the right someone. I thought I was that someone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are. Don\u0027t ever think you aren\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Stormy was convinced of that, I thought. All I had to do was to make my vampire boyfriend really understanallconvid how important this was for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why not turn me?\" I asked. I was more forceful than I had ever been with Alexander regarding this issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It is hard for me, too, Raven. Since I first saw you. I told you, I crave you in a way you can\u0027t even imagine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let me finally fulfill that need.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But don\u0027t you think you\u0027re too young to make such a life-changing decision? It\u0027s not only a life decision but an eternal one as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course I\u0027m not too young. I\u0027m seventeen. I\u0027m almost old enough to vote or join the military. Is there an age minimum on making decisions?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you have to really consider everything. What if you don\u0027t like being a vampire?\" he asked as if he was plagued with this concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s there not to like?\" I asked. I knew he and I had often discussed whether the lifestyle I craved was the lifestyle I\u0027d ultimately be happy with. But I knew I would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if you hate it and then blame me?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that what this is about? That I will regret being bitten?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No ... and yes. It\u0027s both. You would be giving up everything. It\u0027s so much pressure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For you or me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"For us both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But don\u0027t you see you\u0027ve been the one changing all along? You\u0027ve stayed here in Dullsville when you could have returned home to Romania. You\u0027ve left yourself in isolation without friends or family and only Jameson to keep you company. Now it\u0027s my turn to change.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But people have different opinions as they grow. You might like vampires now, but what if you don\u0027t like them in the future and you\u0027re stuck being one for eternity?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been the same person since I was born. You know me, and I know myself. I don\u0027t follow trends. Believe me, my life would have been so much easier if I had been willing to do that. I could have been popular, maybe, not the outcast that I am,\" I said, reflecting. \"Who knows? The one thing I know is that ever since I can remember, I\u0027ve wanted to be a vampire. And I still do. And I\u0027ve always wanted to be in love - and when I saw you, I knew that no matter what or who you were, I had to be with you forever. I may be impulsive, but I\u0027m not fickle. I\u0027ll be seventy and still be wearing miniskirts and combat boots and wanting to be a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander laughed, but I was serious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe the on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to know,\" I asked, looking him right in the eyes. \"Are we on the same path?\" I was as surprised as he was by my forcefulness. But I remembered my and Becky\u0027s conversation about our futures. We\u0027d have to be thinking of college soon and what we wanted to pursue for our futures. Did Alexander want the same things I did? Did he want me to share those things with him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was as excited about his impending answer as I was afraid of it. If he wavered or was unsure, how would that make me feel? He\u0027d taken my blood as his own, but would he ultimately go further? Would I be able to really become a vampire, or would we just continue to share our different worlds together?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need to know,\" I said again. Jagger\u0027s offer was flattering but not something I\u0027d really consider since I loved Alexander. And now that Stormy wanted me to be part of the Underworld, I realized the only one who was reticent about my being turned was my one true love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to know how you feel about our future.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you knew,\" he said with a sad expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI did know Alexander wanted us to be together, but I wanted to make sure he also wanted me to be a vampire - his vampire. I felt my blood boil. I wanted to be a vampire so badly that I needed the reassurance that I would be one day. \"I just want you to tell me ... that it will happen!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want me to bite you now - or else?\" he pressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it isn\u0027t really an ultimatum. But how long am I supposed to wait?\" I blurted out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I was turned when I was thirty, wouldn\u0027t that be good enough? I wondered. But even that seemed like light-years away from now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held my hand up, accentuating my finger where I wore his glistening eternity ring. \"Doesn\u0027t this mean anything to you? Don\u0027t my actions speak loud enough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander was taken aback. He released my hand and slid away from me. \"Is that what this is all about, Raven? You waiting to become a vampire? Not about Alexander was taken aback. He released my hand and slid away from me. \"Is that what this is all about, Raven? You waiting to become a vampire? Not about us being together as ourselves?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No...\" My heart sank. I had gone too far. I didn\u0027t mean to offend Alexander. He had given me a gift that every day reminded me of his feelings toward me. I was foolish to have pressed him. My need to be more like him - to be what I\u0027d always wanted to be - had gotten in the way of our wonderful evening together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy couldn\u0027t I just stay in the moment and let him enjoy having his sister in town and our privacy together instead of me demanding to be turned? Maybe I already was a vampire in a mortal\u0027s body. I craved Alexander so much I couldn\u0027t bear the thought of us not spending eternity together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve waited seventeen years to meet you,\" he said. \"The blood that runs through me isn\u0027t like yours. It is centuries old. You can live without me, Raven. I can\u0027t without you. You always act as if this is torture for you. But it\u0027s also torture for me.\" I was struck by his strong reaction. I thought he was in a playful mood and would have just shrugged off my habitual pushiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s getting late,\" he said, rising.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy did I have to know this minute? Didn\u0027t I have all that I wanted here in Dullsville without spoiling it? I had my whole life ahead of me - but I wanted everything now. I knew I was lucky enough to have Alexander and to have the Crypt, too. But there was always that piece of me that wanted to be a vampire just like I had since I was a child. But what I was asking Alexander to do wasn\u0027t something to be taken lightly. And I was letting my needs and impatience get the best of both of us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We should go,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll take you home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like Stormy had felt the night before, I wasn\u0027t ready for our evening to be cut short.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I said. \"Let\u0027s stay here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to check on Stormy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I can stay here while you do that. Or I can come with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander wouldn\u0027t be swayed and wasn\u0027t giving in to me, just like he hadn\u0027t given in to his sister. He was ready for the evening to end. He began walking toward the front of the Mansion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt broke my heart to see him mad at me. We rarely fought. I thought I\u0027d rather not become a vampire than have him angry with me. I didn\u0027t want to lose him altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, Alexander....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe headed for the Mercedes parked out front, and I had to run to catch up to his quick pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the car door for me but didn\u0027t wait until I got in before he went to the driver\u0027s side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t mean to make you mad,\" I said, scooting in and closing the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not mad,\" he said. But clearly he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned on the engine and headed down the driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI placed my hand on his shoulder, but he didn\u0027t cave in. His mood was like a jagged icicle thrust through my heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know how I feel about you,\" I said. \"I just want to be like you, that\u0027s all. I should be able to tell you.\" Alexander didn\u0027t handle his feelings like Becky and I did. Our every thought and mood flowed like Niagara Falls from our lips. Alexander kept his feelings to himself, and it pained me in ways that I couldn\u0027t express to see him shutting off from me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was angry with myself that I\u0027d spoiled the evening, and with him, too, that he\u0027d taken what I\u0027d said the wrong way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to go home like this,\" I said when he pulled up in front of my house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander was too much of a gentleman to let me walk to the door alone. He came around and opened my door. When I didn\u0027t budge from my seat, he glared at me as if he would carry me out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI exited the car and tried to hide the tear that began to trickle down my cheek as he headed for my door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know I love you - even if I never become a vampire,\" I said to him when we reached the stoop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis dark eyes softened as if he felt all the emotion behind my genuine words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was hoping for a good-night kiss or anything to show me that our misunderstanding was over. But he headed back down the drive instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat on the stoop. \"I\u0027m not going inside until you make up with me!\" I called to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut this time my stubbornness didn\u0027t deter him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got into the Mercedes and drove down the street while my tears flowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was devastated. What had just happened? Alexander and I were having the dreamiest night together, and I spoiled it by insisting again that he turn me. This time I\u0027d pushed Alexander too far. He was more practical than I was, and that was one of the reasons I was so drawn to him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to become a vampire. But I wanted it under the best of terms. Love, passion, and a visceral, physical, and spiritual need for each other. I didn\u0027t want to be matched up with someone like he\u0027d been with Luna - or tricked like Sebastian almost was. And I didn\u0027t want the business transaction that Jagger had offered me. I wanted my becoming a vampire to have been thought through, carefully considered with both of our minds, hearts, and souls. If Alexander was impulsive and irrational like I was, then he would be a completely different guy - a different kind of person and vampire. And ultimately, that was not what I wanted. I thought about if I\u0027d met Jagger instead of Alexander - who knows how I\u0027d feel about being a vampire now? My life and eternity would be about tricks, menacing, and deceit. And if I\u0027d been turned by Sebastian, it would have been about living eternity on a whim, noton own the putting down roots but continually moving whenever he felt the need. We\u0027d be slackers, running around from place to place without purpose. And though that seemed like it could be a lot of fun, I was more driven and motivated. I knew what I wanted out of life and out of eternity, and I wanted to share that with someone who knew what they wanted, too. Alexander had his passion in all the right places: his art, his family, me. And not only was he smoldering hot, he was just as attractive on the inside. He cared about me, his friends, and our families, and put our needs before his own. If not, wouldn\u0027t he be the kind of vampire who hunted girls and preyed on their flesh? Not the romantic, artistic type I found irresistible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd asking someone to physically turn me into something that I wasn\u0027t born being wasn\u0027t to be taken lightly. If I\u0027d been the one who had to turn Alexander into a mortal, become someone different from his own family, it would be a huge burden to me. I would do anything to make him happy, like he wanted to do for me, but I understood that it was a difficult decision to make. And if he\u0027d felt any other way about turning me, with all its thrills and complications, then he wouldn\u0027t be my Alexander Sterling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realized that not having Alexander at all was far worse than my not becoming a vampire. If I had to live by his side just as I was, that was good enough for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny life with Alexander was better than a life without him. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/immortal-hearts-vampire-kisses-9/page-18.html","bookId":2147,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:20:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:20:23 PM"}
