He\u0027s playing with me now... just like his father played with Mom, before he... well, did what he did to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen I hear a strange sound-a sort of whoosh-followed by another \"Dammit!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is happening?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sebastian.\" Lila\u0027s voice sounds bemused. \"Someone is shooting ketchup at you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat? Did she just say... ketchup?.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, as I carefully turn to try to get a look past the pillar to see what Lila is talking about, I see him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot Sebastian. His shooter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I can hardly believe my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0027s he doing here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s all Ted\u0027s fault. He\u0027s the one who said we should follow them on their date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was like, \"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u0027Cause the dude\u0027s trouble, man,\" Ted said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept there\u0027s no way Ted could have known that. Drake had basically turned up from out of nowhere outside Lila\u0027s Park Avenue apartment building just the night before. Ted had never even met him. How could he know anything about the guy? Anything at all?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when I mentioned this, Ted said, \"Dude, have you looked at him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have to admit, the T Man has a point. I mean, the guy looks like he walked straight out of an Abercrombie \u0026amp; Fitch catalog or something. You can\u0027t trust a guy who\u0027s that, well, perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I\u0027m not down with following other guys around. It\u0027s not cool. Even if, like Ted said, it was just to make sure Lila didn\u0027t get into trouble. I know Lila is Ted\u0027s lady-ex-lady now, thanks to Drake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd okay, she\u0027s never been the shiniest fork in the drawer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut following her on this date with the dude she\u0027s hooked up with? That just seemed like a bigger waste of time than-well, that two thousand-word, double-spaced essay I\u0027ve got due in Mrs. Gregory\u0027s U.S. History class on Monday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Ted had to go and suggest I bring the Beretta 9mm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thing is, even though it\u0027s just a water pistol, toy guns that look as real as that are illegal in Manhattan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I haven\u0027t really had an opportunity to use mine much. Which Ted knows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd is probably why he kept going on about how freaking hilarious it would be if we soaked the guy. Because he knew I wouldn\u0027t be able to resist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ketchup was my idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd, yeah, it is pretty juvenile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what the hell else am I going to do on a Friday night? It beats a U.S. History paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, I told the T Man I guessed I\u0027d be down with his plan. So long as I was the one who got to do the shooting. Which was fine with Ted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just gotta know, man,\" he\u0027d said, shaking his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Know what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What this Sebastian dude\u0027s got,\" he said, \"that I don\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could\u0027ve told him, of course. I mean, it\u0027s pretty obvious to anyone who freaking looks at Drake what he\u0027s got that Ted doesn\u0027t. Ted\u0027s a decent-looking guy and all, but Abercrombie material he is not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I didn\u0027t say anything. Because the T Man was really hurtin\u0027 over this one. And I could sort of understand why. Lila\u0027s just one of those girls, you know? All big brown eyes and big, well, other parts, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I won\u0027t go there on account of my sister, Veronica, who says I need to stop thinking of women as sex objects and start thinking of them as future partners in the inevitable struggle to survive in postapocalyptic America (which Veronica\u0027s writing her senior thesis on because she feels the apocalypse is going to occur sometime in the next decade, due to the country\u0027s current state of religious fanaticism and environmental recklessness, both of which were present at the fall of Rome and various other societies that no longer exist).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that\u0027s how me and the T Man ended up at Swig-fortunately, Ted\u0027s uncle Vinnie is their liquor distributor, which is how we got in, and without having to go through the metal detector like everybody else-shooting ketchup at Sebastian Drake with my Beretta 9mm water pistol. I know I was supposed to be home doing that paper for Mrs. Gregory, but a guy\u0027s got to have some fun, right?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it was fun to see those red stains spurting all over the guy\u0027s chest. The T Man was actually laughing for the first time since Lila sent him that text message during lunch, telling him that he was on his own for the prom, because she was going with Drake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything was going great... until I saw Drake staring at that pillar over to one side of the dance floor. Which didn\u0027t make any sense. You\u0027d have thought he\u0027d have been looking over at us, in our VIP booth (thanks, Uncle Vinnie), considering that\u0027s the direction the ketchup assault was coming from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0027s when I noticed there was somebody hiding behind it. The pillar, I mean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot just any somebody, either, but Mary, that new girl from my U.S. History class, the one who never talks to anybody but Lila.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she was holding a crossbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA crossbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow the hell did she get a crossbow through the metal detector? No way does she know Ted\u0027s uncle Vinnie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that it matters. All that matters is that Drake\u0027s staring at the pillar Mary\u0027s crouched behind like he can see straight through it. There\u0027s something about the way he\u0027s looking over at her that makes me... well, all I know is that is not where I want that guy looking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Moron,\" I mutter. Mostly about Drake. But also about myself, a little. And then I aim and shoot once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, snap,\" Ted yells happily. \"Did you see that? Right in the ass!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat gets Drake\u0027s attention, all right. He turns...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e... and suddenly, I get what they mean about blazing eyes. You know, in Stephen King books, or whatever? I never thought I\u0027d actually see a pair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that\u0027s exactly what Drake\u0027s got, as he stares at us. Eyes that are most definitely blazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCome on, I find myself thinking in Drake\u0027s direction. That\u0027s right. Come on over here, Drake. You wanna fight? I\u0027ve got a lot more than just ketchup, dude.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhich isn\u0027t exactly true. But it doesn\u0027t end up mattering, because Drake doesn\u0027t come over anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, he disappears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t mean that he turns around and leaves the club.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean that one minute he\u0027s standing there, and the next he\u0027s... well, he\u0027s just gone. For a second the fog from the dry ice seems to get thicker-and when it clears, Lila is dancing by herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here,\" I say, thrusting the Beretta into Ted\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the-\" Ted scans the dance floor. \"Where\u0027d he go?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I\u0027ve already taken off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Grab Lila,\" I yell back at Ted. \"And meet me out front.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTed utters some pretty choice expletives after that, but no one even notices. The music\u0027s too loud, and everyone\u0027s having too good a time. I mean, if they didn\u0027t notice us shooting at some dude with a ketchup-filled water gun-or a few seconds later, that dude literally vanishing into thin air-they\u0027re hardly likely to notice Ted shouting the F word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reach the pillar and look down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027s there, panting as if she\u0027s just run a marathon or something. She\u0027s got the crossbow clutched to her chest like a kid\u0027s security blanket. Her face is as white as notebook paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey,\" I say to her, gently. I don\u0027t want to startle her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut I do anyway. She practically jumps out of her skin at the sound of my voice and turns wide, frightened eyes up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, take it easy,\" I say. \"He\u0027s gone. Okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s gone?\" Her eyes-green as the Great Lawn in Central Park in May-stare up at me. And there\u0027s no missing the terror in them. \"How-what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He just vanished,\" I say with a shrug. \"I saw him looking at you. So I shot him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You what?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/prom-nights-from-hell/page-2.html","bookId":2030,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 11:23:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:23:12 PM"}
