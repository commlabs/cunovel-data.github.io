Ruling in an age when justice prevailed over all the world. We’ve long since fallen from that age, of course, and much as people might bemoan our state no one wants it back, if you know what I mean.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Why not?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Because then we’d actually be taken to task for all the terrible stuff we do. Besides, being fallen excuses our worst traits. We’re not what we once were, too bad, but that’s just how it is. Thank Hood and all the rest.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalyth was slowly nodding. ‘Then is it your belief that we can be no better than who and what we are now?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Something like that.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What if I were to tell you that the Malazans seek to change that? That they seek to rise higher, taller? That, once fallen, they now wish to stand? One more time. Perhaps the last time. And not just for themselves, but for all of us.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA snort from Precious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaint frowned, and then shook her head. ‘Then why fight the Forkrul Assail?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Because the Forkrul Assail have judged us – they came among my people, so this I know all too well. And in that judgement, they have decided that we must all die. Not just in Kolanse, not just on the Plains of Elan. But everywhere.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Given our history, that’s not too surprising.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘But, Faint of the Trygalle Trade Guild, the Forkrul Assail are in no position to judge. I have tasted the ancient flavours of the K’Chain Che’Malle, and it is as if that history was now my own. The Age of Justice – and the time of the Forkrul Assail – ended not at the hand of enemies, or foreign races, but at the hands of the Forkrul Assail themselves.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘How?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘They judged their own god, and found him wanting. And for his imperfections, they finally killed him.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead was a large tent, and the prince, Aranict, and the Malazans entered, taking the lantern’s light with them. Faint held back in the darkness, Kalyth at her side. Behind them, Precious Thimble reined in, but still did not dismount.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKalyth continued, ‘There was war. Between the K’Chain Che’Malle and the Assail. The causes were mundane – the hunger for land, mostly. The Forkrul Assail had begun wars of extermination against many other races, but none had the strength and will to oppose them as did the K’Chain Che’Malle. When the war began to turn against the Assail, they turned on their own god, and in the need for yet more power they wounded him. But wounding proved not enough. They took more and more from him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The K’Chain Che’Malle nests began to fall one by one, until the last surviving Matron, in her desperation, opened a portal to the heart of chaos and set her back against it, hiding its presence from the advancing Assail. And when at last she stood facing them, when the tortured god’s power rushed to annihilate her and all her kind, she surrendered her life, and the gate, which she had sealed with her own body, her own life force, opened. To devour the Assail god’s soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He was too wounded to resist. What remained of him, in this realm, was shattered, mindless and lost.’ Her eyes glittered. ‘You have seen the Glass Desert. That is where all that remains of that god now lives. If one could call it a life.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘What happened to the Assail, Kalyth?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman shrugged. ‘Their power spent, they were broken. Though they blamed the Matron for the loss of their god, it was by their judgement that he was wielded as would one wield a weapon, a thing to be used, a thing not worthy of anything else. In any case, they had not the strength to exterminate the K’Chain Che’Malle. But the truth was the war had destroyed both races, and when other races appeared through the cracks of chaos – which could now reach this and every realm – neither could stop the invasions. More wars, defeats, betrayals, until the age itself crumbled and was no more.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘This has the sound of legend, Kalyth,’ Faint said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘The memory of every Matron is passed down in the blood, the oils – the secretions. Nothing is lost. Gunth Mach has offered me some of their flavours. Much of it I cannot be certain of – there was a time, between the stars … I don’t know. And it may be that I did not fully understand the tale I have just told. It may be that many truths were lost to me – our senses are so limited, compared to those of the K’Chain Che’Malle.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘You have given reason for why the K’Chain Che’Malle seek to fight the Forkrul Assail. Because their war never ended.’\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-276.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
