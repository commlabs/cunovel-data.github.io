She saw a barely perceptible wrinkle at the corner of her eye and frowned. It\u0027s unfair, she thought. A man can completely let himself go. He can have gray hair, a pot-belly and a face like a road map, and no one thinks anything of it. But let a woman get one tiny wrinkle... She began to apply her makeup. Bob Schiffer, Hollywood\u0027s top makeup artist had taught her some of his techniques. Jill put on a pan-stick base instead of the powder base that she had once used. Powder dried the skin, while the pan stick kept it moist. Next, she concentrated on her eyes, the makeup under the lower lids three or four shades lighter than her other makeup, so that the shadows were softened. She rubbed in a small amount of eye shadow to give her eyes more color, then carefully applied false eyelashes over her own lashes, tilting them at the outer edges at a forty-five-degree angle. She brushed some Duo adhesive on her own outer lashes and joined them with the false lashes, making the eyes look larger. To give the lashes a fuller look, she drew fine dots on her lower eyelid beneath her own lashes. After that, Jill applied her lipstick, then powdered her lips before applying a second coat of lipstick. She applied a blusher to her cheeks and dusted her face with powder, avoiding the areas around her eyes where the powder would accentuate the faint wrinkles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJill sat back in her chair and studied the effect in the mirror. She looked beautiful. Someday, she would have to resort to the tape trick, but thank God that was still years away. Jill knew of older actresses who used the trick. They fastened tiny pieces of Scotch tape to their skin just below the hairline. Attached to these tapes were threads which they tied around their heads and concealed beneath their hair. The result was to pull the slackened skin of their faces taut, giving the effect of a face lift without the expense and pain of surgery. A variation was also used to disguise their sagging breasts. A piece of tape attached to the breast on one end and to the firmer flesh higher on the chest on the other provided a simple temporary solution to the problem. Jill\u0027s breasts were still firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe finished combing her soft, black hair, took one final look in the mirror, glanced at her watch and realized that she would have to hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had an interview for \"The Toby Temple Show.\"\u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-stranger-in-the-mirror/page-25.html","bookId":2355,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:04:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:04:25 AM"}
