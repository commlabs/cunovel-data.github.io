It was not fair that he could overwhelm her—by touching her, caressing her, seducing her with his low, velvety voice and rich masculine scent. His emerald gaze burned, half-lidded with a desire she’d done nothing to arouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst her will, her hands slipped around his lean waist and caressed the powerful length of his back. “You’re horrid to be so tender.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis sweat-misted forehead rested against hers. He groaned, his fingers slipping under the long hem of her riding jacket. “You’re wearing too many damned clothes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her mouth again, his tongue caressing with lush, deep licks. Lost in his kiss, she didn’t realize he’d lifted and moved her until he kicked the door to his bedroom closed behind them, shutting them away from the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProtesting, she attempted to pull away. Then his hand cupped the curve of her breast, bringing aching pleasure even through the barrier of her garments. She moaned into his mouth and he tilted his head in response, deepening an already drowning kiss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth stood rigid, her arms at her sides, her thoughts warring with the dictates of her body. Her blood was on fire, her skin hot and painfully tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want you.” His voice was a rough-edged caress. “I want to bury myself inside you until we forget ourselves.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t want to forget.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis tone deepened. “I must think of this mission and the events that took place today, but I cannot. Because all I can think of is you. There isn’t room for anything else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlacing her fingers over his lips, Elizabeth silenced the seductive words that should have sounded practiced and confident, but didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tossed the counterpane back, revealing decadent silk sheets. With soft, tender kisses, he attempted to distract her from his fingers, which worked with deft skill to free the row of buttons that barred him from her skin. Slipping his hands under the open flaps, he pushed the jacket to the floor. She shivered even though she was flushed and he crushed her to his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hush,” he murmured against her forehead. “It’s just you and me. Leave your father and Eldridge out of our bed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe buried her face in the linen of his shirt and breathed him in. “I hate it when you leave me no privacy at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning her head to rest her cheek against his chest, Elizabeth took a shuddering breath. The bed was massive, easily big enough to sleep four large men side by side with room to spare. It waited … for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Look at me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer gaze found his again, discovering a deep needy emerald hunger. Her lips quivered softly and Marcus leaned over, brushing his mouth across hers. “Don’t be afraid,” he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemaining in a bedroom with him was the worst sort of danger. Far more dangerous than the attacker in the park. That man struck swiftly, like a viper. Marcus was more of a python. He would wrap himself around her and squeeze the life from her slowly until nothing of her independence remained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not afraid.” She shoved him backward as her stomach clenched tight. Caring nothing for her jacket, longing only to be away from him, she walked quickly to the door. “I am leaving.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEscape was seconds away when he grabbed her roughly and threw her face down upon the bed. “What are you doing?” she cried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus held her down, his grip tight as he bound her hands together with his cravat. “You would leave here half-dressed,” he growled, “in your eagerness to put distance between us. This fear you have of me must be banished. You have to trust me implicitly, in every way, without question or you could be killed.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is the way you win trust?” she snapped. “By holding me against my will?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe came over her, his knees straddling her hips, his large body caging hers to the bed. His teeth nipped her ear and his voice, low and angry, made her shiver all over. “I should have done this years ago. But I was lost in your charms and failed to see the signs. Even until this moment, I thought you so skittish that a gentle hand was necessary not to frighten you. Now I realize you need a good, hard riding to be broken properly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bastard!” Heart pounding, Elizabeth struggled beneath him. In response he sat on her, effectively crushing her protest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNimble fingers tugged at the fastenings to her skirts and bustle. Then his weight left her. Standing at the edge of the bed, Marcus yanked the garments down. She briefly considered rolling on her back to conceal her buttocks, clearly visible beneath the thinness of her chemise, but didn’t, deciding the front of her was far more needy of protection. “You won’t get away with this,” she warned. “You cannot keep me bound forever and when you release me, I’ll come after you. I’ll—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You won’t be able to walk,” he scoffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached for her boots and she lashed out at him, kicking with all her might. She screamed at the sudden sharp sting to her arse. The first spank was quickly followed by several more, each drop of his hand burning more than the last until she buried her face in the counterpane and cried with the pain of it. Only when she stopped flailing, and took the abuse without movement did he cease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your father should have taken you over his knee long ago,” he muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I hate you!” She turned her head to look at him, but couldn’t reach around far enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus’s sigh was loud and resigned. “You protest too much, love. You will thank me eventually. I’ve given you the freedom to enjoy me. You can fight all you want and still get what you desire. All the pleasure and none of the guilt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands cupped the flaming curves of her derriere and stroked gently, soothingly. The gentleness of his touch aroused her, the contrast startling after his previous treatment. “So beautiful. So soft and perfect.” His voice deepened, became cajoling. “Let yourself go, sweet. If you must be forced, why not relish the experience?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen his hands moved lower to the hem of her chemise and then slipped under it, she moaned in anticipation, her skin prickling with goosebumps at the feel of bare skin on bare skin. Her blood heated, her anger melting into something intoxicating as his thumbs moved higher, massaging either side of her lower back. Deep inside, her body softened at his skillful touch. The feel of air directly on her burning flesh coaxed a whimper of relief from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You would fight me to the death, my stubborn temptress, if you were able, but tied up for my needs brings unexpected rewards, does it not?” He rolled her to her back before gripping her shoulders and pulling her into a seated position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth bit her lower lip to hide the pout of disappointment she felt at the unwanted distance between them. Her nipples ached, peaked hard and tight, eager for the pinch of his fingers to ease their torment. Marcus’s dark green gaze narrowed on her flushed face. There was no tenderness, no sign of possible mercy, just stark intent and she knew he would not be swayed. Her stomach flipped as moisture pooled between her thighs at her helplessness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe assisted her to her feet and moved her to the nearby chair whose wooden arms curved so beautifully. Pressing her down to the seat, he then tugged his shirt from his breeches, before pulling it over his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth stared, arrested by his virility which was displayed so beautifully by rippling muscles beneath golden skin. His left shoulder was marred by a circular scar left by a bullet and silver ribbons on his flesh betrayed nicks from the sharp edge of a sword. As magnificent as he was, the sight of his past injuries reminded her that he was not meant for her. Even as her blood heated, her heart chilled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The agency has left its mark on you,” she said snidely. “It’s revolting.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus arched a dark brow. “That explains why you cannot take your eyes from me then.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeeved, she forced herself to look away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe crouched before her and cupped the backs of her knees, spreading her legs wide and hooking them over the carved arms of the chair. Her face heated in embarrassment as the damp lips of her sex were opened to his view. “Close the curtains.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrowning, he stared at the apex of her thighs. “God, no.” He brushed across her curls with his fingers. “Why would you wish to hide this? It’s heaven you hold here. A sight I’ve longed to see for far too long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please.” She squeezed her eyelids tightly together, her body tense and then trembling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Elizabeth. Look at me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears accompanied the lifting of her lids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are you so frightened? You know I would never hurt you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You leave me nothing, you take everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran a blunt fingertip through her cream and then dipped a bit inside. Against her will, she arched into the caress, despite the painful tension the angle placed on her arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You shared this with Hawthorne, but you won’t with me? Why?” His voice was rough and abrasive. “Why not me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer reply was shaky, betraying the depth of her distress. “My husband never saw me like this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wicked finger stilled, just barely entering her. “What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Such things are done at night. One must—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hawthorne made love to you in the darkness?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was a gentleman, one who—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was certifiable. Good God.” Marcus snorted and removed his finger. He stood. “To have you for his own, to fuck as he wished, and not appreciate your beauty? What a waste. The man was an idiot.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth lowered her head. “Our marriage was no different from any other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It was completely different than it would have been with me. How often?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How often?” she repeated dumbly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How often did he take you? Every night? Every few days?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What does it matter?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis nostrils flared on a deep breath, his frame taut beside her. Running an agitated hand through his hair, he was silent for a moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Release me, Marcus, and forget this.” Her shame was complete, there was no more he could do to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHard fingers lifted her chin to meet his gaze. “I’m going to touch you everywhere. With my hands, my mouth. In the light of day and long into the night. I’ll take you in whatever manner I choose, wherever I choose. I will know you as no one else in your life has known you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” She struggled again, completely at his mercy and unbearably aroused. Spread for him, she felt the emptiness inside her and hated how badly she needed him to fill it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I can. Because after today you will crave me and the pleasure I can give you. Because you’ll trust me, damn you.” He growled low in his throat. “All these years, married to him and then mourning him, when you could have been mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDropping to his knees, he held her hips and dropped his head. Elizabeth held her breath as he closed his mouth full upon her breast, soaking through the fabric of her shirt and chemise. Startled at first, she was soon moaning and arching her back in silent encouragement. Sharp pangs of sensation radiated outward, moving in rhythm with his suction, her womb contracting in spasms of need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus’s warm fingertips stroked from her waist to the ebony curls below. Painful tension seared her senses and Elizabeth gasped in surprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will touch you here,” he warned. “With my fingers, my tongue, my cock.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe bit her bottom lip, eyes wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You will enjoy it,” he promised, his thumb tugging her lip free from her teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You want to treat me like a whore. That is your revenge.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis smile was devoid of humor. “I want to give you pleasure, I want to hear you beg me for it. Why should you be deprived?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus stood and freed the placket of his breeches. Reaching inside, he withdrew his cock, and a heretofore unknown level of wanting had her writhing in the chair. He was long and thick, the head broad and dark with the blood that engorged it. He jerked his hand along the length and creamy moisture leaked from the tip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“See what the sight of you does to me, Elizabeth? How much power you wield? You are tied and helpless, yet it is I who is at your mercy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwallowing hard, her gaze was riveted to his display.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Trust, Elizabeth. You must trust me, in all ways.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up and ached at the sight of him. So beautiful, and yet harsh and rugged as only a man could be. “Is this about your mission?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is about us. You and me.” He stepped closer, and then closer still. “Open your mouth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?” Her lungs seized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Take me in your mouth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No …” She recoiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where is the minx who said she was not one to run from the sight of a man’s desire?” Marcus widened his stance until his powerful thighs bracketed the side of the chair and the glistening head of his cock rested directly before and slightly below her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is trust,” he whispered. “Think how you can hurt me, how vulnerable I am. You can bite me, love, and unman me. Or you can suckle me and bring me to my knees with pleasure. I ask this of you, knowing the risk, because I trust you. Just as I expect you to trust me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth stared at him, fascinated by the abrupt change in the balance between them. She met his eyes again and saw the longing there, the need. For now there was no bitterness. He looked so much as he had before, when they’d been promised to one another and free of past injuries. He was so breathtakingly handsome, appearing younger without the burden of his enmity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was that openness that decided her mind. Taking a deep breath, Elizabeth followed the urging of her heart and opened her mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 6\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarcus stood in an agony of lust as Elizabeth’s lips parted and she leaned forward to take him into her mouth. As she scalded him with wet heat, his breath hissed out between his teeth. His knees buckled and he gripped the high back of the chair with his free hand to remain upright. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ask-for-it-georgian-1/page-8.html","bookId":2658,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:09 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:09 AM"}
