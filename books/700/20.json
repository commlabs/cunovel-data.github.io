Why, it\u0027s the talk of the post, and everybody\u0027s laughing at us, and the plebes are getting bolder every minute. One of them actually dared to turn up his nose at me to-day.

Met one of the confounded beasts—that fellow, by the way, we did up, though it don\u0027t seem to have done him the least bit of good—just as B. J. as ever. You know who I mean, the rather handsome chap they call Dewey. He went to pass the color guard up at camp just now and he didn\u0027t raise his hat. The sentry called him down for it, and then as he went off I said to him: \u0027You ought to know better than that, plebe.\u0027 \u0027Thank you,\u0027 says he, and when I told him he should say \u0027sir\u0027 to a higher cadet, what on earth do you suppose he had the impudence to say?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What?\" inquired the crowd, eagerly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 166]\"Said he wouldn\u0027t do it because I hadn\u0027t said \u0027sir\u0027 to him!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, indeed!

The baby\u0027s sweet little brain, evolving the interesting problem, struck an idea which, so to speak, brought down the house.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I\u0027ll tell you what!\" he cried. \"I\u0027ve a scheme!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"What is it?\" inquired Bull, incredulously.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Let\u0027s soak him on demerits!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [Pg 168]And with a look of delight Bull turned and stared at Murray.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"By the lord!\" he cried, \"that\u0027s it.

A cadet is allowed to receive only one hundred \"demerits\" during the first six months of his stay. These demerits are assigned according to a regular and inflexible schedule; thus for being late at roll call, a minor offense, a cadet receives two demerits, while a serious offense, such as disobedience of orders or sitting down on post while on sentry duty, brings ten units of trouble in its wake. These demerits are not given by the instructor or the cadet who notices the of[Pg 169]fense; but he enters the charge in a book which is forwarded to headquarters. The report is read out after parade that same day and posted in a certain place the next day; and four days later the superintendent assigns the demerits in all cases where \"explanations\" have not been received.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The following is an example of an explanation:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"West Point, N.

But Bull and his gang saw[Pg 170] no obstacle in that; most of them were always head over heels in demerits themselves, including Murray—though he was a \"cadet-corporal.\" Being thus, and in consequent danger of expulsion, they were reckless of possible trouble. And besides, Bull had sworn to haze that plebe, and he meant to do it.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The plan in brief was simply this: Mark Mallory must be demerited right and left, everywhere and upon every possible pretext, just or unjust—and that was all. The thing has been done before; there is talk of doing it whenever a colored lad is admitted to the Point. And Murray was the man to do it, too, because he had just been transferred and put \"on duty over plebes.\" It was only necessary to give one hundred demerits. One hundred demerits is a ticket of leave without further parley or possibility of return.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3226/88093.html","bookId":700,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 7:16:32 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 7:16:32 AM"}
