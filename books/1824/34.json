She and Oliver had been asking her to move in with them ever since they were married, and they once again urged her to consider it. Allison loved being with Charlotte and Oliver, but she was preparing to enter Boston College, and they were moving to Seattle soon, so that option was off the table. Besides, the sense of responsibility still had a grip on her, holding her back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharlotte called their aunt and uncle toxic, and although Allison wholeheartedly agreed, she hadn\u0027t been able to get past the guilt. Every time her aunt called her ungrateful, she was reminding Allison of the sacrifice she had made by taking her and her sister into their home. For years Allison had heard how much money they had spent on the girls\u0027 expenses because Uncle Russell knew that was what his older brother would have wanted. Yes, they had spent a fortune on the girls, and what thanks did they get? Precious little, according to Aunt Jane. On and on the lectures continued until Allison was weighed down with guilt because she had been the burden that made her aunt\u0027s and uncle\u0027s lives less than perfect. Would she ever feel she\u0027d done enough to repay the debt she owed them? She honestly didn\u0027t know. What she did know was that for years her aunt and uncle had been using fear and guilt to get Allison to cooperate, and it was time for a change. She finally decided their criticism of her wasn\u0027t going to work any longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer aunt looked up from the page she was reading and, seeing Allison, motioned for her to come into the dining room. Allison pulled out a chair at the head of the table so that she wouldn\u0027t have to sit next to either one of them. Then she folded her hands in her lap and waited for them to start in on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer aunt held up the paper, which had a list of names with lines crossed through them. \"Do you see, Allison? These are the attorneys who have turned us down. They refused to take on Will\u0027s case. They all said the same thing: they couldn\u0027t do any better than Will\u0027s current attorney. No matter how much money we offered, they all said no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you liked Will\u0027s attorney. What\u0027s his name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stephen . . . Stephen Kelly,\" she said. \"And we did like him. He\u0027s done a good job until now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer uncle adjusted his glasses and looked up from his notepad. \"He\u0027s given up on Will and thinks my boy will have to go to prison this time. That\u0027s out of the question, of course. I can\u0027t let that happen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Jane nodded vigorously. \"No, we can\u0027t let that happen. Will is too . . . sensitive. And none of this is his fault.\" She added, \"We were able to get a copy of the video in the bar.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kelly got it for us,\" Uncle Russell interjected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer aunt insisted that Allison watch the video and pushed her laptop in front of her. In the beginning of the clip, it looked as though three men did crowd Will and threaten him, but Will threw the first punch . . . and the second . . . and the third. It was frightening to watch. When he became angry, he lost all control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will could have killed one of them,\" she whispered, shaken by what she\u0027d just seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Jane slapped the laptop shut and snatched it away from Allison. \"Will\u0027s the victim here. Get that straight,\" she snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlways the victim, Allison thought. She was amazed her aunt could look at the same video and come up with that conclusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Russell removed his glasses and pinched the bridge of his nose. \"This is going to be very expensive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No matter what it costs, we have to keep Will out of prison,\" Aunt Jane said. \"He couldn\u0027t handle it, and neither could we. What would our friends and neighbors think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUncle Russell became incensed. \"What do you care what the neighbors think?\" He picked up his glass and took a long swallow. \"Use your head for once. Keeping Will out of prison is all you should care about. Just how stupid are you?\" He snarled the question. \"You\u0027re more concerned about yourself than your own son.\"\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAunt Jane half lifted herself out of her chair. \"We have to live in this town,\" she shouted. \"And I always put Will first. How dare you say that I don\u0027t?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they were off on another fight. Whenever they started a squabble, Allison was always reminded of a horse race where the announcer talks faster and faster as the horses pound toward the home stretch. She wished she had her headphones now to block out the cacophony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe argument continued for a good five minutes before it wound down. Allison was even more determined now to tell them she\u0027d had enough. She was actually becoming a bit giddy thinking about never having to come back to this house again. It had never been her home. Never. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-34.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
