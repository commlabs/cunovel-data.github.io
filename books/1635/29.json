When the super- heated gas came in contact with the atmosphere inside the ships, plastic, flesh, and metal caught fire and roiled throughout their interiors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo of the targeted cruisers immediately detonated as the plasma beams found the reactors. Billowing clouds of vaporized metal mushroomed across the night and obscured her from the advancing ships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePinpricks of light appeared around Ascendant Justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eERROR.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCortana rechecked the figures and quickly found the source of the problem: The fail-safe subroutine that tracked local gravita- tional conditions returned an anomaly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gravity from Reach no longer warped space ... which was impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo time for speculation. She had to leave or fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved Ascendant Justice into the twisting spatial field— —and vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of the nonvisible nondimensions of Slipspace, how- ever, a blue-tinged field appeared on Cortana\u0027s monitors. It wasn\u0027t space—not the crowded space near Reach, or the star-filled space of the Epsilon Eridani system. But it was a space, where there should have been no space at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe probed the region with her sensors, but her range was lim- ited to a thousand kilometers as if she were in an obscuring fog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere—a contact. And another. And then a dozen more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFourteen Covenant cruisers resolved from the blue mist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cortana,\" the Master Chief said. \"What\u0027s our status?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same as ever,\" Cortana replied. \"We\u0027re in trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Covenant warships fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn,\" Cortana muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe initiated her last option: She fired back, hoping to take some of them to hell with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER TWENTY-THREE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTIME:DATE RECORD [[ERROR]]ANOMALY\\Date\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunknown\\ Aboard captured Covenant flagship Ascendant Justice, in Slipspace. Now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cortana?\" the Master Chief asked. \"What\u0027s our status?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chief and the rest of his team scrambled out of the Cove- nant dropship. Fred carried a semiconscious Kelly out and laid her on the deck of the launch bay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same as ever,\" Cortana replied. \"We\u0027re in trouble.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVideo feed from the ship\u0027s external cameras appeared on the Master Chief\u0027s heads-up display. Covenant cruisers surrounded them, their plasma turrets aglow; they reminded the Chief of pictures he had seen of fish that lived at the bottom of Earth\u0027s oceans—swarms of phosphorescing lights and razor-sharp teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe marched toward the edge of the launch bay and stood a centimeter from where the ship\u0027s energy shield abutted the open- ing to the space beyond. He looked directly into the vast blue fields and the giant warships far too close for his liking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We jumped to Slipspace, didn\u0027t we?\" Lieutenant Haverson asked uncertainly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" Dr. Halsey replied. \"And no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe withdrew the crystal from her lab coat pocket and frowned as she discovered that it was no longer a slender shard. The facets had rearranged like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle... but in a configuration that differed from the one the artifact displayed in the Covenant grav beam. This time it was a starburst of edges and refracted light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We jumped,\" she said, examining her reflection in the arti-fact\u0027s mirrored planes. \"But not to the Slipspace we know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief\u0027s radiation counter clicked and a shrill alarm screamed through his helmet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Secure that, Anton,\" he said and nodded toward the glowing stone. \"Get it into the reactor compartment of the Pelican.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnton relieved the crystal from Dr. Halsey, who only reluc- tantly released it from her grasp. He sprinted toward the wrecked Pelican.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was a radiation surge, Doctor,\" the Chief explained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And that thing is the source.\" The Chief noticed that the intensity of the radiation did not drop off as Anton moved it into the Pelican.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever it is,\" Dr. Halsey said as she scrutinized the blue field outside their ship, \"it warps space. When we first approached it in the great room, space curled around the crystal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd again in the grav beam, it dispersed that field potential.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And now?\" Admiral Whitcomb asked. \"This tiling is affect-ing our passage through Slipspace?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apparently so,\" Dr. Halsey said, and stepped next to John to get a better look outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Admiral joined her and watched as the Covenant ships\u0027 turrets heated. \"Can they even fire those things in Slipspace? If they can, we\u0027re sitting ducks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief could make out more ships in the distance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Covenant vessels flickered, faded, disappeared, and then reappeared in the fog. The nearest enemy Covenant ships fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmorphous balls of superheated gas belched from their turrets and accelerated toward them, tingeing the blue space purple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief saw Locklear as he helped Polaski out of the Covenant dropship. He kept her hand in his, and they watched together as the plasma sped toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe balls of plasma streaked on—then curled and spiraled off their trajectories. Several simply winked out of existence, only to reappear somewhere else. The enemy shots raced up, down, sideways—any direction but toward Ascendant Justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What the hell is this?\" Sergeant Johnson said and he stepped next to the Master Chief to watch the display. \"I didn\u0027t think their ships could fire in Slipspace. Ours sure as hell can\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Halsey removed her glasses, and her eyes widened. \"Nor- mally, they can\u0027t. If they can fire, then logically, we\u0027re not in Slipspace. And wherever we are,\" she murmured, \"the rules have changed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Admiral frowned. \"Cortana,\" he shouted. \"Whatever you do, do not return—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo late. Cortana returned fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColumns of fire streaked from Ascendant Justice—streamers that twisted and helixed, then vanished and reappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bubble of tangled blue space containing Ascendant Jus- tice and the Covenant warships now contained at least forty bolts of superheated plasma circling in random directions and accelerated to incalculable velocities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree spheres of roiling fire appeared in front of the nearest Covenant cruiser and splashed across its bow. The first boiled away its shimmering silver shield; the second and third melted the armor and alloy skin beneath. Atmosphere vented and spun the massive ship like a child\u0027s pinwheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hot damn,\" Sergeant Johnson crowed. \"All we have to do is wait for those trigger-happy bastards to take themselves out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook, they\u0027re firing again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Covenant weapons heated and squeezed out a second salvo of plasma. The guided bolts of fire veered off course, swarmed, disappeared, reappeared, and spun out of control though the local- ized Slipspace bubble.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Sergeant,\" Dr. Halsey said, her voice turning cold. \"We\u0027re all in the same mess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cortana,\" the Master Chief said, \"drop the launch bay blast door. Now!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three-meter-thick door overhead shuddered and slid down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA streamer of plasma on a parallel trajectory flashed through the dark not half a kilometer from the Master Chief\u0027s face—so close that the external temperature rose twenty degrees even through the ship\u0027s shields.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRed fire illuminated Ascendant Justice\u0027s starboard shield as plasma splashed across them; the film separating the launch bay from the external vacuum rippled like a thousand broken mir- rors. Static crackled across the Master Chief\u0027s armor, and his shields resonated in sympathy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the blast door lowered, the Chief saw another fireball spill across their port side. Energy sprayed across the bow in a blood red borealis. Ascendant Justice\u0027s shields flickered and faded...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebut they held. Barely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe launch bay door touched the deck and sealed with a sub- sonic thud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Blast door locked and secured,\" Cortana announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s get this boat under way,\" Admiral Whitcomb barked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"While we still have a boat.\" He looked around and frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chief, lead the way to the bridge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\" He marched to the passage that led deeper into the alien ship. His Spartans and the rest of the crew followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdmiral Whitcomb turned to Dr. Halsey. \"Catherine, explain in layman\u0027s terms just what the hell is going on here. If we can see those cruisers and they can see us, why aren\u0027t our shots connecting?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAscendant Justice rolled to port, and explosions chained overhead. The artificial gravity fluttered, and the deck tilted. The crew stumbled, and Dr. Halsey fell to the deck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Turrets one and seven destroyed,\" Cortana announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhitcomb helped Dr. Halsey up off her knees. She glanced nervously up and down the passage. \"I\u0027d guess the alien artifact we\u0027ve brought with us into Slipspace has expanded the region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePhysicists believe Slipstream space is a highly compressed ver- sion of normal space, layered over and under itself, like a ball of yarn. Now, imagine that our ball of yarn\"—she interlaced her ringers—\"is looped and knotted. These threads are not solid, however; plasma, light, and matter jump from one thread to an- other given the slightest quantum fluctuation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If that\u0027s the case, Doctor,\" Lieutenant Haverson said, \"then what about our ship? Why aren\u0027t we tangled and spread along a trillion alternate spatial pathways?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because of the mass of this ship.\" She pushed her glasses higher onto her nose. \"Imagine a rumpled sheet that represents this space. If you set a heavy mass upon that sheet, it draws it taut, smooths it out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Chief came to the heavy bulkhead door and held up his hand, telling the rest of them to halt. He opened the door and stepped onto the bridge, sweeping the space with his rifle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clear,\" he told them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdmiral Whitcomb and the others entered the bridge. Lieu- tenant Haverson stepped onto the raised platform and said, \"Cortana, project tactical on the displays.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnemy ship positions and plasma tracks appeared on the inte- rior walls. Contacts multiplied and coalesced, making the plasma appear like waves sloshing about in a bowl. Another bolt broke across the prow of Ascendant Justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the deck the Master Chief felt the successive thumps of explosive decompressions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hit on subengineering decks,\" Cortana said. \"Sealing those regions. Fire in the lower levels. Attempting to isolate and pump out the atmosphere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJohn\u0027s childhood AI teacher, Deja, had taught the Spartans about the great Naval battles on Earth\u0027s oceans before humans traveled to the stars. They had studied victories in the Punic Wars, and at Midway, as well as the disastrous defeat of Xerxes by the Athenian Navy. Deja had told them, however, that one thing was greater than any human enemy on the sea: nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTidal waves and typhoons could crush the mightiest of battle- ships ... and ignored the tactics of the most brilliant captain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAscendant Justice was in the center of a sea of fire ... and it was being battered apart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThunder ripped through Ascendant Justice\u0027s hull; a geyser of flames shot out the passageway to the bridge. The air jumped and hissed as it escaped the pressurized chamber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bulkhead door slammed shut, and the air stilled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSergeant Johnson shook his head clear from the sudden drop in pressure. \"Let\u0027s drop out of this mixed-up Slipspace and start fighting.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, or just get rid of that crystal,\" Locklear said. \"If it\u0027s the cause of all this mess.\" He drew his pistol. \"One round and boom! Problem solved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t do that!\" Dr. Halsey snapped. \"A drop back to normal space has us facing a dozen or more cruisers. And if you destroy the crystal, the expanded Slipspace bubble we\u0027re in would in- stantly collapse. Every separate mass in the bubble will compact into a single mass. We wouldn\u0027t survive the transition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorry creased Admiral Whitcomb\u0027s features. \"That leaves just one option. Cortana, give me flank speed and heat up every weapon we have. We\u0027re going to run right over these Covenant ships. Tangled space or not, we\u0027re going to blast them right back to normal space from point-blank range.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Admiral,\" Cortana said. \"Engines answering flank speed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA dull thump echoed from the aft section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stand by,\" Cortana said. \"There\u0027s a problem with the primary engines—a power drop occurred just as I engaged.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the bridge displays the external cameras turned and focused on the aft hull of Ascendant Justice. A snakelike plasma conduit came into focus. Cortana adjusted the image, and a three-meter-wide hole in the conduit snapped into view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStreamers of blue-white gas vented from the breach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s our main drive conduit,\" Cortana said. \"It\u0027s taken a hit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m shutting down engines to conserve power.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Master Chief squinted. \"That was no plasma hit,\" he muttered. \"It was too precise and too inconvenient—this had to be sabotage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdmiral Whitcomb scowled. \"Chief, take your team and pre- pare for a zero-gee repair of the plasma conduit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolaski stepped forward. \"I\u0027ll go too, sir,\" she said. Locklear grasped her by the arm and tried to pull her back, but she shrugged his hand off. \"I can pilot the dropship—get the Spartan team in and out faster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Admiral narrowed his eyes, assessing the young woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very well, Warrant Officer.\" He added so softly that the Chief almost missed it: \"Too many damned heroes in this war.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolaski turned to Locklear, handed him back his bandanna, and whispered, \"Hang on to that for me, Corporal. I\u0027ll pick it up when I get back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocklear\u0027s hand clenched, then relaxed. He took the token, nodded, and looked away. \"I\u0027ll be here,\" he said and tied it around his arm. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/halo-first-strike-halo-3/page-29.html","bookId":1635,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:01 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:01 PM"}
