There was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ealso some dirty patio furniture and other odds and ends. But the main feature was a small structure that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esat on the roof the way a house sits on a street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead\u0027s home. The penthouse. It was as stark and unlovely as the rest of the building, but it had a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egreat view and it was completely private. There were no other tall buildings nearby to look down on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez moved stealthily toward the door. Her feet made no noise on the pitted asphalt of the roof, and she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas in a state of almost painfully heightened awareness. In the old days sneaking up on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanother gang member had been a game. You got to laugh at them if you could startle them, and they got\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto be furious and humiliated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday it wasn\u0027t a game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez started toward the warped wooden door-then stopped. Doors were trouble. Morgead would have\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebeen an idiot not to have rigged it to alert him to intruders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCat-quiet, she headed instead for a narrow metal ladder that led to the roof of the wooden structure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow she was on the real top of the building. The only thing higher was a metal flagpole without a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved noiselessly across the new roof. At the far edge she found herself looking four stories straight\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edown. And directly below her there was a window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn open window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez smiled tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she hooked her toes over the four-inch lip at the edge of the roof and dropped gracefully forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe grabbed the top of the window in mid-dive and hung suspended, defying gravity like a bat attached\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eupside down. She looked inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there he was. Lying on a futon, asleep. He was sprawled on his back, fully clothed in jeans, high\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eboots, and a leather jacket. He looked good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust like the old days, Jez thought. When the gang would stay out all night riding their bikes and hunting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eor fighting or partying, and then come home in the morning to scramble into clothes for school. Except\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead, who would smirk at them\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand then collapse. He didn\u0027t have parents or relatives to keep him from skipping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m surprised he\u0027s not wearing his helmet, too, she thought, pulling herself back up to the roof. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epicked up the fighting stick, maneuvered it into the window, then let herself down again, this time hanging\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eby her hands. She slid in without making a noise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she went to stand over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hadn\u0027t changed. He looked exactly as she remembered, except younger and more vulnerable\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebecause he was asleep. His face was pale, making his dark hair seem even darker. His lashes were black\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecrescents on his cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvil and dangerous, Jez reminded herself. It annoyed her that she had to remind herself of what\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead was. For some reason her mind was throwing pictures at her, scenes from her childhood while\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe was living here in San Francisco with her Uncle Bracken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA five-year-old Jez, with shorter red hair that looked as if it had never been combed, walking with a little\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egrimy-faced Morgead, hand in hand. An eight-year-old Jez with two skinned knees, scowling as a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebusinesslike Morgead pulled wood splinters out of her legs with rusty tweezers. A seven-year-old\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead with his face lit up in astonishment as Jez persuaded him to try the human thing called ice\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecream....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStop it, Jez told her brain flatly. You might as well give up, because it\u0027s no good. We were friends\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethen-well, some of the time-but we\u0027re enemies\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enow. He\u0027s changed. I\u0027ve changed. He\u0027d kill me in a second now if it would suit his purpose. And I\u0027m\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egoing to do what has to be done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe backed up and poked him lightly with the stick. \"Morgead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes flew open and he sat up. He was awake instantly, like any vampire, and he focused on her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewithout a trace of confusion. Jez had changed her grip on the stick and was standing ready in case he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewent straight into an attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut instead, a strange expression crossed his face. It went from startled recognition into something Jez\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edidn\u0027t understand. For a moment he was simply staring at her, eyes big, chest heaving, looking as if he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewere caught in between pain and happiness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he said quietly, \"Jez.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Morgead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You came back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez shifted the stick again. \"Apparently.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe got up in one motion. \"Where the hell have you been?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow he just looked furious, Jez noted. Which was easier to deal with, because that was how she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eremembered him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t tell you,\" she said, which was perfectly true, and would also annoy the life out of him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt did. He shook his head to get dark hair out of his eyes-it was always disheveled in the morning, Jez\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eremembered-and glared at her. He was standing easily: not in any attack posture, but with the relaxed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereadiness that meant he could go flying in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eany direction at any moment. Jez kept half her mind on watching his leg muscles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t tell me? You disappear one day without any kind of warning, without even leaving a note...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyou leave the gang and me and just completely vanish and nobody knows where to find you, not even\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyour uncle .. . and now you reappear again and you can\u0027t tell me where you were?\" He was working\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehimself into one of his Extremely Excited States, Jez realized. She was surprised; she\u0027d expected him to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estay cooler and attack hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you think you were doing, just cutting out on everybody? Did it ever occur to you that people\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewould be worried about you? That people would think you were dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t occur to me that anyone would care, Jez thought, startled. Especially not you. But she couldn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esay that. \"Look, I didn\u0027t mean to hurt anybody. And I can\u0027t talk about why I went. But I\u0027m back now-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t just come back!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez was losing her calm. Nothing was going the way she\u0027d expected; the things she\u0027d scripted out to say\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eweren\u0027t getting said. \"I know I can\u0027t just come back-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because it doesn\u0027t work that way!\" Morgead was pacing now, tossing hair out of his eyes again as he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eturned to glare at her. \"Blood in, blood out. Since you\u0027re apparently not dead, you abandoned us. You\u0027re\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enot allowed to do that! And you certainly can\u0027t expect to just walk back in and become my second\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eagain-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t!\" Jez yelled. She had to shut him up. \"I have no intention of becoming your\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esecond-in-command!\" she said when he finally paused. \"I came to challenge you as leader.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead\u0027s jaw dropped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez let her breath out. That wasn\u0027t exactly how she\u0027d planned to say it. But now, seeing his shock, she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efelt more in control. She leaned casually against the wall, smiled at him, and said smoothly, \u0027I was leader\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhen I left, remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You... have got to be ... joking.\" Morgead stared at her. \"You expect to waltz back in here as\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eleader?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If I can beat you. I think I can. I did it once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared for another minute, seeming beyond words. Then he threw back his head and laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a scary sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he looked at her again, his eyes were bright and hard. \"Yeah, you did. I\u0027ve gotten better since\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethen.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez said three words. \"So have I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd with that, everything changed. Morgead shifted position-only slightly, but he was now in a fighting\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estance. Jez felt adrenaline flow through her own body. The challenge had been issued and accepted;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethere was nothing more to say. They were now facing each other ready to fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd this she could deal with. She was much better at fighting than at playing with words. She knew\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead in this mood; his pride and his skill had been questioned and he was now absolutely determined\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto win. This was very familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout taking his eyes from her, he reached out and picked a fighting stick from the rack behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJapanese oak, Jez noted. Heavy, well-seasoned, resilient. Good choice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fire-hardened end was very pointy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wouldn\u0027t try to use that first, though. First, he would go for disarming her. The simplest way to do this\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas to break the wrist of her dominant hand. After that he\u0027d go for critical points and nerve centers. He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edidn\u0027t play around at this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA minute change in Morgead\u0027s posture alerted her, and then they were both moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swung his stick up and down in a perfect arc, aiming for her right wrist. Jez blocked easily with her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eown stick and felt the shock as wood clashed with wood. She instantly changed her grip and tried for a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etrap, but he whipped his stick out of the way and was facing her again as if he\u0027d never moved in the first\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smiled at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027s right. He\u0027s gotten better. A small chill went through Jez, and for the first time she worried about her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eability to beat him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause I have to do it without killing him, she thought. She wasn\u0027t at all sure he had the same concern\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout not killing her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re so predictable, Morgead,\" she told him. \"I could fight you in my sleep.\" She feinted toward his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewrist and then tried to sweep his legs out from underneath him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blocked and tried for a trap. \"Oh, yeah? And you hit like a four-year-old. You couldn\u0027t take me\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edown if I stood here and let you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey circled each other warily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe snakewood stick was warm in Jez\u0027s hands. It was funny, some distant part of her mind thought\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eirrelevantly, how the most humble and lowly of human weapons was the most dangerous to vampires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was also the most versatile weapon in the world. With a stick, unlike a knife or gun or sword, you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould fine-tune the degree of pain and injury you caused. You could disarm and control attackers, and-if\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe circumstances required it-you could inflict pain without permanently injuring them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course if they were vampires, you could also kill them, which you couldn\u0027t do with a knife or gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly wood could stop the vampire heart permanently, which was why the fighting stick was the weapon\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof choice for vampires who wanted to hurt each other... and for vampire hunters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez grinned at Morgead, knowing it was not a particularly nice smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer feet whispered across the worn oak boards of the floor. She and Morgead had practiced here\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecountless times, measuring themselves against each other, training themselves to be the best. And it had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eworked. They were both masters of this most deadly weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no fight had ever mattered as much as this one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next you\u0027re going to try for a head strike,\" she informed Morgead coolly. \"Because you always do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think you know everything. But you don\u0027t know me anymore. I\u0027ve changed,\" he told her, just as\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecalmly-and went for a head strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Psyche,\" he said as she blocked it and wood clashed with a sharp whack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wrong.\" Jez twisted her stick sharply, got leverage on his, and whipped it down, holding it against his\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eupper thighs. \"Trap.\" She grinned into his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd was startled for a moment. She hadn\u0027t been this close to him in a long time. His eyes-they were so\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egreen, gem-colored, and full of strange light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor just an instant neither of them moved; then-weapons down, their gazes connected. Their faces were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eso close their breath mingled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Morgead slipped out of the trap. \"Don\u0027t try that stuff,\" he said nastily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What stuff?\" The moment her stick was free of his, she snapped it up again, reversing her grip and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethrusting toward his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know what stuff!\" He deflected her thrust with unnecessary force. \"That I\u0027m Jez and I\u0027m so wild\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand beautiful\u0027 stuff. That \u0027Why don\u0027t you just drop your stick and let me hit you because it\u0027ll be fun\u0027 stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Morgead... what are you... talking about?\" In between the words she attacked, a strike to his throat\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand then one to his temple. He blocked and evaded-which was just what she wanted. Evasion. Retreat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was crowding him into a corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the only way you won before. Trying to play on people\u0027s feelings for you. Well, it won\u0027t work\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanymore!\" He countered viciously, but it didn\u0027t matter. Jez blocked with a whirlwind of strikes of her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eown, pressing him, and then he had no choice but to retreat until his back was against the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had no idea what he meant about playing on people\u0027s feelings, and she didn\u0027t have time to think\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout it. Morgead was dangerous as a wounded tiger when he was cornered. His eyes were glowing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eemerald green with sheer fury, and there was a hardness to his features that hadn\u0027t been there last year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe does hate me, Jez thought. Hugh was wrong. He\u0027s hurt and angry and he absolutely hates me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe textbook answer was to use that emotion against him, to provoke him and get him so mad that he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egave her an opening. Some instinct deep inside Jez was worried about that, but she didn\u0027t listen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey, all\u0027s fair, right?\" she told him softly. \"And what do you mean, it won\u0027t work? I\u0027ve got you, haven\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI?\" She flashed out a couple of quick attacks, more to keep him occupied than anything else. \"You\u0027re\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecaught, and you\u0027re going to have to let down your guard sometime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe green eyes that had been luminous with fury suddenly went cold. The color of glacier ice. \"Unless I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edo something unexpected,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing you do is unexpected,\" she said sweetly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut her mind was telling her that provoking him had been a mistake. She had hit some nerve, and he was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estronger than he\u0027d been a year ago. He didn\u0027t lose his temper under pressure the way he\u0027d used to. He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejust got more determined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose green eyes unnerved her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMove in hard, she thought. All out. Go for a pressure point. Numb his arm-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut before she could do anything, a wave of Power hit her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt sent her reeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d never felt anything exactly like it. It came from Morgead, a Shockwave of telepathic energy that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estruck her like a physical thing. It knocked her back two steps and made her struggle for balance. It left\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe air crackling with electricity and a faint smell of ozone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez\u0027s mind spun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow had he done that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not hard,\" Morgead said in a calm, cold voice that went with his eyes. He was out of the corner by\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enow, of course. For a moment Jez thought he was reading her thoughts, but then she realized her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003equestion must be written all over her face. \u0027It\u0027s something I discovered after you left,\" he went on. \"All it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etakes is practice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0027re telepathic, Jez thought. Which I\u0027m not anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Night People are getting stronger, developing more powers, she thought. Well, Hugh had been right\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon that one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she was in trouble now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhack! That was Morgead going for a side sweep. He\u0027d noticed her lack of balance. Jez countered\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eautomatically, but her head wasn\u0027t clear and her body was ringing with pain. He\u0027d shaken her, distracted\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As you said, all\u0027s fair,\" Morgead said, with a small, cold smile on his lips. \"You have your weapons. I\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he threw another of those Shockwaves at her. Jez was better braced for it now, but it still\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erocked her on her feet, took her attention off her weapon-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust long enough for her to screw up and let him in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe drove upward to catch her stick from below. Then he twisted, sweeping her stick in a circle, forcing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher off balance again, trying to topple her backward. As Jez fought to recover, he struck to her elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWham!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a different sound from the crisp whack when wood hit wood. This was softer, duller, the sound of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewood hitting flesh and bone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez heard her own involuntary gasp of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFire shot up her arm, into her shoulder, and for a moment she lost her grip on the stick with her right\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehand. She forced her fingers to close on it again, but they were numb. She couldn\u0027t feel what she was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t block properly with one arm useless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Morgead was advancing, that deadly cold\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elight in his eyes. Absolutely merciless. His movements were relaxed and easy; he knew exactly what he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo more whacks and he got through her guard again. The oak stick slammed into her ribs and she felt\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanother wave of sickening pain. Gray dots danced in front of her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFractured? Jez wondered briefly. She hoped not. Vampires could break each other\u0027s ribs in fun and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eknow that everything would heal in a day or two. But Jez wouldn\u0027t recover like that. Morgead might kill\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher without even meaning to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t let him keep striking her-but she couldn\u0027t retreat, either. If he got her into a corner, she\u0027d be\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhack-wham. He got her on the knee. Pain sparked up and down her leg, lighting every nerve. She had\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eno choice but to back up. He was crowding her relentlessly, forcing her to the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMorgead flashed a smile at her. Not the cold smile. This one was brilliant, and very familiar to Jez. It\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emade him look devastatingly handsome, and it meant that he was in absolute command of the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can give up anytime, now,\" he said. \"Because I\u0027m going to win and we both know it.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-huntress-night-world-7/page-7.html","bookId":1863,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:36 PM"}
