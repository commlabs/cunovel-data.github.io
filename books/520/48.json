{"id":44714,"no":48,"title":"9th November","content":"Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I started down town today to buy a bottle of shoe blacking and some\n\u003cbr\u003e collars and the material for a new blouse and a jar of violet cream\n\u003cbr\u003e and a cake of Castile soap--all very necessary; I couldn\u0027t be happy\n\u003cbr\u003e another day without them--and when I tried to pay the car fare,\n\u003cbr\u003e I found that I had left my purse in the pocket of my other coat. \n\u003cbr\u003e So I had to get out and take the next car, and was late for gymnasium.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It\u0027s a dreadful thing to have no memory and two coats!\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Julia Pendleton has invited me to visit her for the Christmas holidays. \n\u003cbr\u003e How does that strike you, Mr. Smith? Fancy Jerusha Abbott,\n\u003cbr\u003e of the John Grier Home, sitting at the tables of the rich. \n\u003cbr\u003e I don\u0027t know why Julia wants me--she seems to be getting quite\n\u003cbr\u003e attached to me of late. I should, to tell the truth, very much\n\u003cbr\u003e prefer going to Sallie\u0027s, but Julia asked me first, so if I\n\u003cbr\u003e go anywhere it must be to New York instead of to Worcester. \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m rather awed at the prospect of meeting Pendletons EN MASSE,\n\u003cbr\u003e and also I\u0027d have to get a lot of new clothes--so, Daddy dear,\n\u003cbr\u003e if you write that you would prefer having me remain quietly at college,\n\u003cbr\u003e I will bow to your wishes with my usual sweet docility.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m engaged at odd moments with the Life and Letters of Thomas Huxley--\n\u003cbr\u003e it makes nice, light reading to pick up between times. Do you know\n\u003cbr\u003e what an archaeopteryx is? It\u0027s a bird. And a stereognathus? \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m not sure myself, but I think it\u0027s a missing link, like a bird\n\u003cbr\u003e with teeth or a lizard with wings. No, it isn\u0027t either; I\u0027ve just\n\u003cbr\u003e looked in the book. It\u0027s a mesozoic mammal.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027ve elected economics this year--very illuminating subject. \n\u003cbr\u003e When I finish that I\u0027m going to take Charity and Reform; then,\n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Trustee, I\u0027ll know just how an orphan asylum ought to be run. \n\u003cbr\u003e Don\u0027t you think I\u0027d make an admirable voter if I had my rights? \n\u003cbr\u003e I was twenty-one last week. This is an awfully wasteful country to\n\u003cbr\u003e throw away such an honest, educated, conscientious, intelligent citizen\n\u003cbr\u003e as I would be.\n\u003cbr\u003e Yours always,\n\u003cbr\u003e Judy\n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2106/59770.html","bookId":520,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 7:56:04 AM"}
