Sara took a deep breath and tried again. She waved her hand toward the pirate\u0027s leader and said, \"That man has suffered enough.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Sara,\" Matthew interjected with a grin. \"He\u0027ll be thinking of you every time he\u0027s wanting to blow his nose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA hearty round of laughter followed that remark. Then Chester took a threatening step forward. His hands were on his h*ps when he bellowed, \"He won\u0027t be thinking about anything much longer. None of them will. They\u0027ll all be fish bait if the vote goes the way I\u0027m thinking it will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vehemence in his tone unnerved Sara. She instinctively backed away from him until she was literally leaning against her husband\u0027s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan couldn\u0027t see her face, but he knew she was afraid. Without a thought as to why he was doing so he put his arm across her shoulders. She rested her chin on his wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis touch had taken her fear away. She glared at Chester and said, \"Were you born with a sour disposition, sir?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe seaman didn\u0027t have a ready answer for that question and shrugged in reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right, then,\" Sara shouted. \"Have your vote.\" She pushed Nathan\u0027s arm away and took a step forward. \"Just remember this,\" she hastily added when the hands shot back up in the air. \"I\u0027m going to be very disappointed if any of you vote in favor of death. Very disappointed,\" she added in a dramatic tone of voice. \"If, on the other hand, you vote to toss the villains overboard and let them swim back to their ship, I would be very pleased. Does everyone understand my position?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scanned her audience until each man had given her a nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s it?\" Nathan asked. He sounded incredulous. \"That\u0027s all you have to say to sway the men?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe actually smiled at her. She smiled back. \"Yes, Nathan. You may vote now. I don\u0027t think you should be allowed to vote, though.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" he asked before he could stop himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because you aren\u0027t thinking straight now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe look on his face told her he didn\u0027t understand. \"You see, Nathan, you\u0027re still very angry because… your dear wife was injured.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My dear wife?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave him a disgruntled look. \"Me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGod, she was exasperating. \"I know who the hell my wife is,\" he grumbled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just leave it to your crew to decide,\" she prodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe agreed just to get her to leave. Sara forced a smile when she picked up her skirt and strolled toward the steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay inside your cabin, Sara, until this is finished,\" Matthew ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could feel every man\u0027s gaze on her. She knew they were all waiting until she was out of sight before going forward with their shameful intentions. Jimbo had even closed the trapdoor to her cabin, she noticed, probably so that the horrid noise wouldn\u0027t reach her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t feel at all guilty for what she was about to do. Her motives were as white as fresh snow. She couldn\u0027t let her staff murder the pirates, no matter how dastardly their behavior had been; and once her men rid themselves of their anger they\u0027d be thankful she\u0027d intervened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara stopped when she reached the top step. She didn\u0027t turn around. Her voice was very pleasant when she called out to her husband. \"Nathan? I won\u0027t be waiting in the cabin, but do send someone to tell me how the voting went. I want to know if I should be disappointed or not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan frowned over that odd request. He knew she was up to something, but he couldn\u0027t imagine what she could possibly do to sway the men\u0027s minds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where will you be waiting, m\u0027lady?\" Jimbo called out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara turned around so that she could see their expressions when she gave her answer. \"I\u0027ll be waiting in the galley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t take most of the men any time at all to catch her meaning. They looked horrified. Nathan, she noticed, was grinning at her. She glared back. Then she addressed her staff. \"I didn\u0027t want to have to resort to such tactics, men, but you\u0027ve left me with no alternative. The vote had better not disappoint me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few of the less astute seamen still didn\u0027t understand the hidden threat. Chester fell into that group. \"What would you be doing in the galley, m\u0027lady?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer answer was immediate. \"Making soup.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Ten\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vote was unanimous. No one wanted Sara to be disappointed. The pirates were tossed overboard and allowed to swim back to their ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan did have the last word, however, or rather the last action. He ordered two cannons made ready and took great satisfaction in putting a large hole in the pirates\u0027 vessel. When Sara asked what the noise was he told her they were simply emptying the cannons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Seahawk had suffered damage as well. Most of the repairs that needed to be seen to at once were above the water line. The very same sails Sara had nearly destroyed with her parasol had been sliced in half by one of the enemy\u0027s cannon shots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crew set about righting as much of the damage as possible. They smiled as they worked—a rarity—and every one of them had tossed his necklace of garlic cloves away. They were feeling safe again, for they believed the curse had been removed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir mistress had saved their hides. Why, even sour-tempered Chester was singing her praises.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara went with Matthew to fetch Nora from the hold, and it wasn\u0027t until the hatch was opened that she remembered the captives trapped below. Nathan waited until Sara had turned to leave the deck, then slammed his fist into the midsection of each man. The loud groans caught Sara\u0027s attention, yet when she turned around and asked her husband what the awful noise was he simply shrugged at her and then graciously helped the doubled-over captives to take flight over the rail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara took great delight in retelling the sequence of events to Nora. Her aunt was an appreciative audience of one. She praised her niece for her courage and her cunning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I cannot let you believe I was completely courageous,\" Sara confessed. She stood with her aunt in the middle of the wardroom area. She\u0027d already shown Nora where she\u0027d hidden behind the screen. \"I was terrified all the while,\" she added with a nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That doesn\u0027t signify,\" Nora countered. \"You helped your husband. It means all the more because you were afraid and yet you didn\u0027t fail him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know Nathan hasn\u0027t said a word of praise to me?\" Sara said. \"I hadn\u0027t realized that until this very minute. You would think—\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would think he hasn\u0027t had time to say thank you, Sara, and I doubt he will when he does have the time. He\u0027s a bit…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stubborn?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNora smiled. \"No, dear, not stubborn, just proud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara decided he was a little of both. The rush of excitement was over, but Sara\u0027s hands started shaking. She felt sick to her stomach, too, and the side of her face was throbbing quite painfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wasn\u0027t going to worry Nora, though, and so she kept her aches and pains to herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you\u0027ve heard the whispers comparing you to Nathan\u0027s sister,\" Nora said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hadn\u0027t heard any such whispers, but she pretended she had just so that her aunt would continue. Sara nodded and said, \"Jade was mistress of this vessel for a long while, and the men were very loyal to her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know their comments must have hurt your feelings, child,\" Nora said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which comments are you referring to?\" Sara asked. \"I\u0027ve heard so many.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, that you cry all the time,\" Nora answered. \"Jade never cried. She kept her emotions under lock and key, or so Matthew likes to boast. She was extremely courageous, too. I\u0027ve heard such wonderful stories about the feats she and her men accomplished. But you\u0027ve heard all that,\" Nora continued with a wave of her hand. \"I\u0027m not bringing up this topic to make you think the men still believe you inferior, Sara. No, quite the opposite is the case now. Why, you\u0027ve won their hearts and their loyalty today. They won\u0027t be making comparisons in future, I\u0027ll wager. They\u0027ve seen you\u0027re every bit as courageous as their Jade.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara turned to go into her cabin. \"I believe I\u0027ll have a little rest, Aunt,\" she whispered. \"The excitement has worn me out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You do look pale, Sara. It was quite a morning, wasn\u0027t it? I believe I\u0027ll go find Matthew and, if he isn\u0027t too busy, spend a few minutes with him. Then I\u0027m going to have a rest, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara\u0027s light blue walking dress was on the floor of the cabin. As soon as she shut the door behind her and spotted the gown she remembered how the infidel had clutched it in his arms. She remembered all the foul words they\u0027d said, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was finally settling in. The realization of what could have happened made her stomach lurch. \"I mustn\u0027t think about all the possibilities,\" she whispered to herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan could have been killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara unbuttoned her gown and took the garment off. Her petticoats, shoes, and stockings came next. She was excruciatingly exact with her task. Her gaze kept returning to the gown on the floor, though, and she couldn\u0027t block the memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d really meant to kill her husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara decided she needed something to do to take her mind off her fear. She cleaned the cabin. Then she took a sponge bath. By the time she was finished with that task the trembling had eased up just a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she noticed the dark bruise on the side of her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe terror returned full force. How could she ever live without Nathan? What if she hadn\u0027t thought to take the pistols with her to the hold? What if she\u0027d stayed below with Nora and hadn\u0027t…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God,\" she whispered. \"It\u0027s all a mockery. I\u0027m such a coward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe leaned over the washstand and stared into the mirror. \"An ugly coward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan asked that question. He\u0027d entered the room without making any noise. Sara jumped a foot, then turned to look at him. She tried to hide the right side of her face by pulling her hair forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe realized she was crying. She didn\u0027t want Nathan to notice, though. She bowed her head and walked toward the bed. \"I believe I\u0027ll have a nap,\" she whispered. \"I\u0027m very weary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan blocked her path. \"Let me see your face,\" he ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hands rested on her hips. Sara\u0027s head was still bowed, and all he could see was the top of her head. He could feel her trembling. \"Does it hurt, Sara?\" he asked, his voice gruff with concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara shook her head. She still wouldn\u0027t look up at him. Nathan tried to nudge her chin up. She pushed his hand away. \"It doesn\u0027t hurt at all,\" she lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why are you crying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tenderness in his voice made her trembling increase. \"I\u0027m not crying,\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan was getting worried. He wrapped his arms around her waist and pulled her close. What the hell was going on inside her mind now? he wondered. Sara had always been so transparent to him. He never had to worry about what she was thinking. She always told him. Whenever she had a problem or a worry he knew about it immediately. And as soon as she\u0027d blurted out whatever was on her mind she demanded that he fix it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNathan smiled to himself. And damn if he didn\u0027t always fix it, too, he thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I would like to rest now, Nathan,\" she whispered, turning his thoughts back to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will tell me what\u0027s bothering you first,\" he ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe burst into loud tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you still not crying?\" he asked in exasperation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded against his chest. \"Jade never cries.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wouldn\u0027t repeat herself. She tried to move away from him then, but Nathan wouldn\u0027t let her. He was more forceful, more determined. He held her secure with one arm and pushed her chin up. His touch was gentle when he brushed the hair away from her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he saw the dark swelling on her cheek his expression turned murderous. \"I should have killed the bastard,\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a coward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe blurted out that confession, then nodded vehemently when he looked incredulous. \"It\u0027s true, Nathan. I didn\u0027t realize it until today, but now I know the truth about myself. I\u0027m not at all like Jade. The men are right. I don\u0027t measure up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was so surprised by her fervent speech that he didn\u0027t realize he\u0027d let go of her until she\u0027d turned and hurried over to the bed. She sat down on the side and stared at her lap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to have my nap now,\" she whispered again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was never going to understand her. Nathan shook his head and tried not to smile. It would injure his wife\u0027s feelings if she thought he was mocking her. Sara was pulling her hair over the right side of her face. It was obvious she was embarrassed about the bruise. \"I\u0027m not just a coward, Nathan. I\u0027m an ugly one. Jade has green eyes, doesn\u0027t she? The men say her hair is as red as fire. Jimbo said she\u0027s beautiful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why the hell are we talking about my sister?\" Nathan asked. He regretted his gruff tone of voice immediately. He wanted to ease Sara\u0027s distress, not increase it. In a much softer voice he said, \"You aren\u0027t a coward.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at him so that he could see her frown. \"Then why are my hands shaking, and why do I feel like I\u0027m going to be sick? I\u0027m so afraid right now, and all I can think about is what could have happened to you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What could have happened to me?\" He was stunned by her admission, humbled. \"Sara, you were also at risk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe acted as though she hadn\u0027t heard him. \"They could have killed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They didn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started crying again. He let out a sigh. This was going to take time, he decided. Sara needed more than just a quick denial. She needed him to touch her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he needed to touch her as well. Nathan stripped out of all his clothes but his pants. He\u0027d unbuttoned them and was about to pull them off, but then he decided he didn\u0027t want Sara to know what his intent was just yet. It would only turn her attention, and he wanted to address the problem first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara stood up when Nathan sat down. She watched him get comfortable. He leaned against the wood behind the pillows. One leg was stretched out, the other bent at the knee. He pulled her in front of him, then settled her between his legs. Her back rested against his chest, and with prodding her head fell back against his shoulder. Nathan\u0027s arm was around her waist. She wiggled her backside against him until she was comfortable. The movement made him grit his teeth. His wife still didn\u0027t have any idea how provocative she could be. She didn\u0027t realize how quickly she could make him want her. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-gift-crown-s-spies-3/page-25.html","bookId":1790,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:09:53 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:09:53 PM"}
