After the wolf incident at the high school, the town was still on alert. But so far there hadn\u0027t been any more wolves spotted at school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, there was a rumor spreading of another unusual sighting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbby and I were heading to the library to meet Ivy when we passed Heidi Rosen talking excitedly to her friend outside the auditorium. Abby loathed being the last person with the inside scoop. She stopped and we pretended we needed to check out the announcements on the bulletin board. Abby leaned in toward the gossiping girls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I swear!\" Heidi said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did it touch you?\" her friend asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. But I thought it might.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It?\" Abby said in a hushed tone. \"I wonder what it is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It had gray eyes,\" Heidi said. \"And fangs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think they are talking about a wolf,\" Abby whispered to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It stood on two legs,\" Heidi went on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe it\u0027s a circus wolf,\" I said to Abby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was a werewolf, I swear!\" Heidi said to her friend. \"But don\u0027t tell anyone. I know people will think I\u0027m crazy, but I had to tell you since you\u0027re my best friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was stunned. Someone had spotted Brandon. But I was confused since it wasn\u0027t a full moon. Abby and I found Ivy down by her locker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will never believe what I\u0027m going to tell you,\" Abby declared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Heidi Rosen said she saw a werewolf?\" Ivy asked nonchalantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you know?\" Abby asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jake just told me,\" Ivy replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who did he hear it from?\" Abby questioned her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is so bizarre,\" Abby said, lost in thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. She\u0027s really lost her mind,\" Ivy said. \"Or maybe it\u0027s that Wolfman, Brandon Maddox,\" she teased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t thrilled by my friend alluding to Brandon being a werewolf. But the reality was she was right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, maybe if Heidi stayed away from Nash, then she wouldn\u0027t be seeing things,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s been texting him,\" Ivy said, defending my ex, \"but he refuses to see her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She isn\u0027t spending any time with him,\" Abby said. \"We\u0027ve made sure of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, he\u0027s all about you,\" Ivy said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve told you,\" I assured them. \"It\u0027s okay. Nash and I are over.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvy tried her best to hide her frustration. \"If you need time to forgive him,\" she said, softening, \"that\u0027s okay. But please, don\u0027t take too long.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy lunchtime, rumor of Heidi\u0027s werewolf spotting had made its way around the entire school. But what was worse was the other gossip I overheard later that day. I was passing the biology lab when I heard a few tech guys talking by the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was coming back from computer club when this thing jumped out from behind a tree. I tried to get it on tape, but when I downloaded it, it was so fuzzy all you could see were trees. Here\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;look.\" He showed his friend his iPhone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s nothing here,\" he said. \"Seems you need to get glasses for your glasses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw something weird last night, too,\" the tech guy insisted as his friends entered the classroom. \"I swear on my iPod. I saw fangs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next few days, the werewolf-spotting stories escalated. Everyone swore they\u0027d had an encounter with some creature of the night, and I hadn\u0027t been able to even speak about it with Brandon. I knew he must be fraught with confusion. But the person closest to him and the situation was the one he was suddenly keeping away. He hadn\u0027t returned my calls lately, and I was worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash cornered me just as I opened the main door to exit the campus after a particularly nerve-racking day at school. \"Have you seen the werewolf yet?\" Nash asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not unless he\u0027s standing in front of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027t believe it, either. How could anyone really see a werewolf? Besides, it\u0027s not even a full moon,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know, that\u0027s what I thought,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNash raised an eyebrow at my serious tone but then shrugged it off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Although, who\u0027s to say...\" he continued. \"Maybe any moon can turn them. Wolves come out every night. Why wouldn\u0027t a werewolf? Why would he wait for only a full moon to claim his next victim?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shuddered at his suggestion. Wasn\u0027t it enough for Brandon to change under the full moon? Now we\u0027d have to deal with all moons?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to get home,\" I said. I was hoping to catch Brandon before he left so I could see how he was doing. And I missed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want you walking home, Celeste. Or anywhere, for that matter. I think it\u0027s best that you are always around someone. And I think that someone should be me.\" Nash didn\u0027t speak with his usual confidence but rather with a soft, genuine quality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, I insist,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll drive you.\" He even took my backpack from me and started walking toward his car.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you hated wolves,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;but I\u0027d hate for you to be involved with one even more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated in the doorway. \"Just as friends,\" I called after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just as friends,\" he confirmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was hard, knowing Nash as long as I had, to completely sever all ties with him. And I had been so busy with Brandon, I hadn\u0027t had the chance to miss Nash\u0027s friendship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon\u0027s Jeep was already gone. I\u0027d have to seek him out as soon as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to work on my research that evening. I checked my notes and my calendar. The moon was waning, still weeks away from being full again. I reviewed my observations on our romantic date with the wolves, the time I saw Brandon in the woods by the gymnasium, and watching him turn. I included these new werewolf sightings in my calendar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, my efforts to make contact with Brandon weren\u0027t going well. Brandon wasn\u0027t returning my calls or texts. I felt so awful for him, truly isolated from me, the other students, and now from the town. I wouldn\u0027t even be able to get to Dr. Meadows, who I knew was desperate to meet Brandon. Everything was getting so out of hand. I felt the world was caving in on us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It has to be wolves,\" my dad said at dinner about the werewolf sightings. I was like my father\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;skeptical about anything unfamiliar or not scientifically proven. But now I knew that a werewolf did exist and that he was being spotted by the local community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People don\u0027t have anything better to do than gossip,\" my mom said, referring to the town\u0027s rumors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"After those wolves showed up at your school,\" my dad said, \"I\u0027m sure it put thoughts in people\u0027s minds.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone is talking about it,\" my mom chimed in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make sure you don\u0027t walk home. Get a ride or I\u0027ll pick you up,\" my dad told me. \"Call me anytime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to admit a few girls at work said they saw one, too,\" my mom added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you on a curfew,\" my dad said to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just for the time being,\" he continued. \"You\u0027ve already had a run-in with a pack of wolves, and then they showed up at school. I don\u0027t want it to happen again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dad!\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to be the bad guy here, but I have to put my foot down.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA curfew wasn\u0027t really something I needed, as I was always back home well in advance of any grounding possibilities. But I didn\u0027t like that the once-peaceful town was suddenly overridden with fear. It seemed full moons, folklore, and strange events were affecting not only me and Brandon but the entire town of Legend\u0027s Run. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-in-a-full-moon-full-moon-1/page-25.html","bookId":2148,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:03 PM"}
