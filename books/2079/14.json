{"id":88715,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"\u003cp\u003eThe first person Rashel met in the mansion was Ivan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was sheer dumb luck, the same luck that had helped keep her alive so far tonight. She slipped in the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eback door, the way she and the girls had gone out. Standing in the huge silent kitchen, she listened for an\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einstant to the music that was still blasting from the inner house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she swiveled to check the cellar-and met Ivan the Terrible running up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had clearly just discovered that his twenty-four valuable slave girls were missing. His blond hair was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eflying, his eyes were wide with alarm, his mouth was twisted. He had the taser in one hand and a bunch\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof plastic handcuffs-the kind police use on rioters-in the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Rashel suddenly appeared on the stairway, his eyes flew open even wider. His mouth opened in astonishment-and then Rashel\u0027s foot impacted with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis forehead. The snap kick knocked him backward, and he tumbled down the stairs to hit the wooden door below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel leaped after him, making it to the bottom only a second after he did. But he was already out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are these? Were you supposed to take some girls up?\" She kicked at the plastic handcuffs. Ivan\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe Unconscious didn\u0027t answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at her watch. Only a quarter to nine. Maybe he\u0027d been taking the girls to get washed or\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esomething. It seemed too early to start the feast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunning noiselessly back up the stairs, she quietly closed the door. Now she had to follow the music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe needed to see where the vampires were, how they were situated, how she could best get at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wondered where Lily was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kitchen opened into a grand dining room with an enormous built-in sideboard. It had undoubtedly\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebeen made to accommodate whole suckling pigs or something, but Rashel had a dreadful vision of a girl\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elying on that coffinlike mahogany shelf, hands tied behind her, while vampire after vampire stopped by to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave a snack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed the idea out of her mind and moved silently across the floorboards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dining room led to a hall, and it was from the end of the hallway that music was coming. Rashel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eslipped into the dimly lit hall like a shadow,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emoving closer and closer to the doors there. The last door was the only one that showed light. That one,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore she could get near it, a figure blocked the light. Instantly Rashel darted through the nearest\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edoorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe held her breath, standing in the darkened room, watching the hall. If only one or two vampires came\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eout, she could pick them off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut nobody came out and she realized it must have just been someone passing in front of the light. At the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esame moment she realized that the music was very loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn\u0027t another room-it was the same room. She was in one gigantic double parlor, with a huge\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewooden screen breaking it up into two separate spaces. The screen was solid, but carved into a lacy\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epattern that let flickering light through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel thrust her knife in her waistband, then crept to the screen and applied her eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA spacious room, very masculine, paneled like the dining room in mahogany and floored in cherry\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eparquet. Glass brick windows-opaque. All Rashel\u0027s worry about somebody looking out had been for\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enothing. A fire burned in a massive fireplace, the light bringing out the ruddy tones in the wood. The\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhole room looked red and secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there they were. The vampires for the bloodfeast. Seven of the most powerful made vampires in the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eworld, Fayth had said. Rashel counted heads swiftly. Yes, seven. No Lily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You boys don\u0027t look that scary,\" she murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was one thing about made vampires. Unlike the lamia, who could stop aging-or start againwhenever\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey wanted, made vampires were stuck. And since the process of turning a human body into a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evampire body was incredibly difficult, only a young human could survive it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTry to turn somebody over twenty into a vampire and they would burn out. Fry. Die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe result was that all made vampires were stuck as teenagers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Rashel was looking at could have been the cast for some new TV soap about friends. Seven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eteenage guys, different sizes, different colors, but all Hollywood handsome, and all dressed to kill. They\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould have been talking and laughing about a fishing trip or a school dance... except for their eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was what gave them away, Rashel thought. The eyes showed a depth no high school guy could\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eever have. An experience, an intelligence... and a coldness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of these teenagers were undoubtedly hundreds of years old, maybe thousands. All of them were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabsolutely deadly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr else they wouldn\u0027t be here. They each expected to kill three innocent girls starting at midnight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese thoughts flashed through Rashel\u0027s mind in a matter of seconds. She had already decided on the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebest way to plunge into the room and start the attack. But one thing kept her from doing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were only seven vampires. And the eighth was the one she wanted. The client. The one who\u0027d\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehired Quinn and set up the feast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe it was one of these. Maybe that tall one with the dark skin and the look of authority. Or the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esilvery blond with the odd smile....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. Nobody really looks like a host. I think it\u0027s the one who\u0027s still missing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut maybe she couldn\u0027t afford to wait. They might hear the powerboats leaving over the steady pounding\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eof the music. Maybe she should just...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething grabbed her from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time she had no warning. And she wasn\u0027t surprised anymore. Her opinion of herself as a warrior\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad plummeted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe intended to fight, though. She went limp to loosen the grip, then reached between her own legs to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egrab her attacker\u0027s ankle. A jerk up would throw him off balance....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t do it. I don\u0027t want to have to stun you, but I will.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe recognized the mental voice, and the hand clamped across her mouth. And both the telepathy and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe skin contact were having an effect on her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t like before; no lightning bolts, no explosions. But she was overwhelmed with a sense of Quinn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe seemed to feel his mind-and the feeling was one of drowning in dark chaos. A storm that seemed\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejust as likely to kill Quinn as anyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted her cleanly and backed out of the room with her, into the hall, then up a flight of stairs. Rashel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edidn\u0027t fight. She tried to clear her head and wait for an opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time he\u0027d pulled her into an upstairs room and shut the door, she realized that there wasn\u0027t going\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto be an opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was just too strong, and he could stun her telepathically the instant she moved to get away. The\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etables had turned. There was nothing to do now but hope that she could face death as calmly as he had.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least, she thought, it would put a stop to her confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe let go of her and she slowly turned to look at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat she saw sent chills between her shoulder blades. His eyes were as dark and chaotic as the clouds\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe\u0027d sensed in his mind. It was scarier than the cold hunger she\u0027d seen in the eyes of the seven guys\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edownstairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA smile that shed rainbows. Rashel pressed her back against the wall and tried to brace herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me the knife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe simply looked at him. He pulled it out of her waistband and tossed it on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t like being knocked out,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t know why, but something about it really bothers me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quinn, just get it over with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And it took me a while to get myself untied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery time I meet you, I seem to end up hog-tied and unconscious. It\u0027s getting monotonous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Quinn... you\u0027re a vampire. I\u0027m a vampire hunter. Do what you have to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re also always threatening each other. Have you noticed that? Of course, everything we keep\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esaying is true. It is kill or be killed. And you\u0027ve killed a lot of my people, Rashel the Cat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027ve killed a lot of mine, John Quinn.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced away, looking into a middle distance. His pupils were enormous. \"Less than you might think,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eactually. I don\u0027t usually kill to feed. But, yes, I\u0027ve done enough. I said before, I know what you think of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eme.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel said nothing. She was frightened and confused and had been under strain for quite a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt that at any moment she could snap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We belong to two different races, races that hate each other. There\u0027s no way to get around that.\" He\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eturned his dark eyes back on her and gave her a brilliant smile. \"Unless, of course, we change it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going to make you a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething inside Rashel seemed to give way and fall. She felt as if her legs might collapse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe couldn\u0027t mean it, he couldn\u0027t be serious. But he was. She could tell. There was a kind of surface\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eserenity pasted over the dark roiling clouds in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo this was how he\u0027d solved an unsolvable problem. He had snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel whispered, \"You know you can\u0027t do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know I can do that. It\u0027s very simple, actually- all we have to do is exchange blood. And it\u0027s the only\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eway.\" He took hold of her arms just above the elbow. \"Don\u0027t you understand? As long as you\u0027re human,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNight World law says you have to die if I love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel stood stricken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn had stopped short, as if he were startled himself by what he\u0027d said. Then he gave an odd laugh\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand shook his head. \"If I love you,\" he repeated. \"And that\u0027s the problem, of course. I do love you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel leaned against the wall for support. She couldn\u0027t think anymore. She couldn\u0027t even breathe\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eproperly. And somewhere deep inside her there was a trembling that wouldn\u0027t stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve loved you from that first night, Rashel the Cat. I didn\u0027t want to admit it, but it was true.\" He was still\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egripping her tightly by the arms, leaning close to her, but his eyes were distant, lost in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d never met a human like you,\" he said softly, as if remembering. \"You were strong, you weren\u0027t weak\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand pathetic. You weren\u0027t looking for your own destruction. But you were going to let me go. Strength\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand compassion. And... honor. Of course I loved you.\" His dark eyes focused again. He looked at her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esharply. \"I\u0027d have been crazy not to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFalling into darkness... Rashel had a terrifying desire to simply collapse in his arms. Give in. He was so\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estrangely beautiful, and the power of his personality was overwhelming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd of course she loved him, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was suddenly excruciatingly clear. Undeniable. From the beginning he had struck a chord in her that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eno one else had ever touched. He was so much like her-a hunter, a fighter. But he had honor, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever he might try to deny it or get around it, deep inside him there was still honor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd like her, he knew the dark side of life, the pain, the violence. They had both seen-and done-things\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat normal people wouldn\u0027t understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was supposed to hate him... but from the beginning she\u0027d seen herself in him. She had felt the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebond, the connection between them....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel shook her head. \"No!\" She had to stop thinking these things. She would not surrender to the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edarkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t stop me, you know,\" Quinn said softly. \"That ought to make things easier for you. You don\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeven have to make a decision. It\u0027s all my fault. I\u0027m very, very bad, and I\u0027m going to make you a vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomehow that gave Rashel her voice back. \"How can you do that-to someone you love?\" she spat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I don\u0027t want you dead! Because as long as you\u0027re human, you\u0027re going to get yourself killed!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe put his face close to hers, their foreheads almost touching. \"I will not let you kill yourself,\" he said\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethrough his teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you make me a vampire, I will kill myself,\" Rashel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mind had cleared. However much she wanted to give in, however enticing the darkness might be, it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eall disappeared when she thought of how it would end. She would be a vampire. She\u0027d be driven by\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebloodlust to do things that would horrify her right now. And she\u0027d undoubtedly find excuses for doing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethem. She would become a monster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn was looking shaken. She\u0027d scared him, she could see it in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll feel differently once it\u0027s done,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Listen to me, Quinn.\" She kept her eyes on his, looking deep, trying to let him see the truth of what\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshe was saying. \"If you make me a vampire, the moment I wake up I\u0027ll stab myself with my own knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you think I\u0027m not brave enough?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re too brave; that\u0027s your problem.\" He was faltering. The surface serenity was breaking up. But\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat wasn\u0027t really helpful, Rashel realized, because underneath it was an agony of desperate confusion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn really couldn\u0027t see any other solution. Rashel couldn\u0027t see any herself-except that she didn\u0027t really\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eexpect to survive tonight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuinn\u0027s face hardened, and she could see him pushing away doubts. \"You\u0027ll get used to it,\" he said\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eharshly, his voice grating. \"You\u0027ll see. Let\u0027s start now,\" he added.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he bit her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was so fast. Unbelievably fast. He caught her jaw and tilted her head back and to the side-not\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eroughly but with an irresistible control and precision. Then before Rashel had time to scream, she felt a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehot sting. She felt teeth, vampire teeth, extended to an impossible delicacy and sharpness, pierce her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eflesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is it. This is death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePanic flooded her. But it wasn\u0027t death, of course-not yet. She wouldn\u0027t even be changed into a vampire\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eby a single exchange of blood. No, instead it would be slow torture... days of agony... pain....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe kept waiting for the pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead she felt a strange warmth and languor. Was he actually drinking her blood? All she could sense\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas Quinn\u0027s mouth nuzzling at her neck, his arms around her tightly. And...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt happened all at once. In a sudden silent explosion, white light engulfed her. It burst around her. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas floating in it. Quinn was floating in it. It was shining around them and through them, and she could\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efeel a connection with Quinn that made their last connection seem like a faulty telephone line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew him. She could see him, his soul, whatever you wanted to call it, whatever it was that made\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehim John Quinn. They seemed to be floating together in some other space, in a naked white light that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erevealed everything and mercilessly lit up all the most secret places.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd if anyone had asked her, Rashel would have said that would be horrible, and she would have run\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efor her life to get away from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn\u0027t horrible. She could see dreadful dark bits in Quinn\u0027s mind, and dreadful dark bits in hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTangled, thorny, scary parts, full of anger and hate. But there were so many other parts-some of them\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ealmost unused-that were beautiful and strong and whole. There was so much potential. Rainbow places\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethat were aching to grow. Other parts that seemed to quiver with light, desperate to be awakened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe ask so little of ourselves, Rashel thought in wonder. If everybody\u0027s like this-we stunt ourselves so\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebadly. We could be so much more....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t want you to be more. You \u0027re amazing enough the way you are.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Quinn. Not even his voice, just-Quinn. His thoughts. And Rashel knew her thoughts flowed to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehim without her even making an effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know what I mean. Isn\u0027t this strange? Does this always happen with vampires?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNothing like this has ever happened to me in my life, Quinn said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat he felt was even more, and Rashel could sense it directly, in a dizzying sweet wave. There was an\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eunderstanding between them that ran deeper than any words could convey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever was happening to them, however they had gotten to this place, one thing was obvious. Under\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe white light that revealed their inner selves, it was clear that small differences like being\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003evampire or human didn\u0027t matter. They were both just people. John Quinn and Rashel Jordan. People\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewho were stumbling through life trying to deal with the hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause there was hurt. There was pain in the landscape of Quinn\u0027s mind. Rashel sensed it without\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewords or even images; she could feel the feelings that had scarred Quinn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour father did something-he killed Dove? Oh, John. Oh, John, I\u0027m so sorry. I didn\u0027t know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRainbow lights shimmered when she called him John. It was the part of him that he had repressed the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emost ruthlessly. The part that she could almost feel growing in her presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo wonder you hated humans. After everything you\u0027d ken through, to have your own father want you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd no wonder you hated vampires. They killed someone dose to you-your mother? And you were so\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyoung. I\u0027m... sorry. He wasn\u0027t as easy with words as she was, but here they didn\u0027t need words. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecould sense his sorrow, his shame, and his fierce protectiveness. And she could sense the emotion behind\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis next question. Who did it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t know. I\u0027ll probably never know. Rashel didn\u0027t want to pursue it. She didn\u0027t want to feed the dark\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eside of Quinn; she wanted to see more of the shimmering light. She wanted to make the light grow until\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe dark disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel, that may not be possible. Quinn\u0027s thought wasn\u0027t bitter; it was serious and gentle. Tinged with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003einfinite regret. I may not be able to become anything better-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course you can. We all can. Rashel cut him off with absolute determination. She could feel the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebone-deep cold that had set into him years ago, that he\u0027d allowed to set in. I won\u0027t let you be cold, she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etold him, and she went for a romp in his mind, kissing things and blowing warmth into them, thinking\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esunlight and comfort everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease stop; I think you\u0027re killing me. Quinn\u0027s thought was shaky-half serious and half hysterical, like the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehelpless gasp of somebody being tickled to death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel\u0027s whole being was singing with elation. She was young-how strange that she had never really felt\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyoung until now-and she was in love and stronger than she had ever been before. She had John Quinn\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethe vampire squirming and semi-hysterical. She was unstoppable. Anything was possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027ll make everything be right, she told Quinn, and she was happy to see that she\u0027d driven his doubt and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis sadness away, at least for the moment. Do you really want me to stop?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. Quinn sounded dazed now-and bemused. I\u0027ve decided I\u0027ll enjoy dying this way. But...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRashel couldn\u0027t follow the rest of his thought, but she felt a new coldness, something like a wind from outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d forgotten there was an outside. In here, in the private cocoon of their minds, there was nothing but\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher and Quinn. It was almost as if nothing else existed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a whole world out there. Other people. Things happening. Things Rashel had to stop....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, God, Quinn-the vampires.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-the-chosen-night-world-5/page-14.html","bookId":2079,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:52 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:30:52 PM"}
