His face was covered with a lost expression. Due to some unknown reason, he could vaguely sense that the Dou Qi within his body had began to fluctuate in a strange fashion. That feeling was as though it had met something of the same origin…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is Heavenly Flame Dou Qi…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan mused for a moment before his eyes flashed. He came to a sudden comprehension. The Dou Qi within his body was tempered by the swallowing of many Heavenly Flames using the Flame Mantra. This kind of characteristic was similar to that of the Tou She Ancient God. After all, the latter was a Heavenly Flame. It was not unbelievable for these to be such a feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Xiao Yan, it seems that the inheritance of the Ancient God had chosen you…” Gu Yuan looked at the light pillar that covered Xiao Yan and his eyes involuntarily felt a sense of lost. Even he was unable to maintain his calmness in front of the inheritance of the Ancient God. After all, he had also been chasing after that level for thousands of years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Gu Yuan understood that he was unable to forcefully do anything about it. The inheritance of the Ancient God would choose its own inheritor. All of them had clearly been eliminated during the selection by the light earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMoreover, Xiao Yan could be considered his son-in-law. It was not difficult for Gu Yuan to accept the former becoming an elite Dou Di.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone revealed an expression of envy after hearing this. They began to cupped their hands together and congratulate Xiao Yan. Although their tone was quite envious, there was a greater amount of joy in them. Regardless of who the Ancient God inheritance selected, they would at the very least possess an opportunity to fight with Hun Tiandi!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ugh, the word luck really leaves one speechless…” Zhu Kun sighed. He immediately said, “Since the Ancient God inheritance had chosen you, you should just accept it. As long as you are able to advance to the Dou Di class before Hun Tiandi, this calamity will naturally be resolved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan hesitated for a moment before nodding quietly. He was well aware of the current situation. Once Hun Tiandi successfully complete the final step of the Di tier embryonic pill, the alliance would definitely suffer the most cruel form of vengeance. Given the character of the Hun clan, they would not feel any mercy even if they slaughtered an entire clan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Everyone please be rest assured that I, Xiao Yan, will definitely do my best!” Xiao Yan cupped his hands together towards everyone and spoke in a deep voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Ha ha, as for the Hun clan and Hun Tiandi, we will do our best to stop them. Hopefully, we will be able to hold out until you exit your retreat.” Yan Jin laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wish to keep this square into the Heavenly Tomb. I might be able to gain more time in that place.” Xiao Yan mused for a moment before sweeping his eyes around him and said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Heavenly Tomb huh… aye, this is a good idea. The flow of time is slower in that place compared to the outside world. In this way, you will be able to gain some extra time.” Gu Yuan nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s not waste any more time. I will act now!” Xiao Yan worked with lightning fast speed. After having decided on a plan, he waved his sleeve. A huge spatial crack appeared in the sky. After which, it spread apart and devoured the square and stone statue into it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Uncle Gu, if the alliance was to be defeated and is unable to fight… please shatter this jade piece. I will immediately exit my retreat.” Xiao Yan flicked his finger. A spiritual jade piece flew towards Gu Yuan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu Yuan nodded after receiving the spiritual jade piece. It was not impossible for such an event to occur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I will inform Xun Er and the rest about this matter…” Gu Yuan kept the piece of jade. His eyes stared at Xiao Yan as he softly said, “Everything… is up to you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe expressions of Lei Ying and the rest were stern. They cupped their hands together solemnly as they faced Xiao Yan. If Xiao Yan succeeded, the situation would be turned around. If he failed, everyone here would likely be unable to escape being annihilated!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan let out a deep breath as he looked at the many stern faces. He was indeed someone with a hard life. He had just rescued his father, only to end up with such a heavy mountain like burden on his shoulder. However, he must not fail this time around…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan quietly cupped his hands together towards everyone. He lifted his head and looked towards the incomparably large light cauldron in the distant sky. At the middle of the light cauldron was a spreading sea of blood. It appeared as though there was a human figure vaguely sitting at that spot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hun Tiandi, next, let’s see who will be the first to reach that stage!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Yan’s eyes were locked onto the sea of blood. He suddenly turned around and walked into the slowly shutting spatial crack. After which, his figure and the crack vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu Yuan and the rest looked at Xiao Yan’s disappeared figure. His hands were involuntarily clenched. This subsequent period of time would test their ability…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hopefully, we will be able to hold out until Xiao Yan exit his retreat…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGu Yuan muttered to himself. Immediately, he quickly landed onto the large hall. Everyone hurriedly followed. Subsequently, many orders were being issued in an orderly manner. The enormous alliance army was mobilized at this moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sea of blood scattered in the distant sky. That rich bloody scent filled the land. An extremely abundant energy filled the sea of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe middle of the sea of blood was a floating blood lotus. A figure with scattered hair sat on it. Vast and mighty endless energy continued to gather from the sea of blood and the surroundings. Finally, they surged into that figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat human figure appeared like a bottomless pit in the face of the endless amount of energy. It allowed the vast and mighty energy, which could even fill an elite Dou Sheng to the point of exploding, to pour wildly into it without showing the slightest trace of being full.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe human figure with both eyes tightly shut on the blood lotus, suddenly opened his eyes after having detected something. Those eyes appeared to be filled with blood, causing one to tremble despite not feeling cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This ripple…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHun Tiandi frowned slightly. He could detect a slight fear a moment earlier. However, that feeling had already vanished when he was about to carefully observe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Was I mistaken?” Hun Tiandi muttered to himself. The huge formation had enveloped the entire Central Plains. Even though he had already formed an initial merger within the Di tier embryonic pill, he still felt a great amount of pressure. If it was not because the formation was maintained by the strong foundation of the Hun clan, it was likely that it would already cracked apart. He was unable to split his attention and observe those slight changes over the Central Plains due to the need for him to remain focus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Chi!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHun Tiandi muttered softly to himself. A fluctuation suddenly appeared behind him and a black flame person appeared. It was the Nihility Devouring Flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How is the clan?” Hun Tiandi did not turn around as he asked in a faint voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Over a million descendant citizens had been thrown into the blood pool. However, it is still insufficient to maintain the formation.” The Nihility Devouring Flame looked at the back. A flash appeared in his eyes. Originally, both he and Hun Tiandi were of equal status. However, after Hun Tiandi had obtained the Di tier embryonic pill, this relationship had become uneven. Nevertheless, he did not have any solution to this. All he could do was to continue enduring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Throw all the descendant citizens we have captured from the Ling, Shi and Yao clans into the blood pool. If it is still insufficient, throw our clan’s descendant citizens into the blood pool. I require sufficient energy to complete the final step of completing this pill.” Hun Tiandi spoke indifferently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even our clan’s descendant citizens has to be thrown into the blood pool?” The Nihility Devouring Flame was startled as he said. “That will lead to the objection of many Elders.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You should understand how to deal with those who objects.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHun Tiandi laughed faintly. The blood lotus was rotated. Immediately, those blood covered eyes looked towards the Nihility Devouring Flame and softly said, “You should understand that I will pay any price in order to successfully step into that level. Remember, it is any price!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Hun clan will definitely be destroyed if I fail. At that time, even you will have difficulty escaping.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlack flames danced within the eyes of the Nihility Devouring Flame. Finally, he nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Relax, once I am able to advance into that level, I will also think of all ways for you to breakthrough.” Hun Tiandi laughed. “However, you must also perform your task before that well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Understood. I will do as you say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Nihility Devouring Flame nodded. After which, his body moved and he disappeared from the sea of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHun Tiandi smiled in a satisfied manner as he looked at the spot where the Nihility Devouring Flame had disappeared. A faint strange expression flashed across his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hun clan was able to survive until today because of the Nihility Devouring Flame. This was an extremely important matter to the entire Hun clan. In the hearts of many Elders, they had even thought of the Nihility Devouring Flame as the most important person within the Hun clan. After all, as long as he existed, the Hun clan would not decline because of bloodline issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a certain point of view, even Hun Tiandi might not be as important as the Nihility Devouring Flame in the hearts of certain members in the clan!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis situation was naturally detected by Hun Tiandi. However, he had never spoke anything with regards to this. This was because he understood that the old Hun clan did indeed need to rely on the Nihility Devouring Flame…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever… this kind of reliance would disappear from now onwards. At that time, the Nihility Devouring Flame would no longer be of any use…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I become a Dou Di, I would need to refine a good life flame…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHun Tiandi laughed softly. Those blood filled eyes appeared incomparably dark and cold. Immediately, the blood lotus was rotated. Both of his eyes were slowly shut as he continued to absorb the vast and mighty energy that was forcefully extracted from the Central Plains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn extremely faint black glow quietly flashed passed the sea of blood as Hun Tiandi turned around. A tiny black fire seedling was quietly extinguished from the sea of blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis scene had lasted for only a short moment. Additionally, it was hidden by the vast and mighty energy of the sea of blood. Even Hun Tiandi was unable to detect it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Nihility Devouring Flame, who had exited the Hun realm, looked at the hundreds of thousand feet large blood pool below him with a cold and indifferent expression. There was a continuous stream of people being thrown into it from around the blood pool. Miserable screech scattered across the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Nihility Devouring Flame watched this scene indifferently. The black flame over his finger suddenly flashed. Immediately, his body stiffened slightly. Both of his fists were slowly clenched. A densely cold expression flashed across his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1638\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1640\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/battle-through-the-heavens/btth-chapter-1639","bookId":1497,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:55 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 3:24:55 AM"}
