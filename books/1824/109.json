I\u0027ve been working eighty-hour weeks for Phillips because of that stupid contract, but as soon as the six months are up, things are going to change. I need a life outside of my computer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded, but neither one said another word until they were back in her apartment. His silence was making her extremely anxious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you think?\" she finally asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need a life, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTears came into her eyes. \"You do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Know what else I need?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I need you.\" He put his arms around her waist and pulled her close. \"I love you.\" He paused for a second and then said, \"I quit my job.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What . . . You what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been giving it a lot of thought the last couple of weeks. It took some hard-nosed soul-searching, but I finally figured out what I want. I told the bureau I was going to hand in my resignation Monday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlabbergasted, she stepped back so she could poke him in the chest. \"But you love your job. And you quit? What is wrong with you? Don\u0027t you know how to do anything in moderation? Does it always have to be all or nothing with you? Stop grinning at me. I\u0027m trying to make you think about your future.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am thinking about my future,\" he insisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe let him kiss her before she asked, \"When you told them you were quitting, what was the reaction?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got promoted.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Promoted?\" she repeated. \"You got promoted?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"Go figure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What does that mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hell if I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took her hand and led her into the bedroom. \"I won\u0027t be traveling much with my new position. I\u0027ve really grown to dislike it, anyway, and I\u0027ve trained enough agents who can get the job done.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAstonished by what he was telling her, she turned to him, speechless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweetheart, if you don\u0027t take your clothes off, I can\u0027t ravish you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was desperate to touch her, but he let her wash off the makeup first. When she returned to the bedroom, they set a new record for disrobing. He wanted to go slow, but the passion was too strong. All the feelings he had been holding inside for so long exploded in a glorious moment of ecstasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater, when she was lying next to him, Allison started laughing for no other reason than she was deliriously happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Next time we\u0027ll take it slow, I promise,\" he said, and then he laughed because he knew with Allison, that wasn\u0027t possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned up and took her hand in his. \"I\u0027ve been thinking. . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe waited, and when he didn\u0027t continue, she said, \"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked pensive. What was going on in his mind? \"You said you\u0027ve been thinking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. I\u0027ve been thinking you\u0027ll want me to come home to you every night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled. \"Yes, as a matter of fact, I do expect you to come home to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was searching for the right words, feeling awkward and unsure, which was completely foreign to him. But he wanted it to be right, and he had to get it said now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m thinking you\u0027ll want to sleep in my bed every night, so it should probably be our bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right again. Liam, what are you trying to say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged. \"I\u0027m thinking we should probably get married.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, we should.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned. \"Okay, since you asked, I\u0027ll marry you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not ask you-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure, you did. Just now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should warn you, it\u0027s not going to be normal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sex or our marriage?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our marriage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t expect it would be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not normal,\" she whispered. \"You need to know that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweetheart, I figured that out five minutes after I met you. You\u0027re far superior to normal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes filled with tears. \"That\u0027s the sweetest thing you could have said to me. What\u0027s the matter with you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you. That\u0027s what\u0027s the matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe cuddled up against him and closed her eyes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gently stroked her hair with his fingertips. \"I guess we should start looking for a town house somewhere in Silicon Valley.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About that . . .\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking we should live here in Boston.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah? With the new job, living here would be perfect for me,\" he admitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll still take on the boys,\" she said. \"As soon as I\u0027m finished with my newest weapon, they\u0027ll all want it. The FBI gets it first, though.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wired-buchanan-renard-13/page-109.html","bookId":1824,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:26:23 PM"}
