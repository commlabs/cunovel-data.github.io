And I stop and turn to the big gold double doors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause this is how it always happens in the movies, isn’t it? Some Kind of Wonderful, Pretty in Pink, and every other John hughes film I grew up watching. Just before the girl walks away or gets in the car, the guy comes sprinting down the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChasing after her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCalling her name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTelling her he didn’t mean it. Not any of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then they kiss. And the music plays and the credits roll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s what I want right now. The happy ending that everyone knew was coming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I hold my breath. And the doors open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou want to guess who’s in there? Go ahead—I’ll wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s empty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I feel my chest cave in on itself. My breaths come quick, panting through the pain—like when you twist an ankle. And my vision blurs as the elevator doors slowly close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seems so symbolic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI guess I’ve got my own doors to close now, huh?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wipe my eyes. And sniff. And I adjust the bag on my shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, Lou. I’m ready now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 8\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sshole. They say grief is a process. With stages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBastard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd breakups are a lot like a death. The demise of the person you were, of the life you’d planned to have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCocksucker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first stage is shock. Numbness. Like one of those trees in a forest—after a fire has ripped through it—that are scorched and hollow, but somehow still standing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike someone forgot to tell them you’re supposed to lay down when you’re dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDick toucher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCare to hazard a guess what the second stage is?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh yeah—it’s anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat have you done for me lately—I’m better off without you; I never liked you anyway—anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEar-fucker. No, that’s lame. Eater-of-ass.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe alphabetical naughty name-calling? It’s a game Delores and I made up in college. To vent our frustration against the outof-touch, stick-up-the-ass professors who were giving us a hard time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeel free to jump in anytime. It’s cathartic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd for some reason, a lot easier when you’re a high college student.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFuckface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway—what was I saying? That’s right—anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGooch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFury is good. Fire is fuel. Steam is power. And rage keeps you standing, when all you really want to do is curl up in a ball on the floor like a frightened armadillo.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHerniated Intestine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehere’s a fact for you: Married men live seven to ten years longer than bachelors. Married women, on the other hand, die about eight years earlier than their single counterparts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you shocked? Me neither.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInfected dick cheese.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause men are parasites. The life-sucking variety from the rainforest that burrow up your genitalia, then lay eggs in your kid-neys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Drew Evans is their leader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJerk-off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flight attendant asks me if I would like a complimentary beverage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m on the plane. Did I not mention that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t take the drink; I’m trying to avoid the airplane bathroom. Too many memories there. Fun, sweet memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKooch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSee—Drew doesn’t like to fly. he never came out and said it, never let it stop him, but I could tell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlying requires you to hand someone else the reins—to let go of the illusion of control. And we all know Drew has enough control issues to fill the Grand Canyon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight before takeoff, he’d get moody. Tense. And then, after the seat belt sign went off, he’d suggest a joint trip to the lavatory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo relieve some of that tension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could never say no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mile high Club? I’m a gold member now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaky discharge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the cart moves past me, I recline my seat back and close my eyes. And I think about what every scorned woman dreams of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePayback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuffering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePunishment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMolester of Llamas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot that I’m going to go all Lorena Bobbitt on him. A woman’s most powerful weapon is guilt—much more lethal than a machete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo my revenge scenarios revolve around . . . death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes it’s cancer; sometimes it’s childbirth. But in every one, Drew is banging on my deathbed door, begging to come in, to tell me how assholishly wrong he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehow sorry he is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he’s always too late. I’m already gone. And that knowledge destroys him—leaves him wrecked. Ruined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe guilt eats at him slowly, like a tooth in a glass of Coca-Cola.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNutsack puller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he spends the rest of his life alone wearing black, like an eighty-year-old Italian grandma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrca fingerer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s such a nice thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePillow-biting Pansy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s a double-word score.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelores would be so proud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQueef.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, yeah—I went there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRim job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou know, I think it’s better this way. No bullshit. If I look at the situation objectively, I’m better off this way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrew did me a favor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmegma eater.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause even though he likes to play dress-up in Daddy’s bigboy suits? Emotionally, he’s an adolescent. A child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTesticle licker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kind no one else likes to play with. Because when a game’s not going his way? he smashes the board to pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUrinary tract infection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd who needs that?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot me. No, sir. I deserve more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVagina.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m going to get through this. I’m Kate Fucking Brooks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will succeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will survive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will persevere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhoreboy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if it’s just to spite him. Stubborn is my middle name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eX-tra absorbent maxi-pad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was fine before Drew, and I’ll be fine after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust because I’ve never been alone, doesn’t mean I can’t be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI. Don’t. Need. him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeasty seepage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAre you convinced?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZithead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMe neither.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI know what you’re thinking. Why? That’s the big question, isn’t it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe one Nancy Kerrigan made famous. The one everyone wants answered when tragedy strikes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy, why, why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehuman beings like explanations. We crave reasons, something to blame. The levees were too low, the driver was drunk, her skirt was too short—the list is endless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe drive from Akron to Greenville takes about three hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s a lot of time to drive. And think. And I spent the whole trip thinking about why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf I had it to do all over again, I would have asked him. I wish I could say it was all some terrible mistake. A misunderstanding— like in Romeo and Juliet or West Side Story. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/twisted-tangled-2/page-18.html","bookId":1814,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:00:58 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:00:58 PM"}
