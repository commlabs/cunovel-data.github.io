{"id":98717,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\u003cp\u003eSt. Augustine asked the right question: \"Does freedom come from chance or choice?\" And you must remember that quantum mechanics guarantees chance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Raja Flattery, The Book of Ship\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUSUALLY, MORGAN Oakes took out his nightside angers and frustrations in long strides down any corridor of the ship where his feet led him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot this time! he told himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat in shadows and sipped a glass of astringent wine. Bitter, but it washed the taste of the ship\u0027s foul joke from his tongue. The wine had come at his demand, a demonstration of his power in these times of food shortages. The first bottle from the first batch. How would they take it groundside when he ordered the wine improved?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes raised the glass in an ancient gesture: Confusion to You, Ship!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wine was too raw. He put it aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes knew the figure he cut, sitting here trembling in his cubby while he stared at the silent com-console beside his favorite couch. He increased the light slightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce more the ship had convinced him that its program was running down. The ship was getting senile. He was the Chaplain/Psychiatrist and the ship tried to poison him! Others were fed from shiptits - not frequently and not much, but it happened. Even he had been favored once, before he became Ceepee, and he still remembered the taste - richly satisfying. It was a little like the stuff called \"burst\" which Lewis had developed groundside. An attempt to duplicate elixir. Costly stuff, burst. Wasteful. And not elixir - no, not elixir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stared at the curved screen of the console beside him. It returned a dwarfed reflection of himself: an overweight, heavy-shouldered man in a one-piece suit of shipcloth which appeared vaguely gray in this light. His features were strong: a thick chin, wide mouth, beaked nose and bushy eyebrows over dark eyes, a bit of silver at the temples. He touched his temples. The reduced reflection exaggerated his feeling that he had been made small by Ship\u0027s treatment of him. His reflection showed him his own fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will not be tricked by a damned machine!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe memory brought on another fit of trembling. Ship had refused him at the shiptits often enough that he understood this new message. He had stopped with Jesus Lewis at a bank of corridor shiptits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLewis had been amused. \"Don\u0027t waste time with these things. The ship won\u0027t feed us.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis had angered Oakes. \"It\u0027s my privilege to waste time! Don\u0027t you ever forget that!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had rolled up his sleeve and thrust his bare arm into the receptacle. The sensor scratched as it adjusted to his arm. He felt the stainless-steel nose sniff out a suitable vein. There was the tingling prick of the test probe, then the release of the sensor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the shiptits extruded plaz tubes to suck on, but this one was programmed to fill a container behind a locked panel - elixir, measured and mixed to his exact needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe panel opened!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes grinned at an astounded Lewis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Oakes remembered saying. \"The ship finally realizes who\u0027s the boss here.\" With that, he drained the container.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorrible!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis body was wracked with vomiting. His breath came in shallow gasps and sweat soaked his singlesuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was over as quickly as it began. Lewis stood beside him in dumb amazement, looking at the mess Oakes had made of the corridor and his boots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You see,\" Oakes gasped. \"You see how the ship tried to kill me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relax, Morgan,\" Lewis said. \"It\u0027s probably just a malfunction. I\u0027ll call a med-tech for you and a repair robox for thi.... this thing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a doctor, dammit! I don\u0027t need a med-tech poking around me.\" Oakes held the fabric of his suit away from his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then let\u0027s get you back to your cubby. We should check you out an....\" Lewis broke off, looking suddenly over Oakes\u0027 shoulder. \"Morgan, did you summon a repair unit?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes turned to see what had caught Lewis\u0027 attention, saw one of the ship\u0027s robox units, a one-meter oval of bronze turtle with wicked-looking tools clutched in its extensors. It was weaving drunkenly down the corridor toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you suppose is wrong with that thing?\" Lewis muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s here to attack us,\" Oakes said. He grabbed Lewis\u0027 arm. \"Let\u0027s back out of her.... slow, now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey retreated from the shiptit station, watching the scanner eye of the robox and the waving appendages full of tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not stopping.\" Oakes\u0027 voice was low but cold with fear as the robox passed the shiptit station.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d better run for it,\" Lewis said. He spun Oakes ahead of him into a main passageway to Medical. Neither man looked back until they were safely battened inside Oakes\u0027 cubby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHah! Oakes thought, remembering. That had frightened even Lewis. He had gone back groundside fast enough - to speed up construction of their Redoubt, the place which would insulate them groundside and make them independent of this damned machine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship\u0027s controlled our lives too long!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes still tasted bitterness at the back of his throat. Now, Lewis was incommunicad.... sending notes by courier. Always something frustrating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn Lewis!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes glanced around his shadowed quarters. It was nightside on the orbiting ship and most of the crew drifted on the sea of sleep. An occasional click and buzz of servos modulating the environment were the only intrusions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow long before Ship\u0027s servos go mad?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ship, he reminded himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShip was a concept, a fabricated theology, a fairy tale imbedded in a manufactured history which only a fool could believe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is a lie by which we control and are controlled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried to relax into the thick cushions and once more took up the note which one of Lewis\u0027 minions had thrust upon him. The message was simple, direct and threatening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ship informs us that it is sending groundside one (1) Chaplain/Psychiatrist competent in communications. Reason: the unidentified Ceepee will mount a project to communicate with the electrokelp. I can find no additional information about this Ceepee but he has to be someone new from hyb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes crumpled the note in his fist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne Ceepee was all this society could tolerate. The ship was sending another message to him. \"You can be replaced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had never doubted that there were other Chaplain/Psychiatrists somewhere in the ship\u0027s hyb reserves. No telling where those reserves might be hidden. The damned ship was a convoluted mess with secret sections and random extrusions and concealed passages which led nowhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColony had measured the ship\u0027s size by the occlusion shadow when it had eclipsed one of the two suns on a low passage. The ship was almost fifty-eight kilometers long, room to hide almost anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut now we have a planet under us: Pandora.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGroundside!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked at the crumpled note in his hand. Why a note? He and Lewis were supposed to have an infallible means of secret communication - the only two Shipmen so gifted. It was why they trusted each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo I really trust Lewis?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the fifth time since receiving the note, Oakes triggered the alpha-blink which activated the tiny pellet imbedded in the flesh of his neck. No doubt the thing was working. He sensed the carrier wave which linked the capsule computer to his aural nerves, and there was that eerie feeling of a blank screen in his imagination, the knowledge that he was poised to experience a waking dream. Somewhere groundside the tight-band transmission should be alerting Lewis to this communication. But Lewis was not responding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEquipment failure ?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes knew that was not the problem. He personally had implanted the counterpart of this pellet in Lewis\u0027 neck, had made the nerve hookups himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I supervised Lewis while he made my implant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas the damned ship interfering?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes peered around at the elaborate changes he had introduced into his chubby. The ship was everywhere, of course. All of them shipside were in the ship. This cubby, though, had always been differen.... even before he had made his personal alterations. This was the cubby of a Chaplain/Psychiatrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the crew lived simply. They slept suspended in hammocks which translated the gentle swayings of the ship into sleep. Many incorporated padded pallets or cushions for those occasions that arose between men and women. That was for love, for relaxation, for relief from the long corridors of plasteel which sometimes wound tightly around the psyche and squeezed out your breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreeding, thoug.... that came under strictest Ship controls. Every Natural Natal had to be born shipside and under the supervision of a trained obstetrics crew - the damned Natali with their air of superior abilities. Did the ship talk to them? Feed them? They never said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes thought about the shipside breeding rooms. Although plush by usual cubby standards, they never seemed as stimulating as his own cubby. Even the perimeter treedomes were preferred by some - under dark bushe.... on open grass. Oakes smiled. His cubby, though - this was opulent. Women had been known to gasp when first entering the vastness of it. From the core of the Ceepee\u0027s cubby, this one had been expanded into the space of five cubbies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the damned ship never once interfered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis place was a symbol of power. It was an aphrodisiac which seldom failed. It also exposed the lie of Ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose of us who see the lie, control. Those who don\u0027t see i.... don\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt a little giddy. Effect of the Pandoran wine, he thought. It snaked through his veins and wormed into his consciousness. But even the wine could not make him sleep. At first, its peculiar sweetness and the thick warmth had promised to dull the edge of doubts that kept him pacing the nightside passages. He had lived on three or four hours\u0027 sleep each period fo.... how long now? Anno.... anno....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes shook his head to clear it and felt the ripple of his jowls against his neck. Fat. He had never been supple, never selected for breeding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmond Kingston chose me to succeed him, though. First Ceepee in history not selected by the damned ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas he going to be replaced by this new Ceepee the ship had chosen to send groundside?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOakes sighed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLately, he knew he had turned sallow and heavy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToo much demand on my head and not enough on my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever a lack of couch partners, though. He patted the cushions at his side, remembering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m fifty, fat and fermented, he thought. Where do I go from here? \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-jesus-incident-destination-void-2/page-2.html","bookId":2170,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:37:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:37:03 PM"}
