In his life, he had accomplished many extraordinary things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he first started to roam Jianghu, people were already calling him “the Fox.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, other than his fox-like craftiness, he was also as patient as a camel, as hardworking as a farm ox, as vicious as a bird of prey, as nimble as a pigeon, and as sharp as a sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSadly, he had already grown old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis vision had grown dim, his muscles slack, his reflexes slow. He also had contracted a serious case of rheumatism, and had spent years bed-ridden, to the point where he could no longer even stand up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, his intelligence had not grown dim, and was in fact sharper than ever. His method of handling affairs was also more prudent and careful than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo down to this day, he still commanded much respect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was an ancient hall, spacious and tall, yet filled with an unspeakable gloominess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tables and chairs were also archaic, the color of the paint fading away. When wind blew into the hall, it carried along dust, which settled onto everything, including guests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wind blew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie helped Dragon Fifth brush the dust off of his body, then muttered, “They really should clean this place up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDragon Fifth looked at him. “You have dust all over yourself, too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie laughed. “I don’t care. Some people are destined to roll around in mud and dust.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you’re one of those people?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie nodded. “But you aren’t. Patriarch Hu isn’t either.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Do you really need to compare me to him?” asked Dragon Fifth coolly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You two are basically the same type of person,” said Liu Changjie. “Inherently superior.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDragon Fifth said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe large hall was once again silent. The wind blew the paper windows, which sounded like the falling of leaves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAutumn was dying, and soon it would snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is the master here?” called out Liu Changjie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.” The doorman was old. “Wait in the hall, I’ll notify him you’re here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man had a full head of white hair, and his face was covered with scars. It was safe to assume this man was Power of Hu’s partner, and that they been through hell and high water together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs such, he wasn’t very polite. But, Liu Changjie was willing to forgive him, and waited in the main hall. He waited for a very long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Hu Yue’er?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe should know that Liu Changjie was here. Why didn’t she appear?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie didn’t ask. Actually, there was no one to ask even if he wanted to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been to this place twice, and had only ever seen three people here. Power of Hu, Hu Yue’er, and the old doorman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, if you think you could come and go as you please in this place, you would be wrong, and you would pay dearly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd the meaning of “pay dearly” is, you would pay with your life!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatriarch Hu’s career had spanned decades, and it was hard to say how many criminals he had apprehended.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was even harder to say how many people sought revenge against him. Many of those people had come to this place to try.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd of the people who had come, not one had ever left alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moonlight was beginning to fade, and the hall grew gloomier and gloomier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePatriarch Hu still hadn’t appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDragon Fifth could not help but laugh coldly. “It seems he really is arrogant.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re not the only arrogant person in the world,” replied Liu Changjie coolly. “In any case, if I were you, I wouldn’t be anxious to see him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Isn’t he anxious to see me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He doesn’t need to be anxious.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I’m like a fish in a net?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In his eyes, you’re a poisonous dragon.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He is a very cautious person. Without checking everything thoroughly, he would never come to see you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Check what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Check to see if the poisoned dragon really has become a fish, and then check to see if the fish is useful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Check with who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who understands you the best? Who knows the most about this whole matter?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lan Tianmeng?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie smiled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He’s here too?” said Dragon Fifth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think he just arrived.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDragon Fifth was again silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd at that moment could be heard the hoarse, smiling voice of an old man. “My apologies for keeping you waiting so long.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart 2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the long, wide hall were several arched doors covered with screens, separating the hall into five areas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie and Dragon Fifth were in the first area, and the voice emanated from the last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey could see a pale, emaciated old man, wrapped in a fox-fur robe, sitting in a large wheelchair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind the chair, pushing it forward, was the old doorman, and Lan Tianmeng.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, a clanging sound rang out, and four sets of iron bars fell down, covering the arching doorways, completely cutting off Liu Changjie from Patriarch Hu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bars were as thick as a child’s arm. Even a thousand men and horses together would have a hard time getting past them\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie didn’t care. The first time he was here, he had seen the same thing. The one who cared was Dragon Fifth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t until this moment that he truly understood how cautious and careful Power of Hu was. There really was no one who could compare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie had already stood up, and bowed, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Master, are you well?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower of Hu’s eyes narrowed into lines as he laughed. “I’m very well. You are well. We’re all well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie smiled. “There’s only one person who isn’t well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower of Hu said, “Heaven’s net is wide meshed, nothing escapes it. The way of Heaven is fair, but the guilty will not escape. [1] I always knew that eventually he would end up like this.” Smiling, he continued, “And I didn’t misjudge you, either. I knew you wouldn’t disappoint me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie glanced at Lan Tianmeng and laughed. “Everything that happened, you already told the master?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Tianmeng rubbed the scabs on his face and laughed bitterly. “If you had hit any harder, I’m afraid I wouldn’t have been able to tell him anything.” [2]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower of Hu laughed loudly. “As of now, you two can finally call it even. Don’t put these things to heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly waved a hand and turned his head. “Remove these things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“These things” were the four sets of iron bars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the scar-faced old doorman hesitated, Power of Hu’s eyebrows furrowed. “Don’t forget, Master Liu is our brother. There should be no obstacles between brothers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What a good set of brothers,” said Dragon Fifth with a dark smile. “One is a lacky, the other is a fox.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower of Hu’s facial expression didn’t change. With a smile, he said, “Don’t forget, only brothers like us continue to live. People like you will be sent to death without a proper burial, one by one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e**\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe iron bars were gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower of Hu said, “Give the package to Master Liu. And bring the poisonous dragon to me. I want to have a look.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe old man immediately brought forth a package wrapped in brocade cloth. Inside the package was a set of green clothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the same set of clothing Liu Changjie and Hu Yue’er had worn the night they professed their love for each other. It still smelled like her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower of Hu said, “Before she left, she especially requested to leave these for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie’s heart skipped a beat. “She … where did she go?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sad expression fell onto Power of Hu’s sallow, hoary face. “A place where everyone goes to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A place that you can never return from?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The moon has phases of darkness and light,” said Power of Hu. “And people have partings and reunions. [3] You’re still young, you should be able to accept this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie grew stiff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould Hu Yue’er really be dead?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was constantly giving him instructions, telling him to be safe and stay alive, how could she be the one to die?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could she have died so suddenly, so early?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie didn’t dare believe it, didn’t want to believe it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, he couldn’t deny it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower of Hu sighed again, looked more aged and haggard than before. “From the time she was small she had a foul disease, difficult to treat. She knew that she could pass at any time. She hid the truth from you all this time, and the reason she would never marry you was because she didn’t want to break your heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie didn’t move, didn’t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all, he was not a passionate and impulsive youth, ready to burst out with emotion. He stood there stupidly, as if he had turned into stone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Tianmeng also sighed. “I always tell people not to drink, but right now …” A wine jug appeared in his hands, and he walked forward. “You really should have a drink or two...”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wine was already warmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt seemed he had prepared it especially for Liu Changjie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor someone whose heart has already been broken, what other comfort in the world is there than drinking?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut why drink?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen wine penetrates the restless heart, will it not turn into tears of lovesickness?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet, why not drink?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe happiness that comes with being drunk is always a good thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie suddenly grabbed the wine jug. Laughing reluctantly, he said, “Have a drink with me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don’t drink,” said Lan Tianmeng. He gave a forced laugh. “The blood in my mouth still isn’t dry, I shouldn’t drink even a drop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even if you don’t want to drink, you still have to drink.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Tianmeng stared, shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even if you don’t want to drink, you still have to drink.” What did this mean? Who would have thought that Liu Changjie had even more shocking plans in mind?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe suddenly tilted up the wine jug, aiming to pour the wine into Lan Tianmeng’s mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLan Tianmeng’s face twisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe scar-faced old man’s face also twisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly Power of Hu remained expressionless. He waved his hand, and three dots of light shot forth like cold stars, toward Dragon Fifth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDragon Fifth’s acupuncture points had been sealed, and he had just been dragged over by the old man like a dead fish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, as soon as the three dots shot forth, his body flew into the air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked like a divine dragon soaring in the heavens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower of Hu, normally as cold as deadwood and as solid as a rock, looked shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a tinkling sound, and sparks showered across the room as his hidden weapons weapons embedded themselves into limestone floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, there was another tinkling sound. Lan Tianmeng’s fist shot out, not to strike Liu Changjie’s face, but to shatter the jug of wine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wine in the pot splashed out, flying like sparks, splattering all over his face and into his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was as if he had been struck by the most dreadful hidden weapon in the world. He cried out hoarsely and, rubbing his eyes with his hands, charged wildly away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould it be that the wine in the jug was poisoned?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie had already completed the task assigned by Power of Hu. Why would he order someone to poison him to death?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd how could the prisoner captured by Liu Changjie, the completely immobilized Dragon Fifth, suddenly fly into the air like a divine dragon?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart 3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no wind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside the window, leaden clouds filled the skies like a huge ink painting. [4]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sad and shrill shrieking had ceased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Lan Tianmeng charged forth, he had reached the stone steps leading outside. And then he fell, and his powerful, stalwart body shriveling and drying up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Liu Changjie saw him fall, he turned his head. Dragon Fifth had floated back to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower of Hu sat there, unmoving. His expression had returned to normal, and he was muttering under his breath.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Seven steps. He only made it seven steps.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie let out a soft sigh. “The poison was very powerful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I mixed it myself,” said Power of Hu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“For me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower of Hu nodded. “You’re going to be sorry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sorry?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The flavor of the wine was very good.” His eyes seemed to carry a look of sorrow. “It was too good for Lan Tianmeng.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He was not a good person, his death was also too good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Death is death…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There are many types of death,” interrupted Power of Hu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And his death, what type was it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“His death was happy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because it was quick?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower of Hu nodded “The faster you die, the less pain there is. Only good people deserve this kind of death.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe lifted his head and stared at Liu Changjie. A strange smile appeared on his face, and after a while he said, “I always thought you were a good person, so I mixed the poisoned wine especially for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie laughed. “Hearing this, it seems I should havefer thanks.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You definitely should thank me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But, you forgot about something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, what?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You forgot to ask me whether or not I wanted to die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When I want to kill people,” said Power of Hu coolly, “I never ask whether or not they want to die. I only ask whether or not they deserve to die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie sighed. “It makes sense.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And so, you should be dead now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I’m not. Is it because I’m not a good person?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower of Hu laughed. “You definitely aren’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I was a good person, I would never have realized that you wanted to kill me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How did you figure it out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I knew from the very beginning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“From the very beginning I suspected that the true criminal was not Dragon Fifth, but you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mainly because all these cases cropped up after you retired. Dragon Fifth isn’t scared of you at all. If he was really the perpetrator, he wouldn’t need to wait for your retirement.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This line of reasoning isn’t enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Among these cases, every single one was carried off perfectly. Not one clue was left behind. Only a true expert on crime could be so efficient.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dragon Fifth isn’t a true expert?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He isn’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“How can you tell?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I am an expert. I can tell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You were sure about this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, so I had to get some evidence.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And so you went after Dragon Fifth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie nodded. “That also made you trust me, and let your guard down. Otherwise I wouldn’t be able to get close to you.” He laughed. “If I didn’t bring Dragon Fifth here with me, would you have called for the bars to be removed?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower of Hu sighed. “I really did misjudge you. You really aren’t a good person.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I didn’t misjudge you at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower of Hu laughed again, but the laughter didn’t reach his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What kind of person am I, then?” he said with a smile. “Can you really tell?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No one can match your caution and intelligence,” said Liu Changjie. “But sadly, you are too ambitious for your own good.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower of Hu sat listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When you started your crime spree, maybe you intended to stop. But after you started, you couldn’t. You just couldn’t be content with what you had.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower of Hu looked at him, his pupils two tiny dots of ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And so your crimes grew greater and greater, more and more. You knew that it was dangerous, but you also knew that even though you were retired, they would eventually come to you for help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed to be somewhat caught up with emotion. “Once a person receives a free meal from the government, they will never be able to get the taste out of their mouth.” [5]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And so,” said Power of Hu, “I definitely needed to find some to be a scapegoat, and take the blame for all the cases.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because if you cleared all the cases, then you would be able to get away scot free.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower of Hu smiled. “It seems you really are an expert.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But there was still something I couldn’t figure out. Why did you pick Dragon Fifth?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You couldn’t figure it out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anyone else you picked as a scapegoat would have been easier to handle than Dragon Fifth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower of Hu glanced at Dragon Fifth. He had sat down in the most comfortable seat he could find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe seemed very calm and relaxed, as if this matter had nothing to do with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower of Hu sighed. “I shouldn’t have picked him. He really is too difficult to deal with.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you had no choice.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh? Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because you weren’t the only person to make the decision.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have a partner, a person who had long ago decided that Dragon Fifth needed to die.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When did you figure that out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“When I arrived at Madam Lovesickness’s place.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t tell me my partner is Qiu Hengbo?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie nodded. “She shouldn’t have known that I would go after for her. And yet she was prepared all along, waiting for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And you suspect that I told her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The only people who knew about it, other than me, were Dragon Fifth, Qiu Huhua and Hu Yue’er.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And, of course, you wouldn’t tell her.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Neither would Dragon Fifth or Qin Huhua.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower of Hu couldn’t deny this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So I thought about it a lot, and decided that there was only one way for Qiu Hengbo to find out—if you two had been collaborating all along.” He laughed again. “Furthermore, I might not be a good judge of people, but six plus one is seven. Even I could calculate this debt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower of Hu frowned. He didn’t understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I already knew that Qiu Hengbo’s secret cave was guarded by seven people. But Hu Yue’er only told me the names of six people. That day at the inn in the Qixia Mountains, I only saw six people.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You saw Tang Qing, Shan Yifei, Soul Enticing Lao Zhao, Iron Monk, Li the Mastiff, and the hermaphrodite?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie nodded. “So I thought it was very strange. Where was the other person?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And now you figured it out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“After thinking about it, there’s only one explanation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Which is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She never talked about the seventh person, because I know that person.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And who is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If it isn’t Wang Nan, then it must be Hu Yue’er.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWang Nan was the man at the farmhouse, pretending to be Hu Yue’er’s greedy husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I obviously knew that Wang Nan isn’t a real country bumpkin, and he’s also not a real constable.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You knew all about him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s because I didn’t know that I was suspicious.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower of Hu sighed. “You thought things through very thoroughly. Even more thoroughly than me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“There’s also some things you haven’t figured out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Many things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Such as?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You didn’t really capture Dragon Fifth?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You yourself said he is not an easy person to deal with.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He didn’t really kill Qin Huhua?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Qin Huhua is his very good friend, in fact, his only true friend. He wouldn’t kill this type of friend.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So everything was just an act, played out for Lan Tianmeng?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I realized early on that you definitely would have an undercover agent next to Dragon Fifth.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So you intentionally allowed Lan Tianmeng to return first and tell me everything he saw.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I beat him up a bit, not to vent my anger, but to get you to trust me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower of Hu laughed bitterly. “I really never imagined that you and Dragon Fifth would work together to put on such a show.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now can you imagine it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“After you saw Qiu Hengbo, you never met with him, did you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then, how did you plan everything out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLiu Changjie laughed suddenly. “Do you know why I purposely pissed off Kong Lanjun?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower of Hu shook his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I wanted her to take the empty box back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What secret was in the box?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing special, just a script.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The script to your little act.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I knew Kong Lanjun would take the box back to Dragon Fifth, and that he would look at the script and be willing to play along.” He continued, laughing, “You clearly didn’t misjudge him, and neither did I. However, it seems he is much more intelligent than either of us imagined. His acting was much better than mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You forgot one of the roles,” said Dragon Fifth, suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Qin Huhua,” said Liu Changjie with a smile. “He acted very well too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But he was worried,” replied Dragon Fifth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Worried that my plan wouldn’t work?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDragon Fifth nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you went through with it,” said Liu Changjie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s because he was the only one who was worried.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You weren’t worried?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDragon Fifth laughed. “I don’t have very many friends, and there aren’t very many people who I’ve misjudged.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What kind of person do you think Power of Hu is?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“His greatest weakness isn’t a greedy heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An evil heart.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your perception is more accurate than mine.” He sighed, and turned toward Power of Hu. “If you hadn’t been so eager to kill us, we might still not be sure of your guilt!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re sure now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Without a doubt.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But it seems you’ve forgotten something,” said Power of Hu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The thief used flying skills to enter the Prince’s private compound.

The laughter in his eyes was like that of a crafty fox, or a poisonous scorpion.
