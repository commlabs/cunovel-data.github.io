He said, with an eyebrow lifted, \"One gets a feeling for these things. When one has seen as much of the microcosm as I have, one can sense danger-or lack of danger.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was an outright lie, and Rodriguez proved it by carefully transferring samples of the various germ colonies into buffered, isotonic media and injecting hamsters with the concentrated result.
