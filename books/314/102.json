{"id":21076,"no":102,"title":"Chapter 102","content":"\u003cp\u003eWith Hiro Protagonist seemingly gone from the stage, the hackers turn their attention toward the giant construction rising up out of the egg. All that nonsense with the sword fight must have been just a wacky introductory piece -- Hiro\u0027s typically offbeat way of getting their attention. This light and sound show is the main attraction. The amphitheater is now filling up rapidly as thousands of hackers pour in from all over the place: running down the Street from The Black Sun, streaming out, of the big office towers where the major software corporations are headquartered, goggling into the Metaverse from all points in Reality as word of the extravaganza spreads down the fiber-optic grapevine at the speed of light.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe light show is designed as if late corners were anticipated. It builds to false climax after false climax, like an expensive fireworks show, and each one is better. It is so vast and complicated that no one sees more than 10 percent of it; you could spend a year watching it over and over again and keep seeing new things.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt is a mile-high structure of moving two- and three-dimensional images, interlocked in space and time. It\u0027s got everything in it. Leni Riefenstahl films. The sculptures of Michelangelo and the fictional inventions of Da Vinci made real. World War II dogfights zooming in and out of the middle, veering out over the crowd, shooting and burning and exploding. Scenes from a thousand classic films, flowing and merging together into a single vast complicated story.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut in time, it begins to simplify itself and narrow into a single bright column of light. By this point, it is the music that is carrying the show: a pounding bass beat and a deep, threatening ostinato that tells everyone to keep watching, the best is yet to come. And everyone does watch. Religiously.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe column of light begins to flow up and down and resolve itself into a human form. Actually, it is four human forms, female nudes standing shoulder to shoulder, facing outward, like caryatids. Each of them is carrying something long and slender in her hands: a pair of tubes.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eA third of a million hackers stare at the women, towering above the stage, as they raise their arms above their heads and unroll the four scrolls, turning each one of them into a flat television screen the size of a football field. From the seats in the amphitheater, the screens virtually blot out the sky; they are all that anyone can see.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe screens are blank at first, but finally the same image snaps into existence on all four of them at once. it is an image consisting of words; it says\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIF THIS WERE A VIRUS YOU WOULD BE DEAD NOW FORTUNATELY IT\u0027S NOT THE METAVERSE IS A DANGEROUS PLACE; HOW\u0027S YOUR SECURITY?
