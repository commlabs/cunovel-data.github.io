End.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same groups of young men staggered through the streets, drunk on beer, though most of them were in uniform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same painted girls in tight dresses strolled along the pavements, eyeing potential customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe illuminated signs outside clubs and bars were switched off, because of the blackout, but all the establishments were open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark and Flick arrived at the Criss-Cross Club at ten o\u0027clock in the evening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe manager, a young man wearing a dinner jacket with a red bow tie, greeted Mark like a friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick\u0027s spirits were high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark knew a female telephone engineer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick was about to meet her, and she felt optimistic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark had not said much about her, except that her name was Greta, like the film star.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Flick tried to question him, he just said, \"You have to see her for yourself.\" As Mark paid the entrance fee and exchanged commonplaces with the manager, Flick saw an alteration come over him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grew more extrovert, his voice took on a lilt, and his gestures became theatrical.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick wondered if her brother had another persona that he put on after dark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey went down a flight of stairs to a basement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place was dimly lit and smoky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick could see a five- piece band on a low stage, a small dance floor, a scatter of tables, and a number of booths around the dark perimeter of the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had wondered if it would be a men-only club, the kind of place that catered to chaps like Mark who were \"not the marrying kind.\" Although the patrons were mostly male, there was a good sprinkling of girls, some of them very glamorously dressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA waiter said, \"Hello, Markie,\" and put a hand on Mark\u0027s shoulder, but gave Flick a hostile glare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Robbie, meet my sister,\" Mark said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her name\u0027s Felicity, but we\u0027ve always called her Flick.\" The waiter\u0027s attitude changed, and he gave Flick a friendly smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very nice to meet you.\" He showed them to a table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick guessed that Robbie had suspected she might be a girlfriend, and had resented her for persuading Mark to change sides, as it were.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he had warmed to her when he learned she was Mark\u0027s sister.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark smiled up at Robbie and said, \"How\u0027s Kit?\" \"Oh, all right, I suppose,\" Robbie said with the hint of a flounce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve had a row, haven\u0027t you?\" Mark was being charming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was almost flirting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a side of him Flick had never seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, she thought, it might be the real Mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other persona, his discreet daytime self, was probably the pretense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When have we not had a row?\" Robbie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He doesn\u0027t appreciate you,\" Mark said with exaggerated melancholy, touching Robbie\u0027s hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re right, bless you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething to drink?\" Flick ordered scotch and Mark asked for a martini.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick did not know much about men such as these.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had been introduced to Mark\u0027s friend, Steve, and had visited the flat they shared, but had never met any of their friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough she was madly curious about their world, it seemed prurient to ask questions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t even know what they called themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the words she knew were more or less unpleasant: queer, homo, fairy, nancy-boy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mark,\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you call men who, you know, prefer men?\" He grinned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Musical, darling,\" he said, waving his hand in a feminine gesture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI must remember that, Flick thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow I can say to Mark, \"Is he musical?\" She had learned the first word of their secret code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA tall blonde in a red cocktail dress came swishing onto the stage to a burst of applause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is Greta,\" said Mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a telephone engineer by day.\" Greta began to sing \"Nobody Knows You When You\u0027re Down and Out.\" She had a powerful, bluesy voice, but Flick noticed immediately that she had a German accent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShouting into Mark\u0027s ear over the sound of the band, she said, \"I thought you said she was French.\" \"She speaks French,\" he corrected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But she\u0027s German.\" Flick was bitterly disappointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was no good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreta would have just as much of a German accent when she spoke French.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe audience loved Greta, clapping each number enthusiastically, cheering and whistling when she accompanied the music with bump-and-grind movements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Flick could not relax and enjoy the show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was too worried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe still did not have her telephone engineer, and she had wasted the latter half of the evening coming here on a wild-goose chase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what was she going to do? She wondered how long it would take her to pick up the rudiments of telephone engineering herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had no difficulty with technical things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had built a radio at school.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, she needed to know only enough to destroy the equipment effectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould she do a two-day course, maybe with some people from the General Post Office? The trouble was, nobody could be quite sure what kind of equipment the saboteurs would find when they entered the chateau.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt could be French or German or a mixture, possibly even including imported American machinery-the U.S.A.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas far ahead of France in phone technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were many kinds of equipment, and the chateau served several different functions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had a manual exchange, an automatic exchange, a tandem exchange for connecting other exchanges to one another, and an amplification station for the all-important new trunk route to Germany.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut only an experienced engineer could be confident of recognizing whatever he saw when he walked in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were engineers in France, of course, and she might find a woman-if she had time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not a promising idea, but she thought it through.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSOE could send a message to every Resistance circuit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf there was a woman who could fit the bill, it would take her a day or two to get to Reims, which was all right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the plan was so uncertain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas there a woman telephone engineer in the French Resistance? If not, Flick would waste two days to learn that the mission was doomed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, she needed something more sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought again about Greta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could not pass for French.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Gestapo might not notice her accent, since they spoke French the same way, but the French police would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDid she have to pretend to be French? There were plenty of German women in France: officers\u0027 wives, young women in the armed services, drivers and typists and wireless operators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick began to feel excited again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy not? Greta could pose as an army secretary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, that could cause problems-an officer might start giving her orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be safer for her to pose as a civilian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could be the young wife of an officer, living with her husband in Paris-no, Vichy, it was farther away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere would have to be a story about why Greta was traveling with a group of French women.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps one of the team could pose as her French maid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat about when they entered the chateau? Flick was pretty sure there were no German women working as cleaners in France.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could Greta evade suspicion? Once again, Germans probably would not notice her accent, but French people would.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould she avoid speaking to any French people? Pretend she had laryngitis? She might be able to get away with it for a few minutes, Flick thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was not exactly watertight, but it was better than any other option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreta finished her act with a hilariously suggestive blues song called \"Kitchen Man,\" full of double-entendres.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe audience loved the line: \"When I eat his doughnuts, all I leave is the hole.\" She left the stage to gales of applause.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark got up, saying, \"We can talk to her in her dressing room.\" Flick followed him through a door beside the stage, down a smelly concrete corridor, into a dingy area crammed with cardboard boxes of beer and gin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was like the cellar of a run-down pub.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey came to a door that had a pink paper cutout star fixed to it with thumb- tacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark knocked and opened it without waiting for a reply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tiny room had a dressing table, a mirror surrounded by bright makeup lights, a stool, and a movie poster showing Greta Garbo in Two-Faced Woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn elaborate blonde wig rested on a stand shaped like a head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe red dress Greta had worn on stage hung from a hook on the wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting on the stool in front of the mirror, Flick saw, to her utter astonishment, was a young man with a hairy chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gasped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Greta, no question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe face was heavily made up, with vivid lipstick and false eyelashes, plucked eyebrows, and a layer of makeup hiding the shadow of a dark beard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hair was cut brutally short, no doubt to accommodate the wig.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe false bosom was presumably fixed inside the dress, but Greta still wore a half-slip, stockings, and red high-heeled shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick rounded on Mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You didn\u0027t tell me!\" she accused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed delightedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Flick, meet Gerhard,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He loves it when people don\u0027t realize.\" Flick saw that Gerhard was looking pleased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course he would be happy that she had taken him for a real woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a tribute to his art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe did not need to worry that she had insulted him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd she needed a woman telephone engineer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFlick was painfully disappointed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreta would have been the last piece in the jigsaw, the woman who made the team complete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the mission was in doubt again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was angry with Mark.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This was so mean of you!\" she said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you\u0027d solved my problem, but you were just playing a joke.\" \"It\u0027s not a joke,\" Mark said indignantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you need a woman, take Greta.\" \"I couldn\u0027t,\" Flick said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a ridiculous idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOr was it?
