From this night forward, she would be his. He would watch over her, protect her. He would destroy her enemies, destroy himself rather than allow anyone to harm her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the hour before dawn, he made love to her again, and then, too soon, the sun was climbing over the horizon. He gazed at her for a few more minutes, reluctant to leave her, knowing he must.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you a basement?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara frowned at his odd question. \"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An attic, perhaps?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s a small crawl space in the ceiling above my closet.

I hate having to leave you after we\u0027ve made love. It makes me feel like a... a...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes darkened. \"Like what, Sara? A puttana?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, if you must know! I want to go to sleep in your arms.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You won\u0027t like waking up next to a corpse.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re not a corpse!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s exactly what I am,\" he said with a weary shake of his head. \"You still don\u0027t understand, do you? I\u0027m not alive. I haven\u0027t been alive for over three hundred years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop it!\" She pressed her hands over her ears, refusing to listen. She knew what he was. How could she not? But why did he have to dwell on it? Why wouldn\u0027t he let her forget?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel took a deep breath, his hands clenched at his sides as he fought down his anger, his frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry, Sara,\" he said quietly. \"Forgive me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded, her eyes brimming with tears. \"I only want to be with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. Don\u0027t you think I want it, too?\" His gaze met hers and she saw the anguish in his eyes. \"Don\u0027t you think I\u0027d love to fall asleep beside you, to have your face be the first thing I see when I awake?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We could go away,\" she said. \"I could sleep during the day and spend my nights with you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that what you want, to give up dancing, to give up all you\u0027ve worked for, to be with me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was tempting. For a moment, he let himself imagine what it would be like to have Sara there beside him, to fall asleep in her arms, to reach for her when he awoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he had to give her a chance to think it through, to fully understand what kind of life she would have if she chose to stay with him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a young woman, Sara. You have your whole life ahead of you. Think of what you\u0027d be giving up. You\u0027ll never have a normal life if you decide to stay with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran his fingertips over her cheek, loving the warmth of her skin, wishing, as he had wished so many times before, that he was a mortal man again, that he could live with her and love her as he yearned to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked deep into her eyes. \"Once you are truly mine, I will never let you go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe possessiveness in his gaze, the intensity in voice, gave her a moment\u0027s pause. He was telling her, warning her, that if she decided to stay with him, her decision, once made, would be irrevocable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe saw the sudden apprehension rise in her eyes, knew the very moment when she remembered that he was no ordinary man, that she wouldn\u0027t be able to decide she\u0027d made a mistake and walk away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll talk more about it later,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara nodded. Reaching for her robe, she slid out of bed and began gathering the clothes she\u0027d need for the day. As an afterthought, she took the little silver cross from her jewelry box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Till tonight,\" she said, kissing his cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor Sara, the daylight hours passed slowly. She had little to occupy her time since she dared not go outside alone. After eating breakfast and washing her few dishes, she wandered through the apartment, finally settling down on the sofa with a book. But she couldn\u0027t concentrate. She kept hearing Gabriel\u0027s words in her mind: Once you are truly mine, I\u0027ll never let you go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWasn\u0027t that what she wanted, to be his forever?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat there for hours, her mind replaying every moment they had spent together, weighing her love for him, her need to be with him, against her desire to continue dancing, to have a home and a family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou\u0027ll never have a normal life if you stay with me, he\u0027d said. But did she want a normal life if she couldn\u0027t share it with Gabriel?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could she live with him, knowing what he did to survive? How could she live without him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow would she feel as the years passed by and she grew old, older, while he stayed forever young? Would she hate him then? Would he turn away from her when she was no longer young and pretty?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could become what he was...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glanced at the bedroom door, and after a long moment of indecision, she did what she had been longing to do, what she had promised not to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne hand clasping the cross she had slipped over her head when she left the room earlier, she opened the bedroom door a crack and peered inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel had dressed and now lay upon his cloak, his arms folded over his chest, his eyes closed. His skin looked more pale than usual. She stared at him for a long moment, but he didn\u0027t appear to be breathing. He looked, she thought morbidly, like a corpse laid out for burial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not alive, he\u0027d said, and for the first time she believed him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sound behind her made her start, and she whirled around to find Maurice standing in the doorway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing here?\" she whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaurice glanced at Gabriel, then shook his head. \"I knew it,\" he murmured. \"I knew he had come back. There was no other explanation for the way you\u0027ve been acting these past few days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara crossed the floor toward the door, but Maurice held his ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now do you believe me?\" he said, nodding in Gabriel\u0027s direction. \"The man\u0027s a vampire, Sara Jayne. He must be destroyed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to close the door, but Maurice grabbed her by the arm and half dragged, half carried her into the room Babette had used. Taking the key from the lock, he shoved Sara inside and locked the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maurice!\" Sara pounded on the door with her fists. \"Maurice, let me out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, Sara Jayne. He must be destroyed, now, while he\u0027s helpless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maurice!\" She screamed his name. \"Don\u0027t!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring her cries, Maurice went outside and retrieved the sack he\u0027d left on the steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReentering the house, he opened the sack, his hand clutching the cross he wore while he gazed at the contents, quietly praying for the courage to do what had to be done. And then, heaving a determined sigh, he withdrew a sharp wooden stake and a hammer from the sack and went into Sara\u0027s bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel lay as before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnmoving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUndead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear rose up in Maurice as he gazed at the man on the bed. Not a man, he reminded himself, a monster, a fiend who lived off the blood of others, a demon who must be destroyed before he turned Sara Jayne into what he was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the thought of Sara that gave Maurice the courage to lift the stake. He could hear Sara Jayne pounding on the door, screaming for him to stop, as he positioned the sharpened end of the hawthorn stake over Gabriel\u0027s heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHolding his breath, he raised the hammer, his gorge rising at the mere idea of what he was about to do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was bringing the hammer down when Gabriel\u0027s hand closed around his forearm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hammer fell from a hand gone suddenly numb as Maurice stared down into the face of death. Gabriel\u0027s eyes blazed with an unholy fire; his lips were drawn back in a feral snarl, revealing sharp white fangs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his free hand, Gabriel tore the cross from the chain dangling down Maurice\u0027s chest. The silver burned his palm as he threw the crucifix across the room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you think to kill me so easily?\" Gabriel asked as he tossed the stake after the crucifix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaurice couldn\u0027t speak. Cold sweat beaded his brow and trickled down his back as he stared at the monster lying on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara\u0027s voice, crying, pleading, filled the silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What have you done to her?\" Gabriel asked, his voice low and silky and dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaurice opened his mouth, but no words came out, and he shook his head vigorously, his whole body trembling. He winced as Gabriel tightened his hold on his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fool,\" Gabriel said. \"Did you truly think a puny mortal like yourself could destroy me? I\u0027ve survived for over three hundred and fifty years, little man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But...\" The word squeaked past Maurice\u0027s lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You thought to find me helpless,\" Gabriel mused. \"You should not have put your faith in those silly stories about vampires. Only the very young ones are totally helpless during the hours of daylight.\" A wry grin twisted Gabriel\u0027s lips. \"As you are helpless.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel arched one brow. \"You don\u0027t wish to die?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither do I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaurice licked lips gone dry. Gabriel was toying with him as a cat might play with a mouse before the kill. He tried to look away from those horrible blood-red eyes, but he couldn\u0027t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDrawing Maurice closer, Gabriel reached up with his free hand and wrapped his fingers around Maurice\u0027s throat. He could feel the blood rushing through the man\u0027s veins, smell the overpowering scent of fear that rose from every pore. He had not fed in several days...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you ever thought of being dinner?\" he asked mildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaurice shook his head, his stomach churning at the thought of Gabriel feeding on his blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel grunted softly. \"Have you ever thought of being a vampire? I could arrange it, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Careful, little man,\" Gabriel warned. \"You\u0027re in no position to offend me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaurice glared at him, his eyes filled with fear and defiance. \"Go ahead, kill me, you bastard, but do it and get it over with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel regarded Delacroix for a long while, faintly amused by the man\u0027s unexpected show of courage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not going to kill you,\" he said, loosening his hold on Maurice\u0027s throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHorror darkened Maurice\u0027s eyes. \"You don\u0027t mean to turn me into what you are?\" He shook his head. \"I would rather be dead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen to me, Delacroix, listen very carefully. Sara\u0027s life is in danger.\" He saw the accusation in Maurice\u0027s eyes. \"Not from me, but from another vampire. A very old, very vindictive vampire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no reason you should. Suffice it to say that I\u0027m afraid of her...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027re afraid of her?\" Maurice asked incredulously, unable to believe that Gabriel was afraid of anything, living or dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The female of the species is always more dangerous, more deadly. Nina is vexed with me, and she intends to get even with me by hurting Sara. I can\u0027t protect Sara from Nina during the day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What can I do against a vampire?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nina is no threat during the day. But she\u0027s been known to hypnotize others to do her bidding. And that, my friend, is where you come in. I\u0027m letting you live so you can protect Sara while I rest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand.\" Maurice swallowed hard. \"And when the threat to Sara is past, what then? Will you kill me for what I tried to do today?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Only if you try it again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what of Sara?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren\u0027t... you wouldn\u0027t...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Make her what I am? No, I would never do that.\" With a sigh, Gabriel released his hold on Maurice\u0027s arm. \"Get out. And take your cross with you. You might have need of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a nod, Maurice scooped up the crucifix and fled the room. Closing the door behind him, he slid to the ground, the heavy silver cross clutched tightly in his hands. Never, he thought, never had he been so afraid. So close to death. Or worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGradually, he became aware of Sara\u0027s cries. Pushing himself to his feet, he walked on unsteady legs to the bedroom and unlocked the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara studied Maurice\u0027s face, her heart heavy in her breast. \"Did you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, thank God,\" Sara murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe started to step past Maurice when he caught her arm. \"I thought he was going to kill me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara\u0027s eyes widened. \"What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He woke up when I put the stake to his heart.\" Maurice shivered with the memory. \"I\u0027ve never seen anything so awful as the look in his eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara nodded. She, too, had seen that look. It had chilled her to the depths of her soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He could have killed me,\" Maurice said, \"but he let me live because of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking her hand, Maurice led her into the parlor and sank down on the sofa. \"He told me about Nina, said I was to protect you during the day.\" Maurice paused, willing his hands to stop trembling, but he couldn\u0027t shake off the fear that had gripped him. \"What are we going to do, Sara Jayne?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaurice glanced around the room, at the garlic hanging from the windows and over the door. \"Do you really think that will keep her out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It kept Gabriel inside the cottage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but from what he says, Nina is stronger than he is. What if she\u0027s immune to something as mundane as garlic?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sprinkled the windowsills with holy water, too. I don\u0027t care how strong she is, I don\u0027t think she can cross that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And if she can?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know!\" Sara jumped to her feet and began to pace the floor. \"I\u0027m just as frightened as you are.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer words were like a slap in the face. Squaring his shoulders, Maurice stood up and gathered Sara into his arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll protect you with my life, Sara Jayne,\" he said quietly. \"I swear it on the life of my mother.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/embrace-the-night/page-23.html","bookId":2307,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:00 PM"}
