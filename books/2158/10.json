They will know my plan in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt required constant mental cleansing to face up to the fact of her great power over the Sisterhood. I did not seek this power. It was thrust upon me. And she thought: Power attracts the corruptible. Suspect all who seek it. She knew the chances were great that such people were susceptible to corruption or already lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade made a mental note to scribe and transmit a Coda memo to Archives. (Let Bell sweat this one!) \"We should grant power over our affairs only to those who are reluctant to hold it and then only under conditions that increase the reluctance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerfect description of the Bene Gesserit!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you well, Dar?\" It was Bellonda\u0027s voice from the tube door beside Odrade. \"You look... strange.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just thought of something to do. You getting off?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBellonda stared at her as they exchanged places. The tubefield caught Odrade and whisked her away from that questioning gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade entered the workroom and saw her table piled with things her aides thought only she could resolve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolitics, she recalled as she sat at her table and prepared to deal with responsibilities. Tam and Bell had heard her clearly the other day but they had only the vaguest idea of what they would be asked to support. They were worried and increasingly watchful. As they should be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost any subject had political elements, she thought. As emotions were whipped up, political forces came more and more into the foreground. This put lie! to that old nonsense about \"separation of church and state.\" Nothing more susceptible to emotional heat than religion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo wonder we distrust emotions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot all emotions, of course. Only the ones you could not escape in moments of necessity: love, hate. Let in a little anger sometimes but keep it on a short leash. That was the Sisterhood\u0027s belief. Utter nonsense!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Tyrant\u0027s Golden Path made their mistake no longer tolerable. The Golden Path left the Bene Gesserit in a perpetual backwater. You could not minister to Infinity!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBell\u0027s recurrent question had no answer. \"What did he really want us to do?\" Into what actions was he manipulating us? (As we manipulate others!) Why look for meaning where there is none? Would you follow a path you knew led nowhere?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGolden Path! A track laid down in one imagination. Infinity is nowhere! And the finite mind balked. Here was where Mentats found mutable projections, always producing more questions than answers. It was the empty grail of those who, noses close to an endless circle, looked for \"the one answer to all things.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking for their own kind of gad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe found it hard to censure them. The mind recoiled in the face of infinity. The Void! Alchemists of any age were like rag pickers bent over their bundles, saying: \"There must be order in here somewhere. If I keep on, I\u0027m sure to find it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd all the time, the only order was the order they themselves created.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhhh, Tyrant! You droll fellow. You saw it. You said: \"I will create order for you to follow. Here is the path. See it? No! Don\u0027t look over there. That is the way of the Emperor-Without-Clothes (a nakedness apparent only to children and the insane). Keep your attention where I direct it. This is my Golden Path. Isn\u0027t that a pretty name? It\u0027s all there is and all there ever will be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTyrant, you were another clown. Pointing us into endless recycling of cells from that lost and lonely ball of dirt in our common past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou knew the human universe could never be more than communities and weak glue binding us when we Scattered. A common birth tradition so far away in our past that pictures of it carried by descendants are mostly distorted. Reverend Mothers carry the original, but we cannot force it onto unwilling people. You see, Tyrant? We heard you: \"Let them come asking for it! Then, and only then...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that was why you preserved us, you Atreides bastard! That\u0027s why I must get to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the peril to her sense of humanity, she knew she would continue to insinuate herself into the ways of Honored Matres. I must think as they think.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hunters\u0027 problem: predator and prey shared it. Not quite needle-in-the-haystack. More a question of tracking across a terrain littered with the familiar and the unfamiliar. Bene Gesserit deceptions insured that the familiar would cause Honored Matres at least as much difficulty as the unfamiliar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what have they done for us?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInterplanetary communication worked for the hunted. Limited by economics for millennia. Not much of it except among Important People and Traders. Important meant what it had always meant: rich, powerful; bankers, officials, couriers. Military. \"Important\" labeled many categories - negotiators, entertainers, medical personnel, skilled technicians, spies, and other specialists. It was not much different in kind from the days of the Master Masons on Old Terra. Mainly a difference in numbers, quality and sophistication. Boundaries were transparent to some as they had always been.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt it important to review this occasionally, looking for flaws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe great mass of planet-bound humanity spoke of \"the silence of space,\" meaning they could not afford the cost of such travel or communication. Most people knew the news they received across this barrier was managed for special interests. It had always been that way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a planet, terrain and avoiding telltale radiation dictated the communications systems used: tubes, messengers, lightlines, nerve riders and many permutations. Secrecy and encryption were important, not only between planets but on them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade saw it as a system Honored Matres could tap if they found an entry point. Hunters had to begin by deciphering the system, but then: Where did a trail to Chapterhouse originate?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntrackable no-ships, Ixian machines, and Guild Navigators - all contributed to the blanket of silence between planets except for the privileged few. Give hunters no starting points!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt came as a surprise then when an aging Reverend Mother from a Bene Gesserit punishment planet appeared at Mother Superior\u0027s workroom shortly before the lunch break. Archives identified her: Name: Dortujla. Sent to special perdition years ago for an unforgivable infraction. Memory said it had been a love affair of some kind. Odrade did not ask for details. Some of them were displayed anyway. (Bellonda interfering again!) Emotional upheaval at the time of Dortujla\u0027s banishment, Odrade noted. Futile attempts by the lover to prevent separation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade recalled gossip about Dortujla\u0027s disgrace. \"The Jessica crime!\" Much valuable information arrived via gossip. Where the devil had Dortujla been posted? Never mind. Not important at the moment. More important: Why is she here? Why did she dare a trip that might lead the hunters to us?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade asked Streggi when she announced the arrival. Streggi did not know. \"She says what she must reveal is for your ears alone, Mother Superior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alone?\" Odrade almost chuckled, considering the constant monitoring (surveillance was a better term) of her every action. \"This Dortujla has not said why she is here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The ones who told me to interrupt you, Mother Superior, said they thought you should see her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade pursed her lips. The fact that the banished Reverend Mother had penetrated this far aroused Odrade\u0027s curiosity. A persistent Reverend Mother could cross ordinary barriers but these barriers were not ordinary. Dortujla\u0027s reason for coming already had been told. Others had heard and passed her. It was apparent that Dortujla had not relied on Bene Gesserit wiles to persuade her Sisters. That would have brought immediate rejection. No time for such nonsense! So she had observed the chain of command. Her action spoke of careful assessment, a message within whatever message she brought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bring her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDortujla had aged smoothly on her backwater planet. She revealed her years mostly in shallow wrinkles around her mouth. The hood of her robe concealed her hair but the eyes peering from beneath it were bright and alert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are you here?\" Odrade\u0027s tone said: \"This had damned well better be important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDortujla\u0027s story was straightforward enough. She and three Reverend Mother associates had spoken to a band of Futars from the Scattering. Dortujla\u0027s post had been searched out and asked to get a message to Chapterhouse. Dortujla had filtered the request through Truthsense, she said, reminding Mother Superior that even in backwaters there could be some talent. Judging the message truthful, her Sisters concurring, Dortujla had acted with speed, not unmindful of caution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All due dispatch in our own no-ship,\" was the way she put it. The ship, she said, was small, a smuggler type.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One person can operate it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe heart of the message was fascinating. Futars wished to ally themselves with Reverend Mothers in opposition to Honored Matres. How much of a force these Futars commanded was difficult to assess, Dortujla said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They refused to say when I asked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade had assessed many stories about Futars. Killers of Honored Matres? There were reasons to believe it but Futar performance was confusing, especially in accounts from Gammu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How many in this party?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sixteen Futars and four Handlers. That\u0027s what they called themselves: Handlers. And they say Honored Matres have a dangerous weapon they can use only once.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You only mentioned Futars. Who are these Handlers? And what is this about a secret weapon?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I reserved mention of them. They appear to be human within variables noted from the Scattering: three men and a woman. As to the weapon, they would not say more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Appear to be human?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you have it, Mother Superior. I had the odd first impression they were Face Dancers. None of the criteria applied. Pheromones negative. Gestures, expressions - everything negative.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just that first impression?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I cannot explain it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What of the Futars?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They matched the descriptions. Human in outward appearance but with unmistakable ferocity. Cat family origins, I would judge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So others have said.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They speak but it\u0027s an abbreviated Galach. Word bursts, I thought them. \u0027When eat?\u0027 \u0027You nice lady.\u0027 \u0027Want head scratch.\u0027 \u0027Sit here?\u0027 They appeared immediately responsive to the Handlers but not fearful. Between Futars and Handlers I had the impression there was mutual respect and liking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Knowing the risks, why did you think this important enough to bring immediately?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These are people from the Scattering. Their offer of alliance is an opening into places where Honored Matres originate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You asked about them, of course. And about conditions in the Scattering. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No answers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fact, simply stated. One could not sneer at the banished Sister no matter how much of a cloud she carried over her past. More questions were indicated. Odrade asked them, observing closely as answers came, watching the old mouth like a withered fruit opening purple and closing pink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething in Dortujla\u0027s service, the long years of penitence perhaps, had gentled her but left the core of Bene Gesserit toughness untouched. She spoke with natural hesitancy. Her gestures were softly fluid. She looked at Odrade with kindness. (There was the flaw her Sisters condemned: Bene Gesserit cynicism held at bay.) Dortujla interested Odrade. Sister to Sister, she spoke, a strong and well-composed mind behind her words. A mind toughened by adversity in the years at a punishment post. Doing what she could now to make up for that lapse of her youth. No attempt to appear some time-server not up on current affairs. An account pared to essentials. Let it be known that she had as full as possible an awareness of necessities. Bowed to Mother Superior\u0027s decisions and caution about the dangerous visit but still felt that \"you should have this information.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m convinced it\u0027s not a trap.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDortujla\u0027s demeanor was above reproach. Direct gaze, eyes and face held in proper composure but no attempts at concealment. A Sister could read through this mask for a proper assessment. Dortujla acted from a sense of urgency. She had been a fool once but she no longer was a fool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was the name of her punishment planet?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe worktable\u0027s projector produced it: Buzzell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat name brought an alertness to Odrade. Buzzell! Her fingers danced in the console, confirming memories. Buzzell: mostly ocean. Cold. Very cold. Hardscrabble islands, none bigger than a large no-ship. The Bene Gesserit once had considered Buzzell a punishment. Object lesson: \"Careful, girl, or you\u0027ll be sent to Buzzell.\" Odrade recalled the other key then: soostones. Buzzell was a place where they had naturalized the monoped sea creature, Cholister, whose abraded carapace produced marvelous tumors, one of the most valued jewels in the universe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoostones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDortujla was wearing one of the things just visible above the tuck of her neckline. The workroom light turned it an elegant blend of deeply glowing sea-green and mauve. It was larger than a human eyeball, flaunted there like a declaration of wealth. They probably thought little of such decorations on Buzzell. Pick them up on the beaches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoostones. That was significant. By Bene Gesserit design, Dortujla had frequent dealings with smugglers. (Witness her possession of that no-ship.) This must be addressed with care. No matter the Sister-to-Sister discussion, it was still Mother Superior and Reverend Mother from a punishment planet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmuggling. A major crime to Honored Matres and others who had not faced the fact of unenforceable laws. Foldspace had not changed it for smuggling, just made small intrusions easier if anything. Tiny no-ships. How small could you make one of them? A gap in Odrade\u0027s knowledge. Archives corrected it: \"Diameter, meters 140.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmall enough, then. Soostones were a cargo with natural attraction. Foldspace was a critical economic barrier: How valuable a cargo compared to size and mass? You could spend many Solaris moving massive stuff. Soostones - magnetic to smugglers. They had special interest to Honored Matres as well. Simple economics? Always a big market. As attractive to smugglers as melange now that the Guild was being so free with it. The Guild had always stockpiled with generations of spice in scattered storage and (doubtless) many hidden backups.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey think they can buy immunity from Honored Matres! But that offered something she sensed might be turned to advantage. In their wild anger, Honored Matres had destroyed Dune, only known natural source of melange. Still unthinking of consequences (odd, that), they had eliminated the Tleilaxu, whose axlotl tanks had flooded the Old Empire with spice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we have creatures capable of recreating Dune. We also may have the only living Tleilaxu Master. Locked in Scytale\u0027s mind - the way to turn axlotl tanks into a melange cornucopia. If we can get him to reveal it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe immediate problem was Dortujla. The woman conveyed her ideas with a conciseness that did her credit. Handlers and their Futars, she said, were disturbed by something they would not reveal. Dortujla had been wise not to attempt Bene Gesserit persuasives. No telling how people from the Scattering might react. But what disturbed them?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some threat other than Honored Matres,\" Dortujla suggested. She would not venture more but the possibility was there and had to be considered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The essential thing is that they say they want an alliance,\" Odrade said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Common cause for a common problem,\" was the way they had put it. Despite Truthsense, Dortujla advised only a cautious exploration of the offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy go to Buzzell at all? Because Honored Matres had missed Buzzell or judged it insignificant in their angry sweeps?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not likely,\" Dortujla said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade agreed. Dortujla, no matter how grubby her original posting, now commanded a valuable property and, much more important, she was a Reverend Mother with a no-ship to take her to Mother Superior. She knew the location of Chapterhouse. Useless to the hunters, of course. They knew a Reverend Mother would kill herself before betraying that secret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProblems compounded problems. But first, some Sisterly sharing. Dortujla was sure to make a correct interpretation of Mother Superior\u0027s motives. Odrade shifted the conversation into personal matters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt went well. Dortujla was clearly amused but willing to talk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReverend Mothers on lonely posts tended to have what Sisters called \"other interests.\" An earlier age had called them hobbies but attention devoted to interests often was extreme. Odrade thought most interests boring but found it significant that Dortujla called hers a hobby. She collected old coins, did she?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have two early Greek in silver and a perfect gold obol.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Authentic?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re real.\" Meaning she had done a self-scan of Other Memory to authenticate them. Fascinating. She exercised her abilities in a strengthening way, even with her hobby. Inner history and exterior coincided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is all very interesting, Mother Superior,\" Dortujla said finally. \"I appreciate your reassurance that we are still Sisters and find your interest in ancient paintings a parallel hobby. But we both know why I risked coming here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The smugglers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course. Honored Matres cannot have overlooked my presence on Buzzell. Smugglers will sell to the high bidders. We must assume they have profited from their valuable knowledge about Buzzell, the soostones, and a resident Reverend Mother with attendants. And we must not forget that Handlers found me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamn! Odrade thought. Dortujla is the kind of advisor I like to have near me. I wonder how many more such buried treasures are out there, tucked away for mean motives? Why do we so often shunt our talented ones aside? It\u0027s an ancient weakness the Sisterhood has not exorcised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think we have learned something valuable about Honored Matres,\" Dortujla said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no need to nod agreement. This was the core of what had brought Dortujla to Chapterhouse. The ravening hunters had come swarming into the Old Empire, killing and burning wherever they suspected the presence of Bene Gesserit establishments. But the hunters had not touched Buzzell even though its location must be known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Odrade asked, voicing what was in their minds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never damage your own nest,\" Dortujla said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think they\u0027re already on Buzzell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you believe Buzzell is a place they want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Prime projection.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade merely stared at her. So Dortujla had another hobby! She burrowed into Other Memory, revived and perfected talents stored there. Who could blame her? Time must drag on Buzzell.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A Mentat summation,\" Odrade accused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, Mother Superior.\" Very meek. Reverend Mothers were supposed to dig into Other Memory this way only with Chapterhouse permission and then only with guidance and support from companion Sisters. So Dortujla remained a rebel. She followed her own desires the way she had with her forbidden lover. Good! The Bene Gesserit needed such rebels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They want Buzzell undamaged,\" Dortujla said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A water world?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would make a suitable home for amphibian servants. Not the Futars or Handlers. I studied them carefully.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe evidence suggested a plan by Honored Matres to bring in enslaved servants, amphibians perhaps, to harvest soostones. Honored Matres could have amphibian slaves. Knowledge that produced Futars might create many forms of sentient life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Slaves, dangerous imbalance,\" Odrade said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDortujla showed her first strong emotion, deep revulsion that drew her mouth into a tight line.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a pattern the Sisterhood had long recognized: the inevitable failure of slavery and peonage. You created a reservoir of hate. Implacable enemies. If you had no hope of exterminating all of these enemies, you dared not try. Temper your efforts by the sure awareness that oppression will make your enemies strong. The oppressed will have their day and heaven help the oppressor when that day comes. It was a two-edged blade. The oppressed always learned from and copied the oppressor. When the tables were turned, the stage was set for another round of revenge and violence - roles reversed. And reversed and reversed ad nauseam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will they never mature?\" Odrade asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDortujla had no answer but she did have an immediate suggestion. \"I must return to Buzzell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOdrade considered this. Once more, the banished Reverend Mother was ahead of Mother Superior. As disagreeable as the decision was, they both knew it as their best move. Futars and Handlers would return. More important, with a planet Honored Matres desired, odds were high that visitors from the Scattering had been observed. Honored Matres would have to make a move and that move could reveal much about them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, they think Buzzell is bait for a trap,\" Odrade said. \" I could let it be known that I was banished by my Sisters,\" Dortujla said. \"It can be verified.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Use yourself as bait?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother Superior, what if they could be tempted into a parley?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With us?\" What a startling idea!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know their history is not one of reasonable negotiations but still... \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s brilliant! But let us make it even more enticing. Say I am convinced I must come to them with a proposal for submission of the Bene Gesserit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mother Superior!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have no intention of surrendering. But what better way to get them to talk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buzzell is not a good place for a meeting. Our facilities are very poor.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They are on junction in force. If they suggested junction as a meeting place, could you let yourself be persuaded?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would take careful planning, Mother Superior.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, very careful.\" Odrade\u0027s fingers flickered in her console. \"Yes, tonight,\" she said answering a visible question, and then, speaking to Dortujla across the cluttered worktable: \"I want you to meet with my Council and others before you return. We will brief you thoroughly but I give you my personal assurance you will have an open assignment. The important thing is to get them to a meeting on junction... and I hope you know how much I dislike using you as bait. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Dortujla remained deep in thought and not responding, Odrade said: \"They may ignore our overtures and wipe you out. Still, you\u0027re the best bait we have.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDortujla showed she still had her sense of humor. \"I don\u0027t much like the idea of dangling on a hook myself, Mother Superior. Please keep a firm grip on the line.\" She stood and with a worried look at the work on Odrade\u0027s table, said: \"You have so much to do and I fear I have kept you far past lunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We will dine here together, Sister. For the moment, you are more important than anything else.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll states are abstractions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Octun Politicus, BG Archives\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucilla cautioned herself not to assume too familiar a feeling about this acid-green room and the recurring presence of Great Honored Matre. This was junction, stronghold of the ones who sought extermination of the Rene Gesserit. This was the enemy. Day seventeen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe infallible mental clock that had been set ticking during the Spice Agony told her she had adapted to the planet\u0027s circadian rhythms. Awake at dawn. No telling when she would be fed. Honored Matre confined her to one meal a day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd always that Futar in its cage. A reminder: Both of you in cages. This is how we treat dangerous animals. We may let them out occasionally to stretch their legs and give us pleasure but back to the cage afterward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMinimal amounts of melange in the food. Not being parsimonious. Not with their wealth. A small show of \"what could be yours if you would only be reasonable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen will she come today?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat Honored Matre arrivals had no set time. Random appearances to confuse the captive? Probably. There would be other demands on a commander\u0027s time. Fit the dangerous pet into the regular schedule wherever you could.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI may be dangerous, Spider Lady, but I am not your pet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucilla felt the presence of scanning devices, things that did more than provide stimulus for eyes. These looked into flesh, probing for concealed weapons, for the functioning of organs. Does she have strange implants? What about additional organs surgically added to her body?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNone of those, Madame Spider. We rely on things that come with birth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucilla knew her greatest immediate danger - that she would feel inadequate in such a setting. Her captors had her at a terrible disadvantage but they had not destroyed her Bene Gesserit capabilities. She could will herself to die before the shere in her body was depleted to the point of betrayal. She still had her mind... and the horde from Lampadas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Futar panel opened and it came sliding out in its cage. So Spider Queen was on her way. Displaying threat ahead of her as usual. Early today. Earlier than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning, Futar.\" Lucilla spoke with a merry lilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Futar looked at her but did not speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must hate it in that cage,\" Lucilla said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not like cage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had already determined that these creatures possessed a degree of language facility but the extent of it still eluded her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose she keeps you hungry, too. Would you like to eat me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Eat.\" Definite show of interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish I were your Handler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You Handler?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would you obey me if I were?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpider Queen\u0027s heavy chair lifted from its concealment under the floor. No sign of her yet but it had to be assumed she listened to these conversations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Futar stared at Lucilla with peculiar intensity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do Handlers keep you caged and hungry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Handler?\" Clear inflections of a question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want you to kill Great Honored Matre.\" That would be no surprise to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Kill Dama!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And eat her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dama poison.\" Dejected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOoooh.

Her meat is the same as mine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Futar approached her to the cage\u0027s limits. The left hand peeled down its lower lip. Angry redness of a scar there, appearance of a burn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See poison,\" it said, dropping its hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wonder how she did that? No smell of poison about her. Human flesh plus adrenaline-based drug to produce orange eyes in response to anger... and those other responses Murbella revealed. A sense of absolute superiority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow far did Futar comprehension go? \"Was it a bitter poison?\" The Futar grimaced and spat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAction faster and more powerful than words.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you hate Dama?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBared canines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you fear her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSmile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then why don\u0027t you kill her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You not Handler.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt requires a kill command from a Handler!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat Honored Matre entered and sank into her chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLucilla pitched her voice in the merry lilt: \"Good morning, Dama.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did not give you permission to call me that.\" Low and with beginning flecks of orange in the eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Futar and I have been having a conversation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\" More orange in the eyes. \"And if you have spoiled him for me...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But Dama -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t call me that!\" Out of her chair, eyes blazing orange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do sit down,\" Lucilla said. \"This is no way to conduct an interrogation.\" Sarcasm, a dangerous weapon. \"You said yesterday you wanted to continue our discussion of politics.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know what time it is?\" Sinking back in her chair but eyes still flaming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All Bene Gesserit have this ability.
