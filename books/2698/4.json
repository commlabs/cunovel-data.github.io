She opened the front door and stepped inside, thinking that the world had gone mad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, in a way the world had gone mad the day the first shot of the war had been fired. But this was something worse. Worse? What could be worse than a war that was exterminating half the young men of a divided country?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLosing all sanity and all souls.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought came to her unbidden, and she shook it off. But what was happening here was strange. People were behaving differently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody and Jim had literally severed the dead man\u0027s head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you are, Alex!\" Beulah chastised her as she came through from the kitchen, clasping a hand to her heart. \"Don\u0027t you go round worrying me so now, young lady, do you hear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex stared at her. \"Beulah, I was right down the street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe so, but you need to be inside now. It\u0027s dark, and the moon...well, the moon is out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex smiled, giving her a hug and wondering what the moon had to do with anything. \"I\u0027m fine. The bad guys got sent away with their tails between their legs. Tonight we\u0027re all safe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeulah drew back, shaking her head sadly. \"Honey child, no time is safe anymore. But darkness? It\u0027s not safe at all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex stared at the older woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beulah, what\u0027s going on here?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evil,\" Beulah said sagely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evil?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bad things, very bad things. It\u0027s like the devil himself is trying to take hold here. Oh, honey, I don\u0027t know everything. But it\u0027s like an evil disease. So we just stay inside. Oh, Lordy! Brigsby gone. And Hollow Tree, too, I hear tell...and now Victory. Maybe we thought we\u0027d be spared. Maybe we felt we couldn\u0027t do a thing about it \u0027cept run, and for too many folks, this is all we have and there ain\u0027t nowhere to run to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beulah, I don\u0027t understand you,\" Alex said impatiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t rightly understand it myself,\" Beulah said, then smiled suddenly, her eyes lighting up. \"But tonight...well, that was a miracle, it was, those two fellows turning up when they did. And now they\u0027ll be staying here. What a fine thing that is.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeulah made the sign of the cross over her ample chest as she spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex nodded. That much was true. She would definitely feel safer with the men who had successfully defied the outlaws staying in her boardinghouse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly her smile of agreement froze on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had just watched Cody Fox decapitate a dead man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the blessing-no, at the insistence of-of Jim Green.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe realized she was exhausted. No doubt the world would look normal again after a good night\u0027s rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I have to go to sleep,\" she told Beulah.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You need to have something to eat, child,\" Beulah said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex laughed. \"Beulah, you\u0027re a sweetheart, but I\u0027m too tired to eat. I\u0027m going to go up to bed now, and I\u0027ll worry about what\u0027s going on in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s the devil,\" Beulah said, nodding sagely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex took Beulah\u0027s hands. \"I saw the devil\u0027s work when anger and hostility entered the hearts of men and sent them to war.\" Her eyes grew sad. \"I guarantee you, God has no part in the carnage of war. Whatever this is, we can fight it, and we will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe. Now that they\u0027ve come,\" Beulah agreed, then added, \"But maybe not. This evening they came in a roar of gunfire. But sometimes they come in stealth and quiet, slipping into our lives and our souls-like the devil. Please, Alex, you heard what Cody Fox said to them fancy girls. It\u0027s time to be smart and careful.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex gave Beulah a hug. \"I\u0027ll be careful, I swear,\" she promised, and headed for the stairs. Just dragging herself up the steps suddenly seemed like a tremendous effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe made it to her room. Her father\u0027s room. No, her room now, as he would have wanted it to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the girls had laid out her nightdress, and left her a basin of water on the washstand. By rote, she carefully removed and hung her clothing, washed up and slipped on the nightgown. She dipped her hands into the water again to refresh her face, and caught her reflection in the mirror. In the white gown and the lamplight, she appeared gaunt and pale. As if she were some kind of wraith. Despite herself, she found herself thinking of the women in the saloon. Dolly, who was so...assured. That new girl, oddly pretty and fresh. She paled in comparison. She winced. How odd! She wasn\u0027t accustomed to feeling insecure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned again to her reflection and realized she was comparing herself to others because...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of Cody Fox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flood of red heightened her cheeks as she continued staring into the mirror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took her towel and patted her face dry, and turned quickly away from the mirror, feeling ridiculous. The world had gone crazy-and she was worried about being noticed by a man. She definitely needed sleep. Ever since Grant\u0027s death, she hadn\u0027t even thought about men except when she\u0027d volunteered at the hospital, where they\u0027d simply been sad and scared human beings longing to die with the warmth and comfort of a woman\u0027s hand clutching their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe that was it. It had simply been so long since she had buried her fiance, so long since she had even thought about appearances, attraction...and then a man like Cody Fox came along and suddenly she was seeing herself as a woman again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlex let out a sigh of irritation, blew out the lamp and crawled into bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarkness, exhaustion. They would surely allow her to rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she found that her eyes were drawn to the double French doors that led from the master suite to the balcony. The moon wasn\u0027t full, but still there was a flood of light falling to earth from the heavens, a yellow glow permeating the world beyond her windows, making its way through the drapes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBathed in that glow, shadows moved. They looked like the wings of birds, giant birds dancing in the air beyond the window. She almost thought she could hear the rush of wings, but she knew it was only the sound of the wind as it rushed over the plain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe forced herself to close her eyes, and at last she slept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHEY WERE IN THE ACT of burying the decapitated man when the sheriff and his deputy made it back into town at last.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sheriff, Cole Granger, was a tall, hard-muscled man with sharp blue eyes and hair so dark it had a blue sheen in the moonlight. His deputy, Dave Hinton, was smaller, but he had a solid handshake and steady eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJim Green explained what had happened when Milo and his band of outlaws had come to town.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"These fellows saved us, and that\u0027s a fact,\" he said, then cleared his throat, kicking at the freshly dug mound of earth below his feet. \"Honest, Cole, we weren\u0027t being cowards-we just didn\u0027t know what to do, you know? Ace Henley got this fellow, though. We don\u0027t have a name for him, don\u0027t know nothing about him. But we\u0027ve taken care of him-and we\u0027ve buried him deep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Damn it, damn it all straight to hell!\" Granger said, sounding disgusted with himself. \"I shouldn\u0027t have ridden out, and I sure as hell shouldn\u0027t have taken Dave with me.\" He looked Cody and Brendan in the eyes. \"Thank you. I don\u0027t know how the hell you did it, but thank you. There\u0027d been trouble out at John Snow\u0027s trading post-and I had to get out there, see what was going on. But I didn\u0027t count on getting back so late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We hit some trouble on the return,\" Dave said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trouble? What happened?\" Cody asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Darnedest thing,\" Cole said, shaking his head. \"We were coming through a patch of brush and trees about five miles from here when the horses just went crazy. Go figure. We\u0027ve both been riding since before we could walk, and first we lose Dave\u0027s horse, and he\u0027s running around like a headless chicken till I can catch him and start to get him settled. Next thing you know, my Titan is rearing and snorting, and starting Dave\u0027s horse going again. There was something out there, but damned if I know what. Wolves, coyotes, something. All I know is, I\u0027ve never seen horses acting up so badly.\" Cole stopped speaking and looked Cody in the eye again. \"Everyone is saying the devil is loose in these parts. I don\u0027t know what the devil is, but there\u0027s sure as hell something going on. Something that lets Milo and his crew annihilate whole towns. I figured they\u0027d be coming for us sooner or later. It\u0027s just sooner than I expected.\" He looked from Cody to Brendan, and back to Cody. \"How the hell did you stop him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know Milo\u0027s type,\" Cody said. \"I know how to make him believe that he\u0027ll lose his own life if he doesn\u0027t listen to me. I know this kind of enemy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We finished decapitating the dead man,\" Jim Green put in nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole set a hand on Jim Green\u0027s shoulder. \"If you feel it was necessary, Jim, then that\u0027s fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolutely right,\" Dave agreed, shaking his head strenuously. Cody and Brendan exchanged a look. It was obvious that Dave thought the very devil was walking the streets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole Granger was a harder man altogether, and his attitude said he\u0027d seen his share of vicious men. He clearly still believed that he was dealing with something real and tangible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"With everything going on out here,\" Cody said, \"haven\u0027t you gotten any help from the army or the U.S. Marshals?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole Granger shook his head. \"If we\u0027d ever suspected we could all be wiped out this way, we might have gotten together and mustered up a militia. As to government help...Texas is part of the Confederacy, and the Confederacy has lost too many men to have any left to send out here. Our only help might come from Chief Tall Feather and the Apaches, and maybe some of his Comanche friends. At least we don\u0027t have problems with the Indians out here. They live their lives, we live ours, and we trade. They say an evil spirit has come to earth and possessed the souls of men. I don\u0027t know what it is, only that I\u0027m not running and I will see these killers stopped.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How\u0027d you know about the trouble out here?\" Dave asked suddenly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have family out here-or I did,\" Brendan said, correcting himself. \"And Cody\u0027s folks lived in these parts. His father died out here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody shrugged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My mother went home-back to New Orleans-before I was born. But the important thing is that we\u0027re here to help you fight. Tomorrow, as a matter of fact, if it sits well with you, Sheriff, I\u0027m going to go out and meet that Indian chief. You say his name is Tall Feather?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s right. He\u0027s a good man, even though the Apache are a warrior clan. Tall Feather sees the way the world is going. He says the Spirit Fathers have told him that the white man will not go away, that he will come in greater numbers. If you can\u0027t fight them, in his opinion, you should study them and figure out how to use them. Go ahead and talk to him-he\u0027ll tell you what\u0027s been going on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did you find out at the trading post?\" Cody asked Cole, changing the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole shook his head. \"Two of John Snow\u0027s children have gone missing, both of them beautiful young girls. But I couldn\u0027t find a trail, not a drop of blood, not a broken branch. It\u0027s as if the girls wandered into another dimension.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll try to get out that way, too,\" Cody said. \"So where do Milo and his band hole up during the daylight hours?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one knows,\" Dave said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Brigsby, I\u0027m thinking,\" Cole said. \"But I haven\u0027t had a chance to get back out there to check. We had a gunslinger go through here a few weeks back, and he thought he was tougher than solid stone. He went out to Brigsby. We found what was left of his body on the ground out by where the horses went crazy on Dave and me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We need to get out there as soon as we can manage it,\" Cody said. \"I\u0027d like to be sure what we\u0027re up against. Men like Milo...they can deceive, build traps. We need to find out everything we can if we\u0027re going to fight them. Anyway, Sheriff, what you and your deputy here need to be doing is warning your townsfolk not to open their doors to strangers-and especially not even to be on the streets at night. I tried to tell the girls at the saloon that it was important to be...cautious, but that may have been a lost cause. Thing is-\" Cody broke off, hesitating. The thing was, Cole Granger was going to have to accept some of the truth of the matter-or else the sheriff would be running him out of town before he could count to three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Inviting folks in just leads to danger,\" Cody finished lamely. \"This place needs to be locked up tight at night. We\u0027ll talk more in the morning, if that\u0027s all right with you, Sheriff. I think we\u0027re all worn to the bone right now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good night, then,\" Cole said, and Cody and Brendan started out of the graveyard. \"Hey,\" Cole said, calling them back. \"Where are you staying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Miss Alex is back in town. They\u0027re over at the boardinghouse,\" Dave said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right. Alex is home,\" Cole said thoughtfully. \"Good night, then. And thank you for your help this evening. I offer you a true welcome to Victory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody waved a hand in acknowledgment, wondering at the sheriff\u0027s tone when he\u0027d mentioned Alex\u0027s name. Was something going on there? Long-ago lovers? She had gone back East to marry, so the story went. But now that she was back in town, maybe things would be rekindled out here. Why not? The sheriff seemed like a good man, young, good-looking. And Alexandra Gordon was...beautiful. More than that. She was a fighter. There was a life inside her that was like a shimmering flame, beckoning everyone to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tamped down the thought. He\u0027d decided long ago that his life was meant to be a solitary one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think the boardinghouse is safe?\" Brendan asked as they walked together along the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody shook his head. \"It\u0027s a boardinghouse. Its business is opening its door to strangers.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Someone in there knows something, though. There are crosses all over the place, garlic festooned around the window.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t matter. Milo has already been in there,\" Cody said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe we need more crosses,\" Brendan suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What we need is to kill Milo,\" Cody said, and kept walking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrendan looked after him. \"Right. And then pierce his heart, chop off his head and burn the body to ash.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAS THE TWO OF THEM walked back to the boardinghouse, Cody thought back to how he and Brendan had met. It had started with the murderer Aldridge had needed his help in stopping. He could still remember bending over the first two bodies....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first of the two latest victims was lying on his back, a look of abject terror on his face. His wife was in worse condition. Her tormentor must have played with her first, because her eyes were closed, as if she had clenched them hard against the sight of her impending death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth bodies bore stab marks about the chest and abdomen, but neither was lying in the expected pool of blood, and both were curiously white.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It beats everything I\u0027ve seen,\" Aldridge said quietly, watching as Cody moved the woman\u0027s hair aside to reveal the marks he\u0027d been sure he would find. Cody hesitated, wondering just how much of the truth Aldridge might be able to accept.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe evidence was actually encouraging, at least as far as putting an end to the killing spree went. He was pretty sure he was looking at a rogue killer, someone who was trying to blend in with the population of the city. The stab marks had been made to fool whoever found the bodies, and it was only luck-good for Aldridge, maybe not so good for Cody himself-that someone had connected these killings to the case Cody had put an end to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody looked up at Aldridge. \"I\u0027ll go after your killer, sir, but it\u0027s unlikely I\u0027ll be able to bring him in for trial. This...person will fight to the death.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAldridge stared at him. \"You do what you have to do. I need you to catch this man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t be held to any curfew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll have free rein,\" Aldridge promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night, Cody prowled the streets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe tried the bars first, but found nothing unusual. Then, as he walked along Dauphine Street, he noticed a gate standing ajar. Curious, he pushed the gate open and stepped into a dark courtyard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe scanned the courtyard quickly, then winced, seeing what looked like a pile of clothing off to one side. He hurried over and found the body of a young woman, still warm to the touch, but dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eQuite, quite dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill warm, he thought. Which meant the killer might still be near.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard piano music and a songstress at work coming from one of the nearby restaurants, so he walked over to see what he might find.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood by the bar and sipped bourbon as he looked around the room. Several soldiers were at a table close to the piano, where they watched a dark-haired and quite beautiful woman as she played and sang, all the while flirting openly with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he watched, the songstress rose, whispered in the ear of one of the men, then left him sitting and staring hungrily after her as she walked toward the back and the alley Cody knew ran behind the building.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs subtly as he could, he followed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had to stop the death toll. Now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was waiting, leaning against the wall, a wicked smile upon her face as she waited with supreme anticipation. He stared at her for a moment, realizing with a sick feeling that she wasn\u0027t the intended victim at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me?\" she said, surprised when she saw Cody, and not the young man with whom she\u0027d been flirting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good evening,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled and shivered, though it was far from cold. \"Lovely night, actually. I\u0027m Vivien La Rue. How do you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stretched out a hand, and when he took it, she allowed her fingers to wander over his flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You shouldn\u0027t be out here,\" he said, playing along. \"There\u0027s a killer loose in the city.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe glanced toward the door. The young soldier had yet to emerge, but it might not be much longer until he showed. This would have to happen quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you interested in other sorts of...entertainment?\" he asked softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed and sized him up. \"What might you have in mind? And what are you offering?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe moved closer and slid her arms around his neck, gazing up into his eyes. Something she saw there seemed to startle her, and she started to pull away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t let her. She let out a hissing sound and threw back her head, lips receding, teeth extending. She started to aim for his throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was ready. And he was extremely strong. He slit her throat, instantly severing the jugular. Trying to avoid the spilling blood, he worked relentlessly, sawing, finally dropping both the body and the head to the ground as he made the final cut. In moments, nothing was left but a pile of ash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrateful that the soldier had not yet made an appearance, he hurried out of the alley and straight to Aldridge\u0027s office, where the lieutenant had promised to wait for word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody informed him that the killer had been found and, as he\u0027d predicted, been killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s the body?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m afraid you won\u0027t find it.\" Suddenly, Cody realized Aldridge was looking at someone who was seated behind him, and he cursed himself. He should have sensed the other presence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned quickly to see a lean, dignified man of middle age. Cody recognized him as Brendan Vincent, a one-time brigadier general in the Union army, discharged on medical grounds, who had made his reputation in the Mexican War and was now honored by both sides in the current conflict.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVincent stood as Aldridge made the introductions and smiled grimly as he shook Cody\u0027s hand. \"I\u0027m pleased to meet you, young man. I need you desperately.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve been having some trouble out West. In Texas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStartled, Cody looked at Aldridge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAldridge nodded grimly. \"Yes, Texas, still a Southern state. But murder is murder, and Brendan is my cousin. He\u0027s made Texas his home since his discharge, and...well, I\u0027ll let him explain for himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve had a few...incidents recently. Whole towns disappearing, and I think we\u0027re looking at the same kind of killer my cousin tells me you\u0027ve now defeated twice. I\u0027m desperate, Mr. Fox. I need you to come with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody winced, looking downward for a moment. Did he really want to go back there? Out West? Where he\u0027d been conceived?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right,\" he said after a moment. \"When do we leave?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"First thing in the morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Exactly where are we going?\" he asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to Victory, my boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first he thought Vincent was trying to be poetic. Then it hit him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Victory, Texas,\" he breathed, and the other man nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCody swore under his breath, cursing fate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf there was any place he hated, it was Victory, Texas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE DREAM CAME UPON Alex as if she were watching a play. It was as if velvet curtains opened and stage lighting slowly illuminated the scene, a scene she went from watching to starring in. She was lying in her bed at first, but then she rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe moonlight outside the window was so tempting. Or it might have been the shadows, like wings, like beckoning arms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0027d been warned to keep everything locked, but it was such a beautiful night. The outlaws were long gone, had ridden out of town, and the sound of the breeze against the windows was enticing. She wanted to feel the wind. Feel it lift her hair and caress her cheeks. It would be soft and balmy, as gentle as the moon glow. The breeze would lift the soft cotton of her gown, and she would feel its cool sensation on her flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a few moments she hovered by her bed, but then, almost as if she were floating, she moved toward the French doors that led out to the balcony and pushed them open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there was the moon. Not yet full, but it was a cloudless night, so perhaps that was why the moonlight seemed so strong. From her balcony, she could see virtually the entire town, except she couldn\u0027t really see most of the houses, only the lights here and there where someone was keeping a lantern burning through the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe saw the trees, the branches that had created the beckoning shadows she had been unable to resist. Though the breeze was gentle, the branches bowed and waved as if they were in fact greeting her. She slid her hands over the rail at the balcony\u0027s edge and felt the wood beneath her hands, warm and supportive, as if it were something living. The air moved around her, and she blushed, even though she was alone, at the way she was seduced by the erotic feel of it. The fabric of her gown, like the shadows, seemed to touch her, to stroke her with arousing fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe needed to turn away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo go inside, to lock the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo close away these feelings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even as the thought gained a foothold in her mind, the shadows continued touching her, their touch palpable, sensuous. It was as if they had substance, as if they could take her and whisk her away into the night. The shadows were taking form, as if they were giant birds, or even bats, as if they had talons and could pluck her up from where she stood and fly with her, their prisoner, into the night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInto true darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA scream froze in her throat. The dream had become a nightmare. She reminded herself that she was strong, that she knew how to fight, how to shoot. But she had no weapon, and even if she did, shooting a shadow would be of no avail, and fighting the wind was a futile task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as suddenly as he had appeared that day. The tall man in the railroad duster and the hat dipping low over golden eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood straight and firm against the wind, defying the darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his arms around her and swept her close, and she was uncomfortably aware of the intense way he was looking down at her. His eyes, which in reality were hazel, were glowing with a true golden splendor against the night. It was like being touched by the sun, and heat coursed through her, warming her face, her limbs, and stirring an arousal she\u0027d never experienced before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walked with her into her room and gently set her down on the bed. Then he touched her cheek with a tenderness that made her catch her breath, but when she would have stroked his face and drawn him to her, he rose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Always fight the shadows, and never listen to the wind,\" he whispered. \"And don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ll be here,\" he added, as if it were a vow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the words, though, he stepped away from her and stood at the foot of her bed. \"Never open your door. Believe me as you believe in God, Miss Gordon, and do not open your door,\" he warned her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to speak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to draw him back to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted to forget that her father had been killed, that there had ever been a past and would ever be a future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted him back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she couldn\u0027t form words. It was a dream, of course. A dream turned nightmare, turned dream again. Because she was safe, and she knew it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he was there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sleep now, Miss Gordon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Alex,\" she managed to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sleep, Alex.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so she did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWHEN SHE OPENED her eyes, she was alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet she could remember every detail of the dream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the cold light of day, she groaned aloud, wishing she didn\u0027t remember with quite so much clarity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rose impatiently and turned toward the doors to the balcony. They were closed, the curtains drawn. And it was the light of day seeping in, not moonlight punctuated by dancing shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she noticed the door that connected her room to the one beyond. Once that room had been the nursery, but it had long ago been converted to a guest room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe hesitated, her heart thundering, then set her hand on the doorknob and slowly turned it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door was unlocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pushed it open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bed was unmade, as if awaiting the maid\u0027s attention. And lying on the bench at the foot of the bed were saddlebags. Saddlebags engraved with a name.
