On the Santa Monica pier Trent\u0027s wearing a suit and sitting on a bench at the entrance and when he sees me approaching he looks up from his phone and takes off his sunglasses and just stares at me warily. Trent mentions he finished lunch earlier than he\u0027d planned with a skittish actor he manages, successfully persuading him to take a role in a movie for myriad reasons that would be beneficial to everybody.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m actually surprised you came,\" Trent says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why couldn\u0027t I meet you at the restaurant?\" I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because I don\u0027t really want to be seen with you,\" he says. \"It would validate something that I wouldn\u0027t want validated, I guess.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI start walking with him along the boardwalk. He puts his sunglasses back on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose I\u0027m more sensitive about things than I thought,\" he says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got your client an audition today,\" I say, in a good mood because of how Rain responded to me last night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" Trent says. \"You did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pause. \"Isn\u0027t that what you wanted to see me about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrent thinks about it before saying, \"In a way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe empty Ferris wheel looms over us as we pass by barely visible in the haze, just a dim circle, and except for a few Mexican fishermen no one\u0027s around. Holiday decorations are still up and a dead Christmas tree wrapped in a garland leans against the peeling wall of the arcade and the faint smell of churros floats toward us from a brightly colored cart and it\u0027s hard to concentrate on Trent because the only sounds are the distant surf and the squalling of low-flying gulls, the psychic calling out to us, the calliope playing a Doors song.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t about Blair?\" I suddenly ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrent looks over at me as if he\u0027s shocked I would ask that. \"No. Not at all. This has nothing to do with Blair.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI keep moving with him down the boardwalk toward the end of the pier, waiting for him to say something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I want to make this quick,\" Trent finally says, checking his watch. \"I\u0027ve got to be back in Beverly Hills by three.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug and put my hands in the pockets of the hoodie I\u0027m wearing, one of them forming a fist around my phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess you\u0027re going to stop this with Rain Turner, right?\" Trent asks. \"I mean, the audition\u0027s this afternoon, right? And then it\u0027ll be over?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stop ... what, Trent?\" I ask innocently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever it is you do with these girls.\" He quickly makes a face, then tries to relax. \"This, I don\u0027t know, this little game you play.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about, Trent?\" I ask, sounding as casual and amused as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Promise them things, sleep with them, buy them things and then you can only get them so far and when you can\u0027t get them the things that you really promised ... \" Trent stops walking and takes off his sunglasses and looks at me, mystified. \"Do I really need to say this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s just a very interesting theory.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrent stares at me before he continues walking, and then he stops again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s interesting that you - what? Abandon them? Try to screw things up for them once they figure it all out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething in me snaps. \"I think Meghan Reynolds is doing okay,\" I say. \"I think she benefited from using me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t really need to work, do you?\" Trent asks. He sounds genuinely interested. \"You\u0027ve got family money, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t say anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean, you can\u0027t afford to live like you do just off screenwriting,\" Trent says. \"I mean, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shrug. \"I do okay.\" I shrug again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know Rain Turner doesn\u0027t have a shot at that role.\" Trent keeps walking and then he puts his sunglasses back on as if it\u0027s the only thing that will calm him down. \"I talked to Mark. I talked to Jon. You can keep f**king with her as long as you want, I guess - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trent, you know what? I just realized this is none of your business.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, it has, unfortunately, become my business.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/imperial-bedrooms/page-40.html","bookId":2684,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:48 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:48 AM"}
