Most of the old crowd has gone off in search of greener pastures. We\u0027re getting a lot of smarmy little leather boys lately.\" He frowned at the thought, then remembered that frowning gives you lines and willed his face to return to its normal expression. \"I don\u0027t much adore the crew we\u0027ve been attracting lately. Motorcycle boys, S-and-M types. I don\u0027t really want anyone killed in my bar, you know. Most especially my estimable self.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not do something about it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To be horribly candid, they scare me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI finished my drink. \"There\u0027s an easy way for you to handle it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do tell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go over to the Sixth Precinct and talk to Lieutenant Edward Koehler. Tell him your problem and ask him to raid you a few times.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got to be kidding.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Think about it. Slip Koehler a couple of bucks. Fifty should do it. He\u0027ll arrange to raid you a few times and give your leather crowd a hard time. There won\u0027t be any charges against you, so it won\u0027t screw you up with the SLA. Your liquor license won\u0027t be in jeopardy. The motorcycle boys are like everybody else. They can\u0027t afford hassles. They\u0027ll find some other house to haunt. Of course your business will fall off for a couple of weeks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s off, anyway. The little cunts are all beer drinkers, and they don\u0027t leave tips.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you won\u0027t be losing much. Then in a month or so you\u0027ll start getting the kind of clientele you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What a devious mind you have, Matthew. I think it might work, at that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It should. And don\u0027t give me too much credit. It\u0027s done all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You say fifty dollars should do it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It ought to. It would have when I was on the force, but everything\u0027s been going up lately, even bribery. If Koehler wants more, he\u0027ll let you know about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t doubt it. Well, it\u0027s not as if I never gave money to New York\u0027s Finest. They come around every Friday to collect, and you wouldn\u0027t believe what Christmas cost me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I would.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But I never gave them money in the hope of anything beyond being allowed to remain in business. I didn\u0027t realize you could ask favors in return.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a free-enterprise system.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it seems. I just might try it, and I\u0027ll buy you a drink on the strength of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe poured a generous shot into my glass. I picked it up and eyed him over the top of it. \"There\u0027s something else you could do for me,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ask around a little about Richie Vanderpoel. I know you don\u0027t want to give me any names. That\u0027s reasonable. But see if you can find out what he was like. I\u0027d appreciate it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t expect much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I won\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ran his fingers through his beautiful blond hair. \"Do you really care what he was like, Matt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes,\" I said. \"Evidently I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMAYBE it was a reaction to too many visits to bars that were gay in name alone. I\u0027m not sure, but on my way to the subway I stopped at an outdoor phone booth and looked up a number in my notebook. I dropped in a dime and dialed it, and when she answered I said, \"Elaine? Matt Scudder.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, hi Matt. How\u0027s it going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not too bad. I was wondering if you felt like company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d love to see you. Give me a half hour? I was just getting into the shower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had coffee and a roll and read the Post. The new mayor was having trouble appointing a deputy mayor. His investigative board kept discovering that his prospective appointees were corrupt in any of several uninteresting ways. There was an obvious answer, and he would probably hit on it sooner or later. He was going to have to get rid of the investigative board.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome more citizens had killed each other since yesterday\u0027s edition went to press. Two off-duty patrolmen had had a few drinks in a bar in Woodside and shot each other with their service revolvers. One was dead, the other in critical condition. A man and woman who had served ninety days each for child abuse had sued successfully to regain custody of the child from the foster parents who had had the kid for three and a half years. The nude torso of an adolescent boy had been discovered on a tenement roof on East Fifth Street. Someone had carved an X into the chest, presumably the same person who had removed the arms and legs and head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI left the newspaper on the table and got a cab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lived in a good building on Fifty-first between First and Second. The doorman confirmed that I was expected and nodded me toward the elevator. She was waiting at the door for me, wearing royal-blue hip-huggers and a lime-green blouse. She had gold hoop earrings in her ears and she smelled of a rich, musky perfume.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI draped my coat over an Eames chair while she closed the door and fastened the bolt. She came into my arms for an openmouthed kiss and rubbed her little body against me. \"Mmmm,\" she said. \"That\u0027s nice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re looking good, Elaine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let me look at you. You don\u0027t look so bad yourself, in a rugged, rough-hewn sort of a way. How\u0027ve you been?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Keeping busy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was chamber music stacked on her stereo. The last record was just ending, and I sat on the couch and watched as she walked to the turntable and inverted the stack of records. I wondered whether the hip wiggle was for my benefit or if it came naturally to her. I had always wondered that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI liked the room. White wall-to-wall shag carpet, stark modern furniture more comfortable than it looked, a lot of primary colors and chrome. A couple of abstract oils on the walls. I couldn\u0027t have lived in a room like that, but I enjoyed spending occasional time in it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not just now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat on the couch next to me and talked about books she had read and movies she had seen. She was very good at small talk. I suppose she had to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe kissed a few times, and I touched her breasts and put a hand on her round bottom. She made a purring sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want to come to bed, Matt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bedroom was small, with a more subdued color scheme. She turned on a small stained-glass lamp and killed the overhead light. We got undressed and lay down on the queen-size bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was warm and young and eager, with soft, perfumed skin and a tautly muscled body. Her hands and mouth were clever. But it was not working, and after a few minutes I moved away from her and patted her gently on the shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Relax, honey.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s not going to work,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Something I should be doing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shook my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too much to drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t that. I was far too completely locked into my own head. \"Maybe,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It happens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Or maybe it\u0027s the wrong time of the month for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe laughed. \"Right, you got your period.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Must be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe put our clothes on. I got three tens from my wallet and put them on the dresser. As usual, she pretended not to notice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Want that drink now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh, I guess. Bourbon, if you have it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t. She had Scotch, and I settled for that. She poured herself a glass of milk, and we sat on the couch together and listened to the music without saying anything for a while. I felt as relaxed as if we had made love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Working these days, Matt?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, everybody has to work.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook a cigarette out of her pack, and I lit it for her. \"You got things on your mind,\" she said. \"That\u0027s what\u0027s the matter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re probably right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know I\u0027m right. Want to talk about anything?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe telephone rang, and she answered it in the bedroom. When she came back I asked her if she had ever lived with a man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You mean like a pimp? Never have and never will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I meant like a boyfriend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never. It\u0027s a funny thing about boyfriends in this business. They always turn out to be pimps.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. I\u0027ve known so many girls. \u0027Oh, he\u0027s not a pimp, he\u0027s my boyfriend.\u0027 But it always turns out that he\u0027s between jobs, and that he makes a life\u0027s work out of being between jobs, and she pays for everything. But he\u0027s not a pimp, just a boyfriend. They\u0027re very good at kidding themselves, those girls. I\u0027m lousy at kidding myself. So I don\u0027t even try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t afford boyfriends. Busy saving for my old age.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Real estate, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh. Apartment houses in Queens. You can keep the stock market. I want something I can reach out and touch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re a landlady. That\u0027s funny.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I never see tenants or anything. There\u0027s a company manages it for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered if it was Bowdoin Management but didn\u0027t bother asking. She asked if I wanted to try the bedroom again. I said I didn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not to rush you, but I\u0027m expecting a friend in about forty minutes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have another drink if you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s time I was on my way.\" She walked me to the door and held my coat for me. I kissed her goodbye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t be so long between visits next time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take care, Elaine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 10\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFriday morning came clear and crisp. I picked up an Olin rental car on Broadway and took the East Side Drive out of town. The car was a Chevrolet Malibu, a skittish little thing that had to be pampered on curves. I suppose it was economical to run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI caught the New England Expressway up through Pelham and Larchmont and into Mamaroneck. At an Exxon station the kid who topped up the tank didn\u0027t know where Schuyler Boulevard was. He went inside and asked the boss, who came out and gave me directions. The boss also knew the Carioca, and I had the Malibu parked in the restaurant\u0027s lot at twenty-five minutes of twelve. I went into the cocktail lounge and sat on a vinyl stool at the front end of a black Formica bar. I ordered a cup of black coffee with a shot of bourbon in it. The coffee was bitter, left over from the night before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cup was still half full when I looked over and saw her standing hesitantly in the archway between the dining room and the cocktail lounge. If I hadn\u0027t known she was Wendy Hanniford\u0027s age, I would have guessed high by three or four years. Dark, shoulder-length hair framed an oval face. She wore dark plaid slacks and a pearl-gray sweater beneath which her large breasts were aggressively prominent. She had a large brown leather handbag over her shoulder and a cigarette in her right hand. She did not look happy to see me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let her come to me, and after a moment\u0027s hesitation she did. I turned slowly to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Scudder?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs. Thal? Should we take a table?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I suppose so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dining room was uncrowded, and the head waitress showed us to a table in back and out of the way. It was an overdecorated room, a room that tried too hard, done in someone\u0027s idea of a flamenco motif. The color scheme involved a lot of red and black and ice blue. I had left my bitter coffee at the bar and now ordered bourbon with water back. I asked Marcia Thal if she wanted a drink. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sins-of-the-fathers-matthew-scudder-1/page-12.html","bookId":2319,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:56 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:56 PM"}
