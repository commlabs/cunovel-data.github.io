How can this be? How has he managed to blind us to his whereabouts? I tell you, he hovers over all of this, as unknowable as his sister. This wretched family from that wretched empire —’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA cane cracked against bones, splintering them, and Silchas turned to see that a new god had arrived. Indistinct, a smear of shadow. ‘ Dessembrae ,’ this one hissed, ‘ and dearest Jhess. Beru, Shedenul, Mowri. Beckra, Thilanda, see how you crowd this Tiste Andii? This brother of Anomander Rake? Do you imagine he cannot hear you? ’ The cane jabbed at Dessembrae. ‘ Look at us, so fey in reflection of our once-mortal selves. The Empire, yes! Our empire, Dessembrae, or have you forgotten? That wretched family? Our very own children! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Oh, look around, Shadowthrone ,’ snarled Jhess, her face of skeined wool, cotton, hemp and silk twisting and knotting as she bared web-shrouded teeth. ‘ D’rek has come and gone from this place. She knows and makes for us a true path. Your damned children cannot hope to defeat us. Leave them to the Forkrul Assail! May they devour each other! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShadowthrone giggled. ‘ Tell me, Jhess, do you see your cousin anywhere near? Where is the Queen of Dreams in this place of death? ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ She hides —’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ She is not here, Jhess ,’ said Shadowthrone, ‘ because she is awake. Awake! Do you understand me? Not sleeping, not dreaming herself here, not plucking all your mad tails, Jhess, to confuse mortal minds. You are all blind fools! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ You mean to betray us! ’ shrieked Shedenul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ I care nothing for any of you ,’ Shadowthrone replied, with a laconic gesture of one ethereal hand. ‘ Betray? Too much effort over too little of worth .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ You come here only to mock us? ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ I am here, Beru, because I am curious. Not about any of you. You’re nothing but gods, and if the Assail succeed you will all vanish like farts in the wind. No, my curiosity is with our unexpected guest, our Tiste Andii .’ The cane waved at Silchas Ruin. ‘ O brother of heroes, why do you bless Coltaine’s Eternal Fall with your presence? ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘I seek a weapon.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ The two you carry are not enough? ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘For a companion. This battle you all seem so eager to join, I could warn you against it, but I admit that I see little use in that. You are all determined to join the fray, leaving me to wonder.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Wonder what? ’ demanded Beru.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘When the dust settles, how many of your corpses will I see upon that field?’ Silchas Ruin shrugged. ‘Do as you will.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Your brother slew our strongest ally .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘He did? And of what significance is that to me, Beru?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ You are as infuriating as he was! May you share his fate! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘We shall all share his fate,’ Silchas Ruin replied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShadowthrone giggled. ‘ I have found you a weapon, but only if the one who wields it is worthy .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilchas Ruin looked round. ‘From this place?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ No, not from here. There is nothing to the weapons here but memories of failure .’ A sword appeared from the shadows swirling round the god and clattered at the Tiste Andii’s feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking down, he drew a sharp breath. ‘Where did you come by this?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Recognize it? ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘A Hust … but no.’ He hesitated. ‘I feel that I should, knowing well that sacred forge. The draconic theme is … distinctive. But the ferrules remind me of Hust’s earliest period of manufacture, and I thought I knew all of those so made. Where did you come by this?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Of little relevance, Prince. You note the draconic theme, do you? What is the term? Pattern weld? So you might think, to see those scales glittering so prettily along the length of the blade .’ He giggled. ‘ So you might think .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘This weapon is too good for the one I intended to arm.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Indeed? How … unfortunate. Perhaps you could convince your friend to take the ones you now wield? And for yourself, this singular weapon. Consider it a gift to you, from Shadowthrone .’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘And why should you so gift me?’ Silchas Ruin asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘ Perhaps the others here bemoan the loss of Hood. I do not. He was hoary and humourless, and ugly besides. Thus. If I cannot convey my best wishes to Hood’s noble slayer, then his brother shall have to do .’ \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-113.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
