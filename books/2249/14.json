Things had been quiet since Block had pounded him into the sidewalk, and that gave him thinking time. Of course, one of his thoughts had been Giles Dent killing a dozen people in a fiery blaze, and that one wasn\u0027t sitting well with anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were in the process of reading the second journal now. Though there\u0027d been no stunning revelations so far, he kept his own notes. He knew it wasn\u0027t always what a person said, or wrote, but what they were thinking when they said or wrote it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was telling to him that while she wrote about the kindness of her cousin, the movements in her womb, even the weather, the daily chores, Ann Hawkins wrote nothing of Giles or the night at the Pagan Stone for weeks after the events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo he spent some time turning over in his mind what she hadn\u0027t written.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat with his feet on Cal\u0027s coffee table, a Coke in his hand, and chips within easy reach. The basketball game was on TV, but he couldn\u0027t concentrate on it. He had a big day tomorrow, he mused, and a lot on his mind. The trip to the doctor\u0027s office would be pretty quick, all in all. There wasn\u0027t that much for him to do, really. And it wasn\u0027t anything he hadn\u0027t done before. A man of thirty knew how to-ha-handle the job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was prepared for court. The docket gave them two days, but he thought they\u0027d wrap it up in one. After that, they\u0027d all meet. They\u0027d read, they\u0027d discuss. And they\u0027d wait.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat he should do was go home, get out Cybil\u0027s notes, his own, Quinn\u0027s transcriptions. He should take a harder, closer look at Layla\u0027s charts and graphs. Somewhere in there was another piece of the whole. It needed to be shaken out and studied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead he sat where he was, took another swallow of Coke. And said what was on his mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going into the doctor\u0027s tomorrow with Sage and Paula to donate sperm so they can have a kid.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a very long stretch of silence into which Cal finally said, \"Huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sage asked me, and I thought about it, and I figured sure, why not? They\u0027re good together, Sage and Paula. It\u0027s just strange to know that I\u0027m going to try to get somebody pregnant tomorrow, by remote.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re giving your sister a shot at a family,\" Cal pointed out. \"Not so strange.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust that one remark made Fox feel considerably better. \"I\u0027m going to bunk here tonight. If I go home, I\u0027m going to be tempted to go by and see Layla. If I see Layla, I\u0027m going to want to get her naked.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you want to go in tomorrow fully loaded,\" Gage concluded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Stupid and superstitious probably, but yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got the couch,\" Cal told him. \"Especially since I know you won\u0027t be jacking off on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, Fox thought, there were times a man just needed to be around other guys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTHE LATE MARCH SNOWSTORM WAS ANNOYING. IT would\u0027ve been less so if he\u0027d bothered to listen to the weather before leaving the house that morning. Then he\u0027d have had his winter coat, since winter decided to make the return trip. A thin, chilly white coated the early yellow haze of forsythia. Wouldn\u0027t hurt them, Fox thought as he drove back toward the Hollow. Those heralding spring bloomers were hardy, and used to the caprices, even the downright nastiness, of nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was sick of winter. Even though spring was the gateway to summer, and this summer the portal to the Seven, he wished the door would hit winter in the ass on its way out. The problem was there\u0027d been a couple of nice days before this season-straddling storm blew in. Nature held those warm, sunny days like a bright carrot on a frozen stick, teasing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe snow would melt, he reminded himself. It was better to remember he\u0027d had a pretty good day. He\u0027d done his duty by his sister, and by his client. Now he was going home, getting out of the suit, having a nice cold beer. He was going to see Layla. And after tonight\u0027s session, he would do his best to talk himself into her bed, or talk her into his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs he turned onto Main, Fox spotted Jim Hawkins outside the gift shop. He stood, hands on his hips, studying the building. Fox pulled over to the curb, hit the button to lower the window. \"Hey!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJim turned. He was a tall man with thoughtful eyes, a steady hand. He walked to the truck, leaned on the open window. \"How you doing, Fox?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doing good. It\u0027s cold out there. Do you want a ride?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, just taking a walk around.\" He looked back toward the shop. \"I\u0027m sorry Lorrie and John are closing down, leaving town.\" When he looked back at Fox, his eyes were somber, and another layer of worry weighed in his voice. \"I\u0027m sorry the town has to lose anyone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know. They took a hard hit.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I heard you did, too. I heard what happened with Block.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m all right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"At times like this, when I see the signs. All the signs, Fox, I wish there was more I could do than call your father and have him fix broken windows.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re going to do more than get through this time, Mr. Hawkins. We\u0027re going to stop it this time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cal believes that, too. I\u0027m trying to believe it. Well.\" He let out a sigh. \"I\u0027ll be calling your father shortly, have him take a look at this place. He\u0027ll fix it up, spruce it here and there. And I\u0027ll look for somebody who wants to start a business on Main Street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFox frowned at the building. \"I might have an idea on that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have to think about it, see if... See. Maybe you could let me know before you start looking, or before you decide on a new tenant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m happy to do that. The Hollow needs ideas. It needs businesses on Main Street.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And people who care enough to fix what\u0027s broken,\" Fox said, thinking of Layla\u0027s words. \"I\u0027ll get back to you on it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFox drove on. He had something new to turn over in his mind now, something interesting. And something, for him, that symbolized hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe parked in front of his office, stepped out into the cold, wet snow, and noticed his office lights glinting against the windows. When he walked in, Layla glanced up from her keyboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I told you that you didn\u0027t have to come in today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had busywork.\" She stopped typing to swivel toward him. \"I rearranged the storage closet so it works better for me. And the kitchen, and some of the files. Then... Is it still snowing?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" He shrugged out of his light jacket. \"It\u0027s after five, Layla.\" And he didn\u0027t like the idea of her being alone in the building for hours at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got caught up. We\u0027ve been so focused on the journal entries, we\u0027ve let some of the other areas go. Cybil\u0027s hunted up all the newspaper reports on anything related to the Seven, the anecdotal evidence, specifics we\u0027ve gleaned from you guys, coordinating passages from some of the books on the Hollow. I\u0027ve been putting them together in various files. Chronologically, geographically, type of incident, and so on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Twenty years of that. It\u0027ll take a while.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do better when I have a system, have order. Plus, we all know that considering the amount of time, the amount of damage, the actual reports are scarce.\" She brushed back her hair, cocked her head. \"How did it go in court?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should I ask how things went before court?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did my part. They said I could just, ah, pass off the... second round to Sage for transport in the morning. Then I guess we wait and see if any soldier makes a landing.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t have to wait long these days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrugged, slipped his hands into his pockets. \"I didn\u0027t think of you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean, you know, when I... donated. I didn\u0027t think of you because it seemed rude.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLayla\u0027s lips twitched. \"I see. Who did you think of?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They provide visual stimulation in the form of skin mags. I didn\u0027t actually catch her name.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Men.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m thinking of you now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer brows lifted when he walked back, locked the door. \"Are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m thinking I need you to come back to my office.\" He came over, took her hand. \"And put in a little overtime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why, Mr. O\u0027Dell. If only I\u0027d put my hair in a bun and worn glasses.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe grinned as he drew her across the room, down the hall. \"If only. But...\" He let go of her hands to unbutton her crisp white shirt. \"Let\u0027s see what\u0027s under here today.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I thought you wanted me to take a letter.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To whom it may concern, frilly white bras with-oh yeah-front hooks are now standard office attire.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think this one will fit you,\" she said, then surprised him by tugging on his tie. \"Let\u0027s see what\u0027s under here. I\u0027ve thought about you, Mr. O\u0027Dell.\" She slid the tie off, tossed it aside. \"About your hands, your mouth, about how many ways you used them on me.\" She unhooked his belt as she backed him into his office. \"About how many ways you might use them on me again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike the tie, she whipped off the belt, let it fall. She shoved his suit jacket off his shoulders, tugged it away. \"Start now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re pretty bossy for a secretary.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Office manager.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Either way.\" He bit her bottom lip. \"I like it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then you\u0027re going to love this.\" She pushed him down into his desk chair, pointed a finger to keep him in place. Then with her eyes on his, wiggled out of her panties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Boy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter tossing them aside, she straddled him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d been thinking couch, maybe the floor, but at the moment, with her mouth like a fever on his, the chair seemed perfect. He yanked at her shirt, closed his mouth over her lace-covered breast. This wasn\u0027t a woman looking for slow seduction, but for fire and speed. So he used his hands, his mouth, and let her set the pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"As soon as you walked in, I wanted this.\" She fumbled between them, dragged down the zipper of his trousers. \"As soon as you walked in, Fox.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe closed around him the moment he was inside her. Tightened as her head fell back, as she gasped. Then her lips were on his throat, on his face, were clashing against his in desperation as her hips pumped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took him over with her urgency, her sudden, fierce greed. He let himself be taken, be ruled. Unable to resist, he let himself be filled, and let himself empty. When he came, when his mind was still dazzled by his body\u0027s race, she caught his face in her hands and rode him ruthlessly to her own end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continued to sit, bemused, after they\u0027d gotten their breath back, even after she rose and started to step back into her panties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait. I think those are mine now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she laughed, he solved the matter by getting up and snatching them out of her hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Give me those. I can\u0027t walk around without-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and I will be the only ones who know. It\u0027s already driving me crazy. I need to go up, change out of this suit. Come on up, then I\u0027ll drive you home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll wait here, because if I go up there, you\u0027ll get me into bed. Fox, I need those panties. They match the bra.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe only smiled as he strolled out. He intended to get the bra later. And was considering having them preserved in Lucite, along with his desk chair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eALL GOOD THINGS MUST COME TO AN END, FOX thought, as they spent the next few hours picking through the second journal, turning Ann\u0027s ordinary words to every possible angle looking for hidden meanings. Once again, Gage\u0027s demand to skip the hell ahead was outvoted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Same reasons against apply,\" Cybil pointed out, taking advantage of the break to roll tension out of her neck and shoulders. \"We have to consider the fact that she\u0027s lost the man she loved, a traumatic event. That she\u0027s about to give birth to triplets. And if that isn\u0027t a traumatic event I don\u0027t know what would be. This is her lull. She needs to steady herself and gear up at the same time. I think we have to respect that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it\u0027s more.\" Layla reached out to touch the book Quinn had set down. \"I think she\u0027s writing about sewing, about cooking, about the heat because she needs some distance. She doesn\u0027t write about Giles, about the deaths, what was done. She doesn\u0027t write about what she thinks or fears about what\u0027s going to happen. It\u0027s all the moment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at Fox, and he nodded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve been leaning that way. It\u0027s what she\u0027s not writing about. Every day she gets through is an effort. She fills them with routines. But I can\u0027t believe that she\u0027s not thinking about before and after. Not feeling all of that. It\u0027s not a lull so much as... She wanted us to find the journals, even this one that seems to be so full of daily debris. To me it says-she\u0027s saying-that after great loss, personal sacrifice, horror, put a name on it. After that, before and after a new beginning, the births, there\u0027s still life. That it\u0027s still important to live, to go about your business. Isn\u0027t that what we do, seven years at a time? We live, and that\u0027s important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what the hell does that tell us?\" Gage demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That part of the process is just living. That\u0027s giving Twisse the finger, every day. Does it know? In whatever hellhole Dent took it to, does it know? I think it does, and I think it burns its ass that we get up every morning and do what we do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like it.\" Quinn tapped a finger on her lips. \"Maybe it even sucks on its power. It thrives on violent emotions, violent acts. When it\u0027s able, it feeds on them, creates them and feeds. Wouldn\u0027t the opposite be true? That ordinary emotions and acts, or loving ones starve it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweetheart dance.\" Layla straightened in her chair. \"Ordinary, fun, happy. It came there to ruin that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And before, in the dining room of the hotel. Sure it wanted to scare us off,\" Quinn said to Layla. \"But its choice of time and place may be a factor. There was a couple celebrating, flirting over candlelight and wine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you do when a bee stings you?\" Cybil asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You swat at it. Maybe we\u0027re giving him a few stings. We\u0027ll take a closer look at the known incidents, known sightings. And this idea rolls into another for me. Writing something down gives it power, especially names. It\u0027s possible she wanted to wait, or needed to wait until some time had passed. Until she felt more secure.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We wrote down the words,\" Cal murmured. \"We wrote down the words we said that night at the stone, for the blood brothers ritual.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adding to their power,\" Quinn agreed. \"Writing, it\u0027s another answer. We\u0027re writing everything down. While that may be giving him more power-bringing him earlier- it\u0027s giving him more stings.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When we know what we have to do, when we think we know what it\u0027s going to take,\" Fox continued, \"we have to write it down. Like Ann did, like we did that night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Signed in blood at the dark of the moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmused, Cybil glanced over at Gage. \"I wouldn\u0027t discount that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGage rose to go to the kitchen. He wanted more coffee. He wanted, more than the coffee, a few minutes without the chatter. At this point, and as far as he could see for the next several points, it was all talk, no action. He was a patient man, had to be, but he was starting to itch for action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Cybil came in he ignored her. It took some doing. She wasn\u0027t a woman fashioned to be ignored, but he\u0027d been working on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Being irritable and negative doesn\u0027t add much.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe leaned back against the counter with his coffee. \"That\u0027s why I left.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter a moment\u0027s consideration, she opted for wine over tea. \"You\u0027re a little bored, too. But your way hasn\u0027t finished the job. New days, new ways.\" She mirrored his pose, leaning against the other counter with her wine. \"It\u0027s harder for people like you and me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You and me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re plagued with glimpses of what might come, and sometimes does. How do we know what to do, or if we should do anything, to stop it, or change it? If we do, will it be worse?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything\u0027s a risk. That doesn\u0027t worry me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Annoys you though.\" She sipped. \"You\u0027re annoyed right now because of the way things are shaping up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are things shaping up?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our little group\u0027s paired off. Q and Cal, Layla and Fox.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat leaves you and me, big guy. So you\u0027re annoyed, and I can\u0027t blame you. Just FYI, I\u0027m no happier than you are with the idea that some hand of fate might be moving you and me together like chess pieces.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chess is Fox\u0027s game.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe drew in a breath. \"Dealing us into the same hand then.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis brows rose in acknowledgment. \"That\u0027s why there\u0027s a discard pile. No offense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"None taken.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re just not my type.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she smiled, just that way, a man heard siren songs. \"Believe me, if I aimed at you, you wouldn\u0027t have any other type. But that\u0027s neither here nor there. I came in to propose a kind of alliance, a bargain, a deal. However it suits you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s the deal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That you and I will work together, we\u0027ll fight together if it comes to it. We\u0027ll join our particular talents when and if necessary. And I won\u0027t seduce you or pretend to let you seduce me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You wouldn\u0027t be pretending.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There, we\u0027ve each gotten a shot in. Score\u0027s even. You\u0027re here because you love your friends, however else you feel about this place, about some of the people in it, you love your friends and are absolutely loyal to them. I respect that, Gage, and I understand it. I love my friends, and I\u0027m loyal to them. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlancing toward the doorway, she took a slow sip of wine. \"This town isn\u0027t mine, but those people in the other room are. I\u0027ll do whatever I need to do for them. So will you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, do we have a deal?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed away from the counter, crossed to her. He stood close, his eyes on hers. She smelled, he thought, of mysteries that were exclusively female. \"Tell me something. Do you believe we\u0027re going to come out on the other side of this, throwing the confetti and popping the champagne?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They do. That\u0027s almost enough for me. The rest is possibility.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I like probabilities better. But...\" He held out a hand, taking hers when she offered it. \"Deal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good. Then-\" She started to step away, but he held her hand firm in his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if I\u0027d said no?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then, I suppose I\u0027d have been forced to seduce you and make you my love puppy to keep you in line.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grin spread, full of appreciation. \"Love puppy my ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d be surprised. Or would if we didn\u0027t have a deal.\" She put down her wine to pat his hand before pulling hers free. Picking up her wine again, she started to walk out, then stopped, turned back. The amusement was gone. \"He\u0027s in love with her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFox, Gage realized. Cal was already a given. \"Yeah, I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know if he does, certainly Layla doesn\u0027t. Yet. It makes them stronger, and it makes it all more difficult for them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fox especially. That\u0027s his story,\" Gage said, with finality, when her eyes asked how.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"All right. They\u0027re going to need more of us soon, more from us. You\u0027re not going to have the luxury of being bored much longer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you see something?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dreamed they were all dead, piled like offerings on the Pagan Stone. And my hands were red with their blood. Fire crawled up the stone, over the stone, and consumed them while I watched. While I did nothing. When it came out of the dark, it smiled at me. It called me daughter, and it embraced me. Then you leaped out of the shadows and killed us both.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a nightmare, not a vision.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope to God you\u0027re right. Either way, it tells me you and I have to start to work together soon. I won\u0027t have their blood on my hands.\" Her fingers tightened on the stem of her glass. \"Whatever has to be done, I won\u0027t have that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she left, he stayed, and he wondered how much she would be willing to do to save the people they both loved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNO TRACE OF SNOW REMAINED WHEN FOX LEFT his office in the morning. The sun beamed out of a rich blue sky that seemed to laugh at the mere idea of winter. On the trees the leaves of summer were in tight buds of anticipation. Pansies rioted in the tub in front of the flower shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe peeled off his coat-really had to start listening to the weather-and strolled as others did along the wide bricked sidewalks. He smelled spring, the freshness of it, felt it in the balm of the air on his face. It was too nice a day to huddle inside an office. It was a day for the park, or porch sitting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should take Layla to the park, hold her hand and stroll over the bridge, talk her into letting him push her on one of the swings. Push her high, hear her laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe should buy her flowers. Something simple and springlike. The idea had him backtracking, checking traffic, then dashing across the street. Daffodils, he thought as he pulled open the door of the shop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Fox.\" Amy sent him a cheery wave as she came in from the back. She\u0027d run the Flower Pot for years, and to Fox\u0027s mind never tired of flowers. \"Terrific day, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And then some. That\u0027s what I\u0027m after.\" He gestured to the daffodils, bright as butter in the glass refrigerated display.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pretty as a picture.\" She turned, and in the glass, the dim reflection of her face grinned back at his with sharply pointed teeth in a face that ran with blood. Even as he took a step back, she turned around, smiling her familiar and pretty smile. \"Who doesn\u0027t love daffodils?\" she said cheerfully as she wrapped them. \"Are they for your girl?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\" I\u0027m jumpy, he realized. Just jumpy. Too much in my head. As he got out his wallet to pay, he caught a scent under the sweet fragrance of blooms. A swampy odor, as if some of the flowers had rotted in water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Here you go! She\u0027s going to love them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks, Amy.\" He paid, took the flowers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"See you later. Tell Carly I said hi.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped dead, spun around. \"What? What did you say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I said tell Layla I said hi.\" Her eyes shone with puzzled concern. \"Are you all right, Fox?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah. Yeah.\" He pushed through the door, grateful to be back outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs traffic was light, he walked across the street in the middle of the block. The light changed as a cloud rolled over the sun, and he felt a prickle of cold against his skin- the breath of winter out of a springtime sky. His hand tightened on the stems of the flowers as he whirled around, expected to see it, in whatever form it chose to take. But there was nothing, no boy, no dog, no man or dark shadow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he heard her call his name. This time the cold washed over him, into him, through his bones, at the fear in her voice. She called out again as he ran, as he followed her terror to the old library. He rushed through the open door that slammed like death behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere there should have been empty space, some tables, folding chairs for what was now the community center, the room was as it had been years before. Books in stacks, the scent of them, the desks, the carts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ordered himself to steady. It wasn\u0027t real. It was making him see what was not. But she screamed, and Fox ran for the steps, taking them two and three at a time. He ran on legs that trembled, that remembered running this way before. Up the stairs, up past the attic, to heave himself against the door leading out to the roof. When his body hurtled through, the early spring day had died into a hot summer night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweat ran down his skin like water, and fear twisted tearing claws in his belly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood on the ledge of the turret above his head. Even in the dark he could see the blood on her hands, on the stone that had torn at them when she climbed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarly. Her name pounded in his head. Carly, don\u0027t. Don\u0027t move. I\u0027m coming up to get you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it was Layla who looked down at him. Layla\u0027s tears spilling onto pale cheeks. It was Layla who said his name once, desperately. Layla who looked into his eyes and said, \"Help me. Please help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Layla who dived off the ledge to die on the street below. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hollow-sign-of-seven-2/page-14.html","bookId":2249,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:09:24 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:09:24 PM"}
