I’ll hold her back – just don’t fuck up up there, Ges! Throw the hag off the edge. Get that damned heart! ’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler’s legs ached with every step – he was too tired for this. A whole day of fighting. The strain of command. The seemingly endless slaughter. By the time he reached the top – assuming they even got past Sinn – he’d have nothing left. Weaponless, face to face with a damned Forkrul Assail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSinn had not looked back down, not once. She had no idea she was being pursued. Her steps were measured, relentless but slow, almost casual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey had all climbed above the flames, which had at last begun dying below them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl would hold it back now – saving it for the Forkrul Assail. Telas to wage war against the Assail’s warren. Old old shit, all of this. Can’t they all just go away? Back into their forgotten graves. It’s not right, us having to fight in wars we didn’t even start – wars that have been going on for so long they don’t mean a thing any more .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou took a foreign god’s wounded heart. I see the blood on your lips. It’s not right. It just isn’t .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdjunct. I know you ain’t dead. Well, no, I don’t. But I refuse to believe you failed. I don’t think there’s a thing in this world that can stop you. We’ll do our part. You’ll know that much – you’ll know it .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMake this right. Make it all right .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStormy was one step up from Gesler. He saw his friend reaching out, saw his hand close about Sinn’s ankle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, visibly snarling, Stormy tore her from the stairs, swung her out into the air behind him, and let go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler saw her plummet – saw her mouth open wide in shock, and then that visage darkened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow you got her mad, Stormy .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he was reaching now for Gesler, grasping his arm and lifting him past. ‘Go, Gesler! Climb your sorry arse off!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA push that almost sent Gesler sprawling against the steps, but he recovered, and pulled himself upward, leaving Stormy in his wake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon’t look down – don’t look at him, Gesler. You know why – don’t — Instead he paused, twisted round, met his friend’s eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir gazes locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then Stormy nodded, and flashed a half-mad smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGesler made a rude gesture, and then, before his heart could shatter, he turned back to the stone steps and resumed his ascent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHood pulled himself over a splintered ridge of ice and looked up once more. Not far now. The ice road was groaning, cracks spreading like lightning. He had felt the assault of Olar Ethil – her hatred of Omtose Phellack unleashing power that raked through him sharp as talons – and then it had vanished, and he knew that she was dead. But the damage had been done. There was the very real chance that he would not make it, that this spar of ice would shatter beneath him, sending him down to his death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeath. Now, that was an interesting notion. One that, perhaps, he should have been more familiar with than any other being, but the truth was, he knew nothing about it at all. The Jaghut went to war against death. So many met that notion with disbelief, or confusion. They could not understand. Who is the enemy? The enemy is surrender . Where is the battlefield? In the heart of despair . How is victory won? It lies within reach. All you need do is choose to recognize it. Failing that, you can always cheat. Which is what I did .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow did I defeat death?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy taking its throne .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now the blood of a dying god had gifted him with mortal flesh – with a return to mortality. Unexpected. Possibly unwelcome. Potentially … fatal. But then, who has a choice in these matters?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAh, yes, I did .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA rumble of laughter from deep in his chest followed the thought. He resumed his climb.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAhead was a broad fissure cutting diagonally across his path. He would have to jump it. Dangerous and undignified. His moment of humour fell away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could sense the nearby unleashing of Telas – could see how the air around the Spire was grey with smoke, and the stench of burnt flesh swept over him on an errant gust of wind from inland. This is not by the hand of an Imass. This is something … new. Foul with madness .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis could defeat us all .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe reached the fissure, threw himself over its span. His chest struck the edge, the impact almost winding him, and he clawed handholds in the rotted ice beyond. And then waited for a moment, recovering, before dragging himself from the crevasse. As he cleared it a solid shape flashed past on his left, landed with a crunch, claws digging into the crusted snow – a dog . \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-403.html","bookId":2012,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:17:17 PM"}
