You have no right to it. You let her down once already.” I know that pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe walks away with Stuart. When I can\u0027t see them anymore, I pull the phone from my pocket. The live stream is a bit blurry but I can see her. She’s doing homework. Something about her look makes me smile. It’s something I haven’t seen before. She’s curious or daydreaming. I would die to know what it is about. Instead, I send a text.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Sledgehammer and a clean up crew.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Already ordered.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf anyone knows the pain of being left behind and forgotten, it’s Stuart. He would die, if he too, had a tomb somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t know if I have waited long for Stuart or not. She’s there in my mind and in front of me on the screen. She is everything, and somehow, she fills the void where the white noise and fuzz take away my feelings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith her I feel a thousand things. Most of them are bad but it’s better than needing the pain to make me human again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sledgehammer drops on the ground next to me. I glance up at him, “They okay?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shakes his head, “No. They called that cop from the truck. They were sobbing and freaking out but he got them calmed down. He told them everything you said. They called Dr. Bradley after. She explained that she’s basically living in a box and doesn’t know it. She’s under constant surveillance and safe, and that they need to keep their distance so she doesn’t have all those bad things rush in all at once.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pass him the phone and pick up the hammer. I pull off my jacket and roll up my sleeves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t wreck any of the other tombs and headstones.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at the others and nod, “I’ll try not to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Five\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoston - August 2012\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The hallway has cameras and I’ve linked them to the laptop.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at him expectantly, “What about the room? I can’t see her in the room. I\u0027ve spent two years watching her room, I want that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStuart points at me, “Don’t start this shit again. Dr. Bradley says no. You need to deal with your shit as much as she needs to deal with hers. This is an invasion of privacy already.” He sees my jaw clench and leans in, “We aren’t having this conversation again. She and that hot-ass friend of hers, arrive in a couple hours. Let’s go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s in the air flying. It makes me uncomfortable but Jane forbade me to fly with her. She forbade me to watch her constantly. She used words that I don’t give a fuck about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePossession, obsession, control, self-destruction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do I care about those things, when I have the cure so close to me? She is better than any pain, any pleasure, anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI close the door, following Stuart down the long corridor. A man in a janitor uniform passes by us. I see Stuart freeze up. He has some of the lonely, like she does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe swerves a bit, brushing against the wall. I walk faster, looping my arm into his. We don’t speak about it. He only needs a minute. He doesn’t handle janitors. We never discuss it. We don’t need to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don\u0027t like elevators, small spaces, or guns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe don’t talk about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drive us to the gym so we can forget about the things we can\u0027t change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn hour later, both of us are covered in sweat and fully exhausted when he nods at me, “I have to go get her.” He laughs when he sees my face, “You need one more round, bro. You ain’t got all the piss and vinegar out yet. I’ll message you when she lands.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI twitch with the want to be there when she lands. She needs me. She’s going to be scared and confused, and the lonely is going to come and take her away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel the white noise and I turn to Angelo, pointing with my glove. He gives me a fierce smile. We enter the ring and knock gloves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI leave the gym two hours later, fresh, clean, and ready to see her in the flesh. I want her in Boston, where everything’s new and different. I want to go to her; instead, I drive to Jane’s office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI press the elevator and wait. I hate waiting. I hate Jane. I hate what I gave her and the satisfaction that crosses her lips when she sees me thinking about it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI step inside of the elevator and close my eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate elevators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey make me nervous. All small places where the walls creep in and try to touch you. Flashes of drawings and triangles, and the dead eyes in the corner, fill my mind. Sweat bursts from my skin. I can’t wait one more second when the doors open and I fight the urge to leap from the metal box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe is in her chair, tapping her fingers against the wood. She smiles seeing my face, “Eli.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI scowl, “Jane.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gives me a look, “I’ve asked you to call me Dr. Bradley in the office, please.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, “You also asked me to handcuff you to a bed and fuck you senseless so I don’t give a shit, Jane.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer face twitches but remains the same milky tone. She doesn’t blush. I’m convinced she doesn’t feel. “Sit, we need to talk for a minute.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remove my jacket and lay it on the back of the chair I sit on. She looks me over, “You look tired. Are you sleeping?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Pass.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe narrows her eyes, “You have to let me know how you are doing, if you want to be part of this, Eli.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI match her glare, “Well, Jane, I am doing well. How are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scoffs, “Patronize me all you like, but I am the key holder in this little game. The place I’ve got her now is serene and beautiful. You need to back off and give her space.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, “No. It has been a very long time and her family and I want answers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crosses her arms, “You want answers? She is fucking insane—how’s that? Is that clinical enough for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t respond.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighs, “She is literally seconds away from a full-scale meltdown at all times. She is completely weak and lost. The only thing that holds that kid together is that dimwit friend that she calls Shell. I think if she were to lose her, that would be the end. I am praying she meets a guy on campus and gives it the old college try. That is about the only thing that will save her. Love and companionship in the form she calls normal. She is obsessed with normal.” She starts to laugh, “You, my friend, are about the last man on earth, she would be prevailed upon to date. She wants nothing like she wants normal. Not some scarred freak show with hate and callous bitterness all over his face. If she sees that room of yours, she will never understand you. Not ever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI give her a minute to fully grasp everything she has just said, “Are you done?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe takes a breath and nods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stand, “I don\u0027t see her like that. You need to get it through your head, my not wanting you is not because of her. It was lovely seeing you, as always. I will update you on anything I discover.” I pull on my jacket and grin, “I realize you want me and that makes this difficult, but I gave you what you wanted. I never want to speak of it again. It makes me feel sad for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer nostrils flare, “You wanting to fuck the girl you’ve mentally swapped for your sister, makes me sad for you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI take a step towards her but she flinches so dramatically, I stop and point, “She is not my sister. Do not try to plant seeds in my head. I see you and your antics, Jane. And just so you know, I filmed our little evening together. With how shaky your reputation is, I’m certain whipping poor Eli Adams, the lost boy who shot his sister, isn’t going to win you your license back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe swallows awkwardly; it almost makes me hard. I smile, “I love dominating you in your office. Had we spent the evening here instead of at my place, I really believe we would have had a lot more fun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes glass over, “But then I would have missed being right about you and your dirty room of sin, and the fact you like to Dom and Sub.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, “Touché.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn and walk to the button for the elevator. She doesn’t move and I don’t turn back. I’m ready to snap her fucking neck, but I need her to save my girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe text messages start as I’m reaching the dorms. My heart beats faster seeing her little requests. She keeps me at arms length with them. Never treating me as if I am someone she is familiar with. She always acts like we don’t know each other. I hate that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI treat her the same way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hate that more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glance at the text, \u0027Can I go to the store?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh and pinch the bridge of my nose. I don’t know how many times I will have to explain the Visa to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI send her a message and dial Stuart, “Hey. She needs to go to the store. You still there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. I’m here. I have a feeling I won\u0027t be leaving here. Dr. Bradley just called and said to keep an eye on you. She said you seemed self-destructive.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snort into the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughs, “I told you not to bang her—she’s crazy. Takes one to know one, ya know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod, “I have no desire to have this conversation ever again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever. Tell her I’ll be ready when she is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe answers my question. “She needs twenty minutes. You good with then?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sigh, “You realize that’s not actually a sentence right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Carrot-in-ass-itis is affecting you again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hang up the phone and notice, she too, has left me a little chestnut of annoyance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘KK.’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, texting her a new message, \u0027KK is a typo, not a send off. Please speak like an adult\u0027\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI press send with a grin. They are all trying to drive me insane. I\u0027m convinced text talk will be the end of civilization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy desk is painful to sit at as she and Michelle get into the truck with Stuart. She\u0027s out in the city. I have to keep taking deep breaths, chanting that she needs to be this different person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir conversations are funny and distracting. I want to be in the truck with them, having fun with them. Stuart is charming and easy to gain their trust. Watching Michelle laugh and my girl blush makes me smile. I type slowly, letting my mind wander and wonder what it would be like. I know the things I am capable of. I know the person I am. I don’t need Jane to point out the fact that I won\u0027t ever be the man she needs, but I daydream anyway. It\u0027s not wrong to imagine if we had met in a bar and she had laughed at my joke, if I told jokes. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lost-boy-the-lonely-2/page-7.html","bookId":1889,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:31 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:02:31 PM"}
