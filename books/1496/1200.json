However, only a moment later, the light faded, and his divine sense began to dissolve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Can’t quite get the Go board….” he thought, sighing regretfully. Pulling his divine sense back, he sat down cross-legged and performed some breathing exercises until he was fully recovered. Then he stood up and sent his divine sense out again. Instead of targeting the Go board, though, he locked onto the Go piece. As it began to vibrate and emit bright light, he performed an incantation gesture with his right hand and then waved his finger through the air!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Go piece became a bright streak of light that shot out of the fan face and into the void. The energy on display far surpassed that of a celestial, and was more like that of an archaean expert. The fan itself trembled, and the startled Bai Xiaochun waved his finger in the direction of the sovereign’s arm!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the light hit the arm, a spectacular boom echoed out, and the arm was shoved backward several meters. At the same time, a hole appeared in it, the same size as the Go piece!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt only dug about three inches into the surface of the arm, but it caused the flesh to begin to decay for a moment before the fan’s powers of regeneration kicked in and healed the wound. Even still, Bai Xiaochun was shocked by the ferocity of the attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So… so strong!!” He was excited, but at the same time, didn’t want to injure the arm any further, and therefore didn’t dare to use it to do any more tests. Next, he used his authority over the fan to cause it to stop moving, and then he flew off of it into the void!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere, he performed an incantation gesture, calling upon his connection to the fan to send a bright stream of light shooting out from it. The light pierced through the void until it reached a certain spot, where it exploded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVibrations rolled out through the void, invisible, but detectable by Bai Xiaochun. Considering that he was now in the late Celestial Realm, and had already fought with an archaean once, he could tell exactly what those fluctuations indicated\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An archaean-level attack! It even seemed stronger than when the Vile-Emperor attacked me!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wonder how long it would take for the light from that Go piece to reach the Eternal Immortal Domains if I summoned it…?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I wonder how many times I could do it?!” After some more thought, he went further out into the void to do some tests and see how quickly the light could reach him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat he found was that as soon as he summoned it, it would appear in front of him, almost as if it were completely ignoring the space between the two of them!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEyes widening, he changed locations and did a few more tests. Afterward, he was convinced that it didn’t matter where he was, the light would come to him immediately!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now this is what I call a weapon!!” he said, throwing his head back and laughing uproariously. He continued to perform more tests. After fifteen, it reached the point where no light came.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that point, he realized that fifteen times in a row was the limit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I wonder if that means I can use it fifteen times every day!?” Fifteen times per day would be more than enough. Savoring this development, he returned to the fan, sending it along its way through the void as he sat down cross-legged to meditate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next day, he excitedly performed some more tests. However, it was to his shock that he got no response from the Go piece.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of a sudden, he started to get a bit nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No way…. Don’t tell me that you can only use it fifteen times total…?” The thought instantly caused him to want to moan in grief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStarting to obsess at the thought of what he might have lost out on, he waited for more time to pass. For an entire month, all of his tests met with failure…. By now, he was feeling profound regret for what he had done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe thought of having wasted fifteen archaean-level attacks made him wish he could smack himself silly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why did I have to go and waste them?!” he said, frowning and sighing in defiance. An entire year passed. Finally, he decided to perform another test, whereupon bright light suddenly began to shine from the Go piece. Apparently, after using all of the light, it would take a full year to recharge. Shooting to his feet, he began to laugh loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“From now on I\u0027m going to call the light from that Go piece… Archaean Luminescence!” Swishing his sleeve, he reveled in the sensation of having another trump card at his disposal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Once Wan\u0027er and Zimo are awake, I’ll go back to the Eternal Immortal Domains!” High-spirited and full of mettle, he looked back at the tower. Based on his calculations, there was only a year to go before Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo awoke!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBruiser would likely awaken along with them. Sadly, there didn’t seem to be any change in Song Que.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was at around this time that Bai Xiaochi woke up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearly, his divine sense was much stronger than before. After scanning the fan with it, he proudly materialized in front of Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey there, little Xiaochun. I have some issues with you being the new owner of this fan, and would like--” Before he could say anything further, Bai Xiaochun looked at him out of the corner of his eye and then unleashed a beam of Archaean Luminescence on him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe light instantly struck fear into the heart of Bai Xiaochi, who shivered and dodged to the side. When he looked back at Bai Xiaochun, all sense of arrogance was gone from him, and he looked like the picture of subservience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What did you just say?” Bai Xiaochun asked coolly, standing there with his hands clasped behind his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeart pounding with fear, Bai Xiaochi said, “I just said… that I… think you’re the most suitable person in all creation to own this legacy fan, milord!!”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNever could he have imagined that, while he slept, Bai Xiaochun would gain control over the Go piece all on his own!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have an idea,” Bai Xiaochun said, looking back at him. “Let’s talk about that name change you wanted. I’ve come up with the perfect name.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochi immediately began to wail inwardly with grief. Terrified of what name the vengeful Bai Xiaochun would give him, he quickly said, “Milord, after absorbing that large spirit automaton, many more powers have been awakened within me. Although I can\u0027t yet get those archaean slaves from the boat to leave the fan, I can summon them to you to be sparring partners. That way, you can get used to fighting with archaeans. And then, when you get back to the Eternal Immortal Domains, you’ll definitely dominate anyone who tries to fight you!”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorried that Bai Xiaochun might not believe him, or might not give him a chance to follow through on his offer, he performed an incantation gesture and threw all of the divine sense he could muster toward the fan face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstantly, one of the two archaean slaves shivered, and his eyes began to glow. Rising to his feet, he blurred into motion, flying up into the air within the world of the fan face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClasping hands, he bowed deeply in Bai Xiaochun’s direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Greetings, master!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Bai Xiaochun had hoped to take the archaean slaves with him, and was disappointed that he couldn’t, it would also be good to do some training with them. When Bai Xiaochi saw how his eyes were shining brightly, he breathed a sigh of relief in his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Milord,” he continued obsequiously, “the exalted sovereign captured these archaean slaves and sealed them with restrictive spells. Only a sovereign could possibly undo them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIgnoring Bai Xiaochi, Bai Xiaochun entered the world of the fan face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on. Let’s fight!” Even as the words left his mouth, he attacked.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1197\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1199\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1198","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:11 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:11 AM"}
