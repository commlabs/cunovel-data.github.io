{"id":77485,"no":84,"title":"Page 84","content":"\u003cp\u003e\"She is,\" Kev said. \"Why shouldn\u0027t she be?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because one should choose a wife using the ears, not the eyes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKev smiled slightly. \"Very wise.\" He glanced down at Cam again, thinking he was starting to look worse. \"If they need help making the sling to carry him-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, my men are fast. They\u0027ll be finished soon. But it must be made well, and strong, to carry a man of his size.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam \u0027s hands were twitching, his long fingers plucking fitfully at the blanket they had put over him. Kev took the cold hand and gripped it firmly, trying to warm and reassure him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rom phuro stared at the visible tattoo on Cam \u0027s forearm, the striking lines of the winged black horse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When did you meet Rohan?\" he asked quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKev gave him a startled glance, his protective grasp tightening on Cam \u0027s hand. \"How do you know his name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tribe leader smiled, his eyes warm. \"I know other things as well. You and your brother were separated for a long time.\" He touched the tattoo with his forefinger. \"And this mark… you have one, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKev stared at him without blinking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sounds of a minor to-do filtered in from outside, and someone came pushing through the doorway. A woman. With surprise and concern, Kev saw the gleam of white-blond hair. \"Win!\" he exclaimed, carefully setting Cam \u0027s hand down and coming to his feet. Unfortunately, he couldn\u0027t stand fully upright in the low-ceilinged vehicle. \"Tell me you didn\u0027t come here alone. It\u0027s not safe. Why are you-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m trying to help.\" The skirts of Win\u0027s riding habit rustled stiffly as she hurried into the vardo. One of her hands was ungloved, and she was holding something in it. She didn\u0027t spare a glance for the rom phuro, she was so intent on reaching Kev. \"Here. Here.\" She was breathing hard from riding to the camp at a breakneck pace, her cheeks flushed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\" Kev murmured, gently taking the object from her, his free hand coming to rub her back. He looked down at a small vial filled with powder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The antidote,\" she said. \"Give it to him quickly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know it\u0027s the right medicine?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I made Dr. Harrow tell me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He might have been lying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I\u0027m sure he wasn\u0027t, because at that moment he was nearly on f-I mean, he was under duress.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKev\u0027s fingers closed around the vial. There wasn\u0027t much choice. They could wait until they consulted a trustworthy doctor, but from the look of it, Cam didn\u0027t have much time to spare. And doing nothing was not an option, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKev proceeded to dissolve ten grains in a small quantity of water, reasoning that it was better to start with a weak solution rather than overdose Cam with yet another poison. He eased Cam to a sitting position, supporting him against his chest. Delirious and unsteady, Cam made a protesting noise as the movement sent new pain through his cramping muscles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Kev couldn\u0027t see Cam\u0027s face, he saw Win\u0027s compassionate expression as she reached out to grip Cam \u0027s jaw. She rubbed the frozen muscles and pried his mouth open. After tilting the liquid from a spoon into his mouth, she massaged his cheeks and throat, coaxing him to swallow. Cam downed the medicine and shuddered, and rested heavily against Kev.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you,\" Win whispered, stroking back Cam \u0027s damp hair, flattening her palm against the side of his cold face. \"You\u0027ll be better now. Lie easy, and let it take effect.\" Kev thought she had never looked as lovely as she did at that moment, her face soft with tender gravity. After a few minutes Win said quietly, \"His color is improving.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd so was his breathing, the jagged rhythm lengthening and slowing. Kev felt Cam \u0027s body relax, the clenched muscles softening as the active principles of the digitalis were neutralized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam stirred as if he were waking from a long sleep. \"Amelia,\" he said in an opium-slurred voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWin took one of his hands in hers. \"She\u0027s quite well, and waiting for you at home, dear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Home,\" he repeated with an exhausted nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKev lowered Cam carefully to the berth and looked over him in sharp assessment. The masklike pallor was vanishing second by second, healthy color returning to his face. The rapidity of the transformation was no less than astonishing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe amber eyes cracked open, and Cam focused on Kev. \"Merripen,\" Cam said in a tone so lucid that Kev was overcome with relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, phralT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Am I dead?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I must be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\" Kev asked, amused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because…\" Cam paused to moisten his dry lips. \"Because you\u0027re smiling… and I just saw my cousin Noah over there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter Twenty-two\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rom phuro came forward and knelt beside the berth. \"Hello, Camlo,\" he murmured.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam regarded him with puzzled wonder. \"Noah. You\u0027re older.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis cousin chuckled. \"Indeed. The last time I saw you, you barely came up to my chest. And now you look as if you could be nearly a head taller than me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never came back for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKev broke in tautly. \"And you never told him he had a brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNoah\u0027s smile turned regretful as he regarded them both. \"I couldn\u0027t do either of those things. For your own protection.\" His gaze swerved in Kev\u0027s direction. \"We were told you were dead, Kev. I\u0027m glad to find out we were wrong. How did you survive? Where have you been living?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seduce-me-at-sunrise-the-hathaways-2/page-84.html","bookId":1786,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:38:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:38:00 PM"}
