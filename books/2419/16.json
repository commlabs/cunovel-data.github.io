{"id":76546,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not sure what I\u0027d been expecting as a dropoff point, but this wasn\u0027t it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got a family?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight scowled. \"You don\u0027t need to come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he opened the truck door and fell into the driveway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI got out my side and came around to help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight was cursing the pavement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Should\u0027ve warned you about that first step,\" I apologized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m fine,\" he snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pushed my hand away, stumbled to his feet. I followed him to the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI heard children before we even got to the porch. A girl and a boy were yelling. Feet stomped. Porcelain crashed and a woman\u0027s limp voice escalated over the noise: \"No, no, no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight turned toward me. \"I\u0027m okay now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the door opened and a grinning Latino boy about eight said, \"Mr. Hayes, tell her to stop hitting me!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA younger AfricanAmerican girl pounced on the boy in a flurry of small fists. Both children yelled, did a oneeighty, and raced up the green shagcarpeted stairwell that faced the front door. Their thumping feet on the poorly constructed steps sounded like mallets on a cardboard box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight took a deep breath. Then he plunged into the house like he was entering the first circle of hell. He followed the children up the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dwight?\" a woman\u0027s voice called after him. \"Are you hurt, son?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDwight got to the top and turned the corner. He yelled, \"Get the hell out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Latino boy and his nemesis, the little girl, came rushing down the stairs, grinning, and disappeared into a room on the right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman\u0027s voice said, \"Chris, Amanda, no, no, no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite everything I\u0027d ever been warned about highrisk entries, I stepped inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe place smelled of longago meals—fried chicken, oranges, grilled cheese sandwiches. A wall unit AC was humming and whining somewhere in back, but it made no difference. The house was hotter than the summer night outside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the left was a den, illuminated only by a television. Half a dozen schoolaged children reclined on sofas, eating Cheetos and watching The Magic School Bus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo the right, where Chris and Amanda had run, a woman dominated a blue couch in the living room. A portrait of Jesus hung on the wall above her. At her feet, two toddlers sat Vlegged on the carpet amidst a Gettysburg of Legos and blocks. The last child—not counting however many might be packed into the closets—was an Anglo boy of about ten. He stood next to the woman, fanning her face with a piece of cardboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe woman smiled pleasantly at me. \"I\u0027m Mrs. Hayes. Are you Dwight\u0027s friend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked in her late fifties, paleskinned, not merely fat but big in every respect, from wrists to ankles to fingers. She wore a pink tentdress and gaudy makeup that struggled to create contours on her otherwise shapeless face. Her hair was the colour of diet cola, and looked like it had been cut and combed by a barber who usually did men.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI introduced myself, told her I\u0027d given Dwight a ride after he\u0027d had a minor accident at Scholz Garten.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer pleasant smile didn\u0027t change. \"Is my boy all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am. Just a little scraped up. Dwight\u0027ll be fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe nodded contentedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t help thinking about a white lab mouse I\u0027d once seen at A\u0026amp;M—a psychology maze graduate who\u0027d figured out how to push the reward button. The mouse was allowed to sit there all day long, punching, gorging, punching, gorging, until it became an enormous, fuzzy mound of rodent complacency, its pink eyes glazed and disconnected with the world beyond that quarterinchdiameter red circle which gave him bliss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Hayes looked like a woman who had found the reward button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris and Amanda did another lap through the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Hayes called after them halfheartedly, \"Chris!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy leapt over a toddler thumping blocks on the floor, knocked down a vase, kept running with the girl close behind. Mrs. Hayes blinked, mildly annoyed, like the food button was stuck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chris!\" she called again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next lap through the living room, Chris stopped. The girl ran into him. She pummeled his back while he waited for instructions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Chris,\" Mrs. Hayes said pleasantly, \"what video will keep the children quiet for a while?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Star Wars!\" he shouted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Austin Powers!\" protested the girl, whapping him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two of them started arguing. Mrs. Hayes looked ever so slightly pained. \"I don\u0027t approve of those choices, but I must have it quiet for a while. I\u0027m getting my headache again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris widened his eyes, as if Mrs. Hayes\u0027 headache was a thing to be avoided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ll figure it out, Mrs. H.,\" he promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChris and Amanda herded the two littler children out of the room, leaving us only the boy with the cardboard fan. Soon the sounds of screaming and chasing were replaced by roaring ships and blasting lasers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sat in the chair by the window. Mrs. Hayes smiled at me from her couch, the boy with the cardboard making her hair flicker with every sweep. My scalp started to itch from the heat. I wondered how much the kid charged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Mrs. Hayes said, starting over. \"You work for Matthew\u0027s company?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe said Matthew with lazy familiarity—two warm, fluffy syllables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, ma\u0027am,\" I said. \"You know Mr. Pena?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, goodness, yes. Matthew\u0027s been wonderful to my Dwight. They went to college together, you know. Would you like some iced tea?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t go to any trouble, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, it\u0027s no trouble.\" She waved toward the kitchen. \"I believe I\u0027d like some, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sat there beaming at each other for a few seconds before I realized I\u0027d received my marching orders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kitchen was all Formica and particleboard, the woodgrain veneer peeling away from the cabinets in large strips. The sink was piled with dishes. A Cheerios box was overturned on the counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took me a minute to find two clean glasses, then to find a pitcher in the refrigerator that held anything resembling iced tea. I opened the freezer for ice. On the bottom, swirling in mist, were little strips of notebook paper, each one with a name in cursive: Marcy, Deborah, Chris, Amanda, John, Clement. There were others in the back, stuck there so long they were grafted to the frost. I scraped away one. It said \"Dwight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kids in the den kept eating Cheetos, happily watching space ships detonate on TV. I filled two glasses and brought my spoils back into the living room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave one glass to Mrs. Hayes, then sat across from her on a wicker rocker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe kid with the fan said, \"Are you cool enough yet, Mrs. H.?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You keep going, Clem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe boy switched the cardboard to his other hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Hayes smiled at me. \"Clem stole money from my wallet last week. Now he\u0027s paying me back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They all try it when they first come here. \u0027Do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry.\u0027 \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClem kept fanning her, his face weary and bitter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Proverbs,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Hayes beamed approval. \"Yes, dear. Very good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Clem\u0027s name is in the freezer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, they\u0027re all in the freezer. All the ones I pray for. Children are forced to grow up too fast, nowadays. Don\u0027t you think?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sipped some tea. It had absorbed a residual taste of something else from the refrigerator—ham or bologna, something decidedly non kosher. I sat my glass on the end table. \"These are . . . neighbourhood children you take care of?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mostly,\" Mrs. Hayes said. \"Their parents work late and can\u0027t afford child care. This is my ministry to them. The house was so lonely after Dwight graduated. That\u0027s what started me taking in children. It was good of Matthew to arrange for Dwight to stay here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Matthew did that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore smiling. The reward button was working fine, now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He called me even before he\u0027d arranged it with Dwight. Said it seemed a shame, getting an expensive hotel room or an apartment, when Dwight could spend a few months here with me. Especially after all those years in California. Naturally, I agreed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Naturally. And when Dwight didn\u0027t want to impose?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Matthew insisted. Such a polite young man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbove Mrs. Hayes\u0027 head, the framed portrait of Jesus had his hands clasped, his eyes heavenward. If I stayed with Mrs. Hayes all day, I imagined I\u0027d look like that, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI thought about Dwight upstairs, probably in his boyhood room, Matthew Pena having a good laugh about it every night when he went to sleep in his luxury hotel. I wondered if Dwight had his head buried under a pillow right now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It isn\u0027t Dwight\u0027s fault,\" Mrs. Hayes mused. \"I don\u0027t expect him to do as well as Matthew has done, but I do tell him to pay attention, learn from Matthew. Matthew is so good at what he does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" I agreed. \"Very good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a crash in the den. A boy said something too soft to interpret? a girl giggled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Hayes took a deep breath. \"No, no, no!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the giggling didn\u0027t stop, Mrs. Hayes seemed to sniff the air for a scent, then called, \"Marcy and John. I know that was you. You come in here this minute.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother crash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Hayes sighed. Clem the fan boy started to smile, but quickly stifled it when he caught me looking at him. I gave him a wink.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should go,\" I said. \"Thanks for your hospitality, ma\u0027am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll keep you in my prayers, Tres.\" And then she gave me her empty bolognaflavoured tea glass to take to the kitchen on my way out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I left, Mrs. Hayes was still calling from her couch for the children to behave. Clem was fanning her hair into a cowlick with his piece of cardboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped out into the cooler summer night and said a silent prayer to Our Saviour of the Sofa Painting that my name would not be going into Mrs. Hayes\u0027 freezer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCHAPTER 14\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Now tell me this wasn\u0027t worth it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby McBride set Garrett\u0027s folded wheelchair on the deck and waved her hand toward the horizon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGarrett unclamped his arms from around my neck, transferring himself to the bench that ran around the railing. I tried not to wheeze too hard. Nothing like carrying your brother up three flights of stairs to burst your illusions of being in good shape.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRuby\u0027s houseinprogress was a square tower, built on the slope of a hill overlooking Point Lone Star—a roughly triangular piece of land that jutted into Lake Travis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe business part of her property was at the shoreline, about a hundred yards downhill—a wellilluminated marina, a small floating restaurant, a drivedown boat launch. She even had a warehouse for drystacking and a giant forklift with padded teeth for retrieving the boats. A glowing pier stuck into the water and Yed about ten yards out, making two rows of wet slips for yachts. There were maybe a dozen boats docked—from twentyfooters all the way up to sixtyfooters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lake was scored with moonlight. Lights from other palatial homes sprinkled the hills on the far shore. The Milky Way shimmered above us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, not a bad view.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The plumbing works,\" Ruby announced. She waved toward a sliding glass door that led into an unfinished kitchen/breakfast area. The room was starkly lit, glowing in the night like an empty fish\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etank. \"So if you need the john, gentlemen, please don\u0027t whiz off my balcony.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-devil-went-down-to-austin-tres-navarre-4/page-16.html","bookId":2419,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 3:21:11 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:21:11 PM"}
