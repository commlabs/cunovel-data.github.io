They\u0027d want to know where all the bodies were buried, and that\u0027s not a figure of speech. I\u0027d be on the spot for failing to report the murders of Kenny and McCartney, and for in fact actively covering up their deaths. We broke a lot of laws the night we dug up Mick\u0027s back yard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027d lose your license.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the least of it. I could face criminal charges.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t think of that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems to me I committed a couple of felonies,\" I said, \"and we crossed a state line with a trunkful of corpses, so there might be a federal charge involved as well. Even so, I might have taken my chances if I\u0027d thought leveling with Wister would do any good.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It won\u0027t bring Jim back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but neither will anything else. It won\u0027t catch his killer, either. Jim was an innocent bystander who walked into the middle of a gang war.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that what it is? Gang warfare?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what it looks like. That\u0027s what it looked like in the storage room in Jersey. If I\u0027d had any sense I\u0027d have bowed out then and there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wish you would stop blaming yourself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let that pass. She\u0027d said it more than once, and I still didn\u0027t have a response to it. I said, \"There are things the cops are good at, but solving gang-related homicides isn\u0027t one of them. Even when they get lucky and learn who gave the order and who pulled the trigger, they can\u0027t put together a case that\u0027ll hold up in court.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I guess they\u0027re helpless against organized crime.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not exactly helpless. The RICO laws gave them broad powers, and in the past few years they\u0027ve made some major cases and put away a lot of mob guys. They\u0027ll get somebody to wear a wire, they\u0027ll get somebody else to roll over on his boss, and next thing you know there\u0027s one more guy in the federal joint at Marion, complaining that nobody there can make a decent marinara sauce. That works, and so do some of the local stings they run, like renting a storefront and receiving stolen goods, then locking up all the people who walked in the door with minks and TV sets.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They get a lot of press when they do that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I\u0027m sure that\u0027s one of the things they like about it. But it\u0027s good police work just the same. Some of my contemporaries might disagree, but I think the NYPD\u0027s better than when I was a part of it. They\u0027re doing a superior job. But that doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027re going to come up with the guy who shot Jim.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Still,\" she said, \"it bothers you that you held out on them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think it would bother me more if I hadn\u0027t. I\u0027d have had fun explaining a lot of things, including the gun I was carrying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was wondering about that. Nobody spotted it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t a suspect and nobody had any reason to pat me down. I kept my windbreaker zipped up. It was chilly in the restaurant and on the street, but it was warm and stuffy in the squad room at Midtown North. I kept waiting for Wister to tell me to take off my jacket and get comfortable, but he never did.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if you\u0027d told them you were the intended victim…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then they\u0027d have asked me a few hundred questions, and everything would have had to come out, including the gun. \u0027This? Well, you\u0027ve already got the murder weapon, and anyway this is a.38, not a.22, and you can see it hasn\u0027t been fired recently. I haven\u0027t registered it yet because I just acquired it the other day from this guy who was pounding on my stomach.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How is your stomach, by the way?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it must be empty. You didn\u0027t get dinner, you haven\u0027t had anything since lunch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you say so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why the look?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just thinking what Jim would say about letting yourself get too hungry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027d say not to,\" I said. \"But I\u0027m not hungry. Right now the thought of food turns my stomach.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you change your mind…\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll let you know. Say, is there any coffee? I could stand a cup of coffee.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What bothers me,\" I said, \"is that I held out without thinking twice. It was second nature.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe were at the kitchen table, with coffee for me and herbal tea for her. I had taken off the windbreaker, and the gun and holster. I\u0027d taken off the polo shirt, shucked the Kevlar vest, and put the shirt back on again. The vest was draped over the back of a chair now, and the gun and holster were on the kitchen counter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said, \"I was a cop for a lot of years, and then for a long time I worked private without a license. I finally got one because it was an inconvenience not to have it, and it was costing me work. But there was another reason. I had it in the back of my mind that it would make me respectable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You never said that before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When you and I got married,\" she said, \"I told you something. Do you remember what it was?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just thinking about it the other day. You said it didn\u0027t have to change anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because we were already committed to each other, so how could a piece of paper change things? And you were already respectable.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe that\u0027s the wrong word. Maybe I was looking for the license to make me more legitimate, more a part of the establishment.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And did it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s the thing,\" I said. \"It didn\u0027t. You know, I lost most of my illusions about the system during my years as a cop. They say working in a meat-packing plant ruins your appetite for sausage, and something similar happens on the job. You\u0027re essentially taught to break the rules. I learned to cut corners, learned to stand up in court and lie under oath. I also took bribes and robbed the dead, but that was something else, that was more about the erosion of my own morals. It may have been job-related, but it didn\u0027t arise directly out of how I\u0027d learned to regard the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I put in my papers and quit,\" I went on, \"and you know about that. It was abrupt, one day I was a cop and one day I wasn\u0027t, but in another sense it was a more gradual process. I was still a cop at heart. All I lacked was a badge and a paycheck. I still saw the world the same way. I knew guys working in houses all over the five boroughs, and I pulled strings and called in favors when I was working my own cases. Or I bought favors, paying cops for information as if they were my snitches.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, the years went by,\" I said, \"and everybody I knew died or retired. Joe Durkin\u0027s my only real friend on the job, and I never even knew him back then. I\u0027d been working private for years before he and I got acquainted. And now he\u0027s always talking about retiring himself, and one of these days he\u0027ll do it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Suppose it had been him instead of Wister asking you questions tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would I have told the same lies? Probably. I don\u0027t see what else I could have done. I might have been a little less comfortable lying to Joe, and he might have sensed I was holding out. As far as that goes, Wister may have sensed as much himself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s complicated, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very. It\u0027s hard to know what I am. \u0027My name is Matt and I\u0027m an alcoholic.\u0027 I\u0027ve said that so many times I\u0027m beginning to believe it, but beyond that point it gets a little fuzzy. For years I\u0027ve been cutting corners and making my own rules. I learned how on the job and I never learned how not to. I\u0027ve deliberately subverted the law, and now and then I\u0027ve taken it into my own hands. I\u0027ve played judge and jury. Sometimes I guess I\u0027ve played God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You always had a reason.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everybody can always find a reason. The point is I\u0027ve done illegal acts, and I\u0027ve worked for and with criminals, but I\u0027ve never thought of myself as a criminal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, of course not. You\u0027re not a criminal.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not sure what I am. I tell myself I try to do what\u0027s right, but I don\u0027t know how I make that determination. The phrase that comes to mind is \u0027moral compass,\u0027 but I\u0027m not sure I know exactly what a moral compass is, or if I have one.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you do, honey. But the needle keeps spinning around, doesn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The only rule I\u0027ve got to live by,\" I said, \"is \u0027Don\u0027t drink and go to meetings.\u0027 Jim says if I do that much everything else\u0027ll work out the way it\u0027s supposed to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you do and it does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, it works out. That\u0027s another thing he told me, things always work out. And God\u0027s will always gets done. That\u0027s how you find out God\u0027s will. You wait and see what happens.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve quoted that line before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve always liked it,\" I said. \"I guess it was God\u0027s will for Jim to die tonight, and for me to live. Otherwise it wouldn\u0027t have happened, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Right.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sometimes,\" I said, \"it\u0027s hard to figure out what God has in mind. Sometimes you have to wonder if He\u0027s paying attention.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe talked for a long time. Ages ago, in another lifetime, when she was a hooker and I was a cop married to somebody else, part of what drew me to her was that she was so easy to talk to. In a sense I suppose that was part of the job description in her chosen field. A call girl, after all, ought to put men at ease. But it seemed to go beyond that for us. I sensed that I could be entirely myself in her presence, that it was me she liked, not the man I pretended to be, not the man I thought the world wanted me to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe that, too, was part of the job description.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drank coffee and she sipped her herb tea and I talked about Jim. I told stories from early sobriety, before she and I had found each other again after having been out of touch for years. \"At first I figured he was a nice enough fellow,\" I told her, \"but I wished to God he would leave me alone, because I knew I wasn\u0027t going to stay sober and he was just one more person to disappoint. Then I started to look forward to seeing him at meetings. As far as I was concerned he was Mister AA himself, the voice of sobriety. As a matter of fact he came into the program less than two years before I did. I was in my first ninety days when I heard him speak on his second anniversary. I look back now, and what\u0027s two years? A person with two years is just beginning to clear the cobwebs out of his head. So he was actually pretty new himself, but from my perspective he was dry enough to be a fire hazard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would he tell you now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What would he tell me? He\u0027ll never tell me anything again.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if he could.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sighed. \"\u0027Don\u0027t drink. And go to meetings.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you want to go to a meeting now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s too late for the midnight meeting on Houston Street. They\u0027ve got another one at two a.m., but that\u0027s too late for me. So no, I don\u0027t want to go, but I don\u0027t want to drink, either, so I guess it evens out.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What else would he tell you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t read his mind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but you can use your imagination. What would he say?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrudgingly I said, \"\u0027Get on with your life.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And are you going to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Get on with my life? I don\u0027t really have a choice, do I? But it\u0027s not that easy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why not?\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everybody-dies-matthew-scudder-14/page-14.html","bookId":2332,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:54:35 AM"}
