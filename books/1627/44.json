This took him outside again, into the big cobbled area that surrounded the palace. Now he could get his bearings, now he could . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a boom in the air above him. A gale blew downwards, knocking him over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe King of Ankh-Morpork, wings outspread, glided across the sky and settled for a moment on the palace gateway, talons gouging long scars in the stone as it caught its balance. The sun glittered off its arched back as it stretched its neck, roared a lazy billow of flames, and sprang into the air again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes made an animal-a mammalian animal-noise in the back of his throat, and ran out into the empty streets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSilence filled the ancestral home of the Ramkins. The front door swung back and forth on its hinges, letting in the common, badly-brought up breeze which wandered through the deserted rooms, gawping and looking for dust on the top of the furniture. It wound up the stairs and banged through the door of Sybil Ramkin\u0027s bedroom, rattling the bottles on the dressing table and riffling through the pages of Diseases of the Dragon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA really fast reader could have learned the symptoms of everything from Abated Heels to Zigzag Throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd down below, in the low, warm and foul-smelling shed that housed the swamp dragons, it seemed that Errol had got them all. Now he sat in the centre of his pen, swaying and moaning softly. White smoke rolled slowly from his ears and drifted towards the floor. From somewhere inside his swollen stomach came complex explosive hydraulic noises, as though desperate teams of gnomes were trying to drive a culvert through a cliff in a thunderstorm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis nostrils flared, turning more or less of their own volition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other dragons craned over the pen walls, watching him cautiously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another distant gastric roar. Errol shifted painfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragons exchanged glances. Then, one by one, they lay down carefully on the floor and put their paws over their eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNobby put his head on one side. “It looks promising,” he said critically. “We might be nearly there. I reckon the chances of a man with soot on his face, his tongue sticking out, standing on one leg and singing The Hedgehog Song ever hitting a dragon\u0027s voonerables would be ... what\u0027d you say, Carrot?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A million to one, I reckon,” said Carrot virtuously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColon glared at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Listen, lads,” he said, “you\u0027re not winding me up, are you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrot looked down at the plaza below them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, bloody hell,” he said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wassat?” said Colon urgently, looking around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They\u0027re chaining a woman to a rock!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rank stared over the parapet. The huge and silent crowd that lined the plaza stared too, at a white figure struggling between half a dozen palace guards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wonder where they got the rock from?” said Colon. “We\u0027re on loam here, you know.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fine strapping wench, whoever she is,” said Nobby approvingly, as one of the guards wheeled off bow-legged and collapsed. “That\u0027s one lad who won\u0027t know what to do with his evenin\u0027s for a few weeks. Got a mean right knee, so she has.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Anyone we know?” said Colon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrot squinted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It\u0027s Lady Ramkin!” he said, his mouth dropping open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He\u0027s right. In a nightie,” said Nobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The buggers!” Colon snatched up his bow and fumbled for an arrow. “I\u0027ll give \u0027em voonerables! Well-spoken lady like her, it\u0027s a disgrace!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Er,” said Carrot, who had glanced over his shoulder. “Sergeant?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is what it comes to!” muttered Colon. \"Decent women can\u0027t walk down the street without being eaten!

Its neck stretched out straight ahead, the pilot flames of its nostrils streamed behind it, the sound of its flight panned across the sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColon\u0027s hands shook. The dragon seemed to be aiming at his throat, and it was moving too fast, far too fast. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is it!” said Carrot. He glanced towards the Hub, in case any gods had forgotten what they were there for, and added, speaking slowly and distinctly, “It\u0027s a million-to-one-chance, but it might just work!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Fire the bloody thing!” screamed Nobby.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Picking my spot, lad, picking my spot,” quavered Colon. “Don\u0027t you worry, lads, I told you this is my lucky arrow. First-class arrow, this arrow, had it since I was a lad, you\u0027d be amazed at the things I shot at with this, don\u0027t you worry.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe paused, as the nightmare bore down on him on wings of terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Er, Carrot?” he said meekly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, Sarge?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did your old grandad ever say what a voonerable spot looks like?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then the dragon wasn\u0027t approaching any more, it was there, passing a few feet overhead, a streaming mosaic of scales and noise, filling the entire sky.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColon fired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey watched the arrow rise straight and true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes half-ran, half-staggered over the damp cobbles, out of breath and out of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt can\u0027t be like this, he thought wildly. The hero always cuts it fine, but he always get there just in the nick of time. Only the nick of time was probably five minutes ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I\u0027m not a hero. I\u0027m out of condition, and I need a drink, and I get a handful of dollars a month without plumes allowance. That\u0027s not hero\u0027s pay. Heroes get kingdoms and princesses, and they take regular exercise, and when they smile the light glints off their teeth, ting. The bastards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweat stung his eyes. The rush of adrenaline that had carried him out of the palace had spent itself, and was now exacting its inevitable toll.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stumbled to a halt, and grabbed a wall to keep him upright while he gasped for air. And thus he saw the figures on the rooftop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, no! he thought. They\u0027re not heroes either! What do they think they\u0027re playing at?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a million-to-one chance. And who was to say that, somewhere in the millions of other possible universes, it might not have worked?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the sort of thing the gods really liked. But Chance, who sometimes can overrule even the gods, has 999,999 casting votes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this universe, for example, the arrow bounced off a scale and clattered away into oblivion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColon stared as the dragon\u0027s pointed tail passed overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It . . . missed . . .”he mouthed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But it couldn\u0027t of missed!” He stared red-eyed at the other two. “It was a sodding last desperate million-to-one chance!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon twisted its wings, swung its huge bulk around on a pivot of air, and bore down on the roof.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarrot grabbed Nobby around the waist and laid a hand on Colon\u0027s shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sergeant was weeping with rage and frustration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Million-to-bloody-one last desperate bloody chance!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sarge-”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dragon flamed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a beautifully controlled line of plasma. It went through the roof like butter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt cut through stairways.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt crackled into ancient timbers and made them twist like paper. It sliced into pipes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt punched through floor after floor like the fist of an angry god and, eventually, reached the big copper vat containing a thousand gallons of freshly-made mature whisky-type spirit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt burned into that, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, the chances of anyone surviving the ensuing explosion were exactly a million-to-one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fireball rose like a-well, a rose. A huge orange rose, streaked with yellow. It took the roof with it and wrapped it around the astonished dragon, lifting it high into the air in a boiling cloud of broken timber and bits of piping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd watched in bemusement as the superhot blast flung it into the sky and barely noticed Vimes as he pushed his way, wheezing and crying, through the press of bodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shouldered past a row of palace guards and shambled as fast as he could across the flagstones. No-one was paying him much attention at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0027t a rock, because Ankh-Morpork was on loam. It was just some huge remnant of mortared masonry, probably thousands of years old, from somewhere in the city foundations. Ankh-Morpork was so old now that what it was built on, by and large, was Ankh-Morpork.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been dragged into the centre of the plaza, and Lady Sybil Ramkin had been chained to it. She appeared to be wearing a nightie and huge rubber boots. By the look of her she had been in a fight, and Vimes felt a momentary pang of sympathy for whoever else had been involved. She gave him a look of pure fury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waved the cleaver vaguely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But why you-?” he began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Captain Vimes,” she said sharply, “you will oblige me by not waving that thing about and you will start putting it to its proper use!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes wasn\u0027t listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thirty dollars a month!” he muttered. “That\u0027s what they died for! Thirty dollars! And I docked some from Nobby. I had to, didn\u0027t I? I mean, that man could make a melon go rusty!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Captain Vimes!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe focused on the cleaver.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh,” he said. “Yes. Right!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a good steel cleaver, and the chains were elderly and rather rusty iron. He hacked away, raising sparks from the masonry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd watched in silence, but several palace guards hurried towards him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell do you think you\u0027re doing?” said one of them, who didn\u0027t have much imagination.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What the hell do you think you\u0027re doing?” Vimes growled, looking up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey stared at him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVimes took another hack at the chains. Several loops tinkled to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right, you\u0027ve asked for-” one of the guards began. Vimes\u0027s elbow caught him under his rib cage; before he collapsed, Vimes\u0027s foot kicked savagely at the other one\u0027s kneecaps, bringing his chin down ready for another stab with the other elbow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Right,” said Vimes absently. He rubbed the elbow. It was sheer agony.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe moved the cleaver to his other hand and hammered at the chains again, aware at the back of his mind that more guards were hurrying up, but with that special kind of run that guards had. He knew it well. It was the run that said, there\u0027s a dozen of us, let someone else get there first. It said, he looks ready to kill, no-one\u0027s paying me to get killed, maybe if I run slowly enough he\u0027ll get away . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo point in spoiling a good day by catching someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLady Ramkin shook herself free. A ragged cheer went up and started to grow in volume. Even in their current state of mind, the people of Ankh-Morpork always appreciated a performance. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/guards-guards-discworld-8/page-44.html","bookId":1627,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:17:54 PM"}
