The average person’s spiritual sea really contained a sea that was the manifestation of their mental strength and soul force.

In the legends, when a universe plunged into entropy and neared the brink of destruction, it would evolve into such a scene. The stars would completely burn out, turning into black holes. All of space would become twisted and highly unstable. Once a universe entered such a state, it would begin to slowly collapse until it finally exploded, destroying itself and continuing a cycle of rebirth.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style\u003d\"\"\u003eMo Eversnow faintly guessed that the reason Heavenly Empress Xuanqing died was a soul attack.

With Mo Eversnow’s strength, wanting to completely repair this spiritual sea was impossible.

The reason this junior is able to see the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace is not my own ability, but because of the power of blood vitality that I absorbed, which was left behind by Senior Primordius.
