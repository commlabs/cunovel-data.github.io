Even with the crop blight that was hitting the local farms, and the resulting economic slump, Halloween was still the number-​one business in Pine Deep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMunching bacon, Crow assessed Henry Guthrie. Val’s dad was getting up there now, and high-​tech farming or not the fields took their toll. He looked every one of his sixty-​four years, and perhaps a bit more. His bushy black eyebrows had become wilder and shot with silver, and since Val’s mother died two years ago, Guthrie’s head of hair had gone completely gray. Even so, his blueberry-​blue eyes sparkled with youth and mischief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m thinking of taking Val to New Hope next weekend. Just to get away for a day or so. Can you spare her?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well,” Guthrie said, considering, “without her the farm will collapse, I’ll be financially ruined and will have to live in a cardboard box under the overpass, but other than that I don’t see why you two shouldn’t have some time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cool.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I ran into your buddy—His Honor, I mean.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Terry? Where’d you trip over him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGuthrie almost said that they’d met in the waiting room of the psychiatrist they both shared—Henry for grief management and Terry for who knew what?—but shifted into a different lane when he realized he didn’t know if Crow knew that Terry Wolfe was in therapy at all. He said, “In town. I had a few errands to run.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrow grunted, eating more bacon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He doesn’t look too good these days,” Guthrie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah. He says he’s been having trouble sleeping. Nightmares, that sort of thing.” Crow wasn’t looking at Guthrie while he spoke. He was having some nightmares as well, and didn’t want Val’s very sharp and perceptive dad to see anything in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, I hope he takes care of himself. Terry always was a little high-​strung.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe batwing saloon doors that separated the kitchen from the main dining room creaked as Mark Guthrie, Val’s brother, pushed through. He was a few years younger than Val but was beefy and out of shape, and unlike his father Mark was starting to lose his hair. He wore a gray wool business suit and was reading the headlines of the Black Marsh Sentinel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Morning, Dad, morning, Crow.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” Crow said, waving at him with a forkful of sausage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s all on the table,” Guthrie said. “Sit down and let me pour you a cup.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey sat there and ate, and Mark gently shifted the conversation to local business, discussing the financial crisis in town without actually mentioning the phrase “crop blight.” So far it hadn’t hit the Guthrie farm, but some of their neighbors had been devastated by it. Mark, who was a nice but rather pedantic guy, offered his views on how to solve everyone’s financial woes by the right investments. Guthrie nodded as if he agreed, which he didn’t, and Crow ate his way through a lot of the food. Val’s brother ran the student aid department of Pinelands College and therefore held himself up as an expert on anything dealing with finances.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrow let him talk, grunting and nodding whenever there was a pause, and when there was an opening, he jumped in and said, “Well, fellas, much as I hate to eat and run…I’m going to anyway. Mark, see you around. Henry, I’ll probably see you later. Val said she’s going to make dinner for me tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth of the Guthrie men stared at him as if he’d just said that blue ferrets were going to pop out of his ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Val?” Guthrie said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Cook?” Mark said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd they burst out laughing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If she hears you she will so kick both your asses,” said Crow, but they were right. In all the years Crow and Val had known each other she’d only cooked for him a few times and it had always ended badly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were still laughing as Crow jogged upstairs, gently pushed aside the hair dryer, kissed Val in a way that made them both tingle, and then ran downstairs again. Now Henry and Mark were exchanging horror stories about some of Val’s previous attempts at cooking. Mark was as red as a beet and slapping his palm on the table as they guffawed about something dealing with a pumpkin pie and a case of dysentery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhistling to himself, Crow strolled across the broad gravel driveway to where his old Chevy squatted under a beech tree. The song he was whistling was “Black Ghost Blues,” though he wasn’t consciously aware of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerry Wolfe rolled over onto his side as if in sleep he was trying to turn away from his dream. It didn’t work. The dream pursued him, as determined this morning as it had been for the last ten nights. As cruelly persistent as it had been, off and on, since the season had begun. Since the blight had started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis face and throat were slick with sweat. Beside him, Sarah moaned softly in her sleep, her dreams also troubled, but in a less specific way, as if the content of hidden dreams tainted hers, but somehow in her sleep she was only aware of a sense of threat rather than of the nature of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerry’s hands gripped his pillow with ferocious force, his fingernails clawing at the thick cool cotton as he dreamed….\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn dreams Terry was not Terry. In dreams, Terry was something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn dreams, Terry did not lie sleeping next to his wife. In dreams, Terry always woke up and turned to Sarah and…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe part of Terry that was aware that he was dreaming cringed as he watched what the dreaming thing did. That part of Terry cringed and cried out and wept as he watched the thing pull back the covers from Sarah’s sleeping form and bend over her, dark eyes flashing as they drank in her curves and her softness and her vulnerability. The watching Terry tried to scream as the thing opened its mouth—and the sleeping body of Terry Wolfe actually opened his mouth, too—and leaned closer still to Sarah, teeth bared, mouth watering with an awful hunger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo! the watching Terry screamed—but the scream only took the form of a choked growl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was enough, though. The tightening of his throat and the desperation of his need to cry out snapped the line that tethered him to the nightmare and he popped awake. He lay there, chest heaving, throat raw from the strangled cry, sweat soaking him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere behind the curtains morning birds absurdly argued that it was a sunny, wonderful day and all was right with the world. Terry would gladly have taken a shotgun to them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat up, his muscles aching from the long hours of dreaming tension. Sarah was still asleep, curled into a ball, her face buried in a spill of black hair and crumpled pillows. Standing, Terry looked down at her, at her lovely lines, smelling the faintness of her perfume in the bedroom air. He loved her so much that tears burned in his eyes and he wondered—not for the first time—if he should kill himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery morning the idea had more appeal, and every morning it seemed like it would be the best thing he could ever do for her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTerry wrenched himself away from staring at her and lumbered into the bathroom. He leaned both hands on the cool rim of the sink and stared at his reflection. Every day there was just a moment of dread when he brought his face to the mirror—wondering if today was the day he would see the beast and not the man, if today he would wear the face he wore in his dreams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was just his own face. Broad, square, with curly red hair, a short beard that was not as precisely trimmed as it once was. Bloodshot blue eyes that looked back at him, shifty and full of guilt for something he just could not name. He was five weeks shy of forty and normally looked five years younger than that. Now he looked fifty, or even sixty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opened the medicine cabinet and selected from among a dozen orange-​brown prescription bottles until he found the clozapine, tipped one into his mouth, and washed it down with four glasses of water. The antipsychotic gave him terrible dry mouth. He put another of the pills into a small plastic pill case along with half a dozen Xanax and snapped it shut, feeling edgy and strangely guilty as he did so. He glanced up at the mirror again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good morning, Mr. Mayor,” he said, hating the face he saw, and then he set about washing and brushing and constructing the face he needed everyone else in town to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrow pulled out of the long Guthrie driveway and turned northeast along Interstate Extension A-32, heading to Old Mill Road and the Haunted Hayride that was nestled back in between the Pinelands College campus and the sprawling southern reach of the great Pine Deep State Forest. He had stopped whistling to himself and was now singing along badly to a Nick Cave CD. As his battered old Chevy, Missy, rolled up between corn farms and berry farms, Crow sang his way through the Bad Seeds’ raucous and obscene version of “Stagger Lee,” a song he could never play in anything like polite company. To Crow, there was nothing particularly strange about starting a lovely late September morning off with a ballad about mass murder and pederasty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sang badly and loud and the miles rolled away as the car took the hills and jags and twists of A-32 with practiced ease.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA busload of migrant day workers passed, heading for the Guthrie farm, and Crow tooted to Toby, the driver and crew boss. A few of the workers waved at him and he waved back. Most of them were Haitians and there were half a dozen among them that Henry Guthrie was considering taking on full-​time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind the bus were two cars—both with people Crow knew—and beyond them the first of the day’s school buses. It was just hitting 7:00 a.m. and already the town was up and about. Nobody sleeps late in farm country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrow’s cell phone beeped—the tune was “I Got My Mojo Working”—and he flipped it open. “Hello, Miss Beechum’s Country Dayschool,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey there,” Val said. “I just had a very, very nice flashback.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned down the CD player. “Yeah, baby…me too. You are the most delicious woman in the world, you know that?” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ghost-road-blues-pine-deep-1/page-6.html","bookId":2567,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:51:54 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:51:54 PM"}
