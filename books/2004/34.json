Will you marry me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOddly enough, Bridget’s entire life flashed before her eyes. Which was really weird, considering she wasn’t dying or anything, but it did. In an instant, everything she had ever been and ever would be collided. Her heart swelled. Happiness rushed over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes locked with his and the words came out. “Yes. Yes!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a thunderous roar as Chad rose to his feet and slipped the ring on. It was a little big, but she couldn’t care about that in the moment. Looking up at Chad, she closed her eyes as his lips descended on hers in the sweetest, most tender kiss they ever shared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Holy shit,” she heard Chase say again, and Chad and her parted, laughing as they saw his dumbstruck brother standing next to Madison.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWrapping his arms around Bridget, Chad lowered his mouth to her ear. “Thank you,” he said. “Thank you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe burrowed her face into his neck as she clutched his arms. “You do deserve me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe slid his arms to her waist. “Then show me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe so got what he was referencing. Grabbing Chad by the arm, she shot the director an apologetic smile. “Sorry about the circus. Really, I am.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirector Bernstein looked as stunned as she felt, but she kept going, leading Chad out into the lobby and down the hall. They made a pit stop in the first room they found—a small storage room holding the wine for the Gala. It was chilled in there, but it was perfect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChad locked the door behind him and turned to her, eyes flaring a deep blue. “I need to hear you say it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer heart fluttered. “I love you, Chad. I wanted to tell you that on Christmas, but—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But I acted like a douche, I know.” He came up to her and reached up, tugging her hair down so it was a mess of waves and curls. “I want to spend the rest of my life making up for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmazing how those words turned her on more than anything in this world. “Then start making up for it now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I like that. Bossy pants.” His head dipped and he kissed her—kissed her in a way that was so different from before, as if he was telling her that he knew he had her, and he was never letting go. “Think you can handle marrying a player?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridget slid her hand between them, finding where he was already ready for her. “As long as he’s a player only on the field, yes.” She cupped him and smiled when he moaned against her lips. “You think you can handle me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a split second, Chad had her flipped around, her back pressed against his front. “What do you think?” His breath was hot in her ear as he slid a hand up her thigh. “No stockings. I have to say I agree.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer panties were gone before she could even say a word. They ended up down by her ankles and she stepped out of them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s my girl.” He kissed the back of her neck. “That’s my soon-to-be wife.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sound of his zipper coming down almost had her coming right then. There was no other warning. He slid into her, his rhythm hot and furious, relentless and beautiful, as he guided her neck back, bringing his mouth to hers. Both were panting, their hips rocking into each other as he took them to a soul-shattering release that left them breathless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Chad spun her around to face him, he kissed her deeply and held her against him, every so often dropping a kiss to her cheek and then her eyelids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I guess I do have to thank Miss Gore,” Bridget admitted when she could speak again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What for?” Chad straightened the hem on her dress and then pressed a kiss to her throat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe smiled up at him, her heart swelling so fast she was sure it was going to burst. “For you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChad cupped her cheeks. “You’re right, but I’m the one who needs to be thanking her. She brought you back into my life. Let’s never tell her, though” he said, kissing her lips. “She can come to the wedding, but God knows her head can’t get any bigger. She doesn’t need our help.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBridget laughed as she looped her arms around Chad’s neck, happier than she ever believed possible—with Chad Gamble of all people, a player on the field and a reformed one off. And all because of the publicist from hell. Funny how things worked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Agreed,” she said, smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChad dipped his head once more and based on the way he was kissing her, taking her into him over and over again, they wouldn’t be leaving the wine room anytime soon. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tempting-the-player-gamble-brothers-2/page-34.html","bookId":2004,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:38:04 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:38:04 PM"}
