When he caught me close, I smelled his scent rising with the promise of snow, a strange mix of sun and darkness, sandalwood and fir trees, old wood and new blud. The dancers around us became as inconsequential as ashes in a storm, fluttery bits of nothing. Our eyes were caught and burning, our feet moving like leaves on the wind. I didn’t realize the song was over until he had spun me out and bowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking my hand, he led me toward a table of treats tended by low-ranking blud servants. I looked down, hoping they wouldn’t recognize me but knowing that it was expected for us to partake and that every drop of blood made me stronger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCasper had no way of knowing all of the clever and indulgent ways to enjoy a Bludman’s feast, so I took up a curl of candied tangerine dipped in blood sugar and held it to his lips. His mouth twitched, and his eyes narrowed, but he knew better than to reject it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That is so very weird,” he said, chewing. “I like it, and I hate it. But it’s familiar.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI popped a piece into my mouth and tried to imagine what it would be like, tasting it for the first time. The tart, bright twist of the orange coupled with the waxy blood and the crystalline coating. But I couldn’t tease it apart. I had always loved this taste, just as I had always lived this life in my body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you happy?” I asked him before my brain caught up with my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I exist as I am, and that is enough. If no other in the world be aware I sit content.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Bah. A ball is no place for your philosophies, Master . . .” I trailed off. Sterling was a Pinky name, the sort of overtly pleasant thing they had adopted when they had begun to take over the parts of the world where Bludmen were considered monsters. His name had to be powerful, careless, cruel. “Master Scathing,” I said, liking the flavor of it in my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That won’t . . . I’m not . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sniveling? Strafing? Starving? Savage?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor just a moment there, he was human again, and struggling. Then, as if shaking off water, he suddenly seemed a foot taller and a foot wider, his eyes filled with thunder and staring over my shoulder at some new threat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Would the lady care to dance?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned, mouth open in surprise, to find one of the two dandies I had recognized earlier. Dancing with him was the last thing on Sang that I wanted to do, and yet to deny him would have caused even more aggravation. I forced a smile and nodded, and he took my hand carefully, as if it might suddenly turn in his grasp like a snake. I tried to recall his name and failed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next dance was, damnably, a slow one. I placed my hand on his shoulder in the correct place, and he looked at it as if I planned on ripping a hole in his perfectly tailored violet jacket. His other hand landed lightly on my hip, as if I were a piece of furniture instead of a person, and he began to move me mechanically around the floor, whisking me ever farther away from my only ally. The last thing I saw as we passed behind the blood altar was the second dandy sidling up to Casper in a coat the same orange as the sick sunset after a storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You seem rather familiar, my dear. Have we chanced to meet?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice was cultured, affected, and soft. I peered into his face as if trying to place him, and the waxed and curled tips of his mustache twitched. “I don’t believe so,” I said in the clipped accent of Sangland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ve been to the Sugar Snow Ball, surely.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is my first time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But that dress! Your seamstress is a treat. You must give me her address. In Muscovy, I suppose?” His eyes were quite large behind the slip of the mask, the black around them exaggerated. He was staring at me strangely, not as if I were a woman he found attractive, because that was impossible. And yet there was an odd, anxious hunger that I couldn’t place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You have been fooled, sir. It is secondhand, I am ashamed to say.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Is there a tag? A tailor’s mark? I simply must know. The beading is exquisite. It’s the very image of the debutante gown worn by dear, sweet Princess Ahnastasia, may Aztarte have mercy on her soul. Although the color is just a bit different.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mmm,” I murmured, nearly tripping over his exaggeratedly long shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where do you hail from, darling? Your accent is rather exotic.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Sangland. London.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Divine town. I dote upon it severely. Tell me, have you ever been to the opera there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Never.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis hand clenched ever so slightly on my waist, and he looked over my shoulder too quickly. I tried to follow his gaze, but he spun me into a crowd, and I couldn’t see back to where Casper had been, beside the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And is your mask from there as well?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A gift from my aunt, for the ball.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hiding so much.” The hand on my waist rose between us, the talon on his thumb raking my chin right under the mask. “Tell me, snowbird. Is your face as beautiful as your dress?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank heavens the Sugar Snow hadn’t started yet. My reaction would have plunged the country into anarchy. I jerked back from his claws and stumbled out of his arms, one hand holding the mask to my face before he could pry it off. His mouth curled up slowly, mimicking his mustache, and I spun away to shoulder through the other dancers and return to Casper. The space around the table was empty, with no sign of Casper or the other dandy. The Sugar Snow was close, and the air was tense and expectant, humming with magic. It was almost time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a silent hiss, I accepted a flute of champagne-infused blood from a waiting servant and held it up to my mask. I couldn’t get it down without making a mess of one sort or another, so I set it on the table and selected a chilled vial of blood slush from a waiting cauldron. Shaking with silent fury and fear, I tossed it back through the mouth hole of my mask as I sought Casper in the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I finally found him, the iced blood went heavy in my stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was dancing with Ravenna.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e38\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps Casper led the dance, but it was clear who was in power. They danced slowly, Ravenna’s mouth close enough to rip out his jugular as she whispered into his ear. They spun enough for me to see his face, and he was ashen, pale with barely restrained fury. The song ended, but she didn’t let go of the hand she had held while dancing. Instead, she dragged him toward the blud altar, and they stood before it together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“People of Freesia!” she shouted, and everyone crowded around. The scent of the coming Sugar Snow was heavy in the air, the moon obscured by misty clouds that swirled against the indigo like milk in blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My friends, I have great news. Our Sugar Snow is doubly blessed this year. We have with us the greatest musician in all of Sang. The Maestro himself, Casper Sterling!” Polite applause and whispering broke out, and Casper let out a great, shuddering breath. “He has been recently bludded, although he won’t reveal the circumstances. For once, an abomination is a welcome member of our ranks. My people, do we wish to hear the Snowsong played by the world’s most talented harpsichordist?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe applause after that was deafening. It had been a lean few years, and any advantage was welcome. One famous and talented man commanding the instrument he knew best was a better gamble than an entire orchestra when it came to flawless playing and timing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen again, no one had ever heard the Snowsong, aside from the Bludmen who came to this ball every year. It wasn’t written, it wasn’t public, and it was considered a great secret. How he was going to oblige Ravenna and her court without inciting tragedy was beyond me. At least, he had managed to avoid telling her about me; if she had known, I would have been in a fight for my life already. I focused on uncurling my claws and trying to appear as normal and innocent as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs I watched Ravenna lead Casper to the grand white harpsichord under the stairs, a cold hand grasped my wrist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“May I—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’ll sit this one out,” I hissed, trying to snatch my wrist back and failing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You won’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the dandy. Or dandies. One on either side of me. Their twin smiles, smug and sure, told me they knew more than I wanted them to. They each grasped one of my arms, and when I struggled, the one in violet produced a metal instrument like the one filled with seawater that had been carried by the assassin on the train.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s considered a patriotic duty to dance the Snowsong,” one said, and the other nodded and added, “Not dancing is often repaid with a good beheading.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI bared my teeth and felt the rush of the hunt flood my veins. I’d rip out their hearts and stomp on their fancy jackets if they didn’t loose my wrists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, I don’t think we want to behead this one, boys.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey spun me around, and I was face-to-face with my enemy at last. Ravenna grinned, a mad look in her dark eyes. My brother, Alex, was nowhere to be seen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took a deep breath and held her stare, my wrists caught by the dandies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nothing to say to your queen? Bow to me, then, little peacock.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe anger built inside me, but I was as still as a statue, as still as the blud altar, as still as the high white moon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer smile curled up, the bloodred lips mocking me. “Remove her mask.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the dandies untied the strings, and the proud peacock’s face shattered on the stone. The night air was cool and welcome on my heated skin, but Ravenna’s furious cackle of triumph stole the moment of relief. Her jugular pulsed as she threw back her head, and a rush of hunger and anger made me shiver. Nothing smelled so sweet as the enemy’s blud. With my wrists pinned, I was helpless to exact my revenge. But I was so close.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI sought Casper across the clearing and found him sitting at the harpsichord. For a fraction of a heartbeat, I smiled to know he was in the place he best belonged, but then reality crushed me again. One of the musicians was scribbling on a piece of paper, and Casper was miming notes on the harpsichord. Should he miss a note or time it wrong, it would mess up the dance, and the company would tear him limb from limb as a sacrifice to Aztarte. It was a clever gamble on Ravenna’s part, as if she had known that worry for Casper was the only thing that could leave me unbalanced. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wicked-as-she-wants-blud-2/page-56.html","bookId":1598,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:44:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:44:03 PM"}
