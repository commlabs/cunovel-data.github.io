The touch of the sun had left him weak, and he knew he had to feed, and soon. It was the only way to ease the pain burning through him, the only way to rejuvenate his seared flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe climbed carefully out of the box. Each movement brought torment; colorful curses hissed in six languages filled the air as he removed his singed clothing and changed into a pair of loose-fitting breeches and a shirt made of fine lawn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFeeling every one of his 379 years, he climbed slowly, painfully, up the cellar stairs to stand in the doorway, his head hanging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe hunger burned inside him, a relentless flame that would not be quenched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe donned a greatcoat, turned up the thick fur collar, and left the cottage. In his weakened state, it took him more than an hour to reach the city. And all the while the ravenous wolf of his hunger clawed his insides until he was nearly mad with it, and with the throbbing pain of his seared flesh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned down an alley reeking with filth, and waited...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe production was Sleeping Beauty, and Sara was dancing the role of Aurora.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sank back in his chair, his gaze fixed on Sara as she danced with the four princes, holding an exciting and delicate balance on one foot as she was passed from one suitor to the next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched with rapt attention during her solo, awed by her steps, which were light and quick, expressing her youth and joy, her hopes for the future. His throat convulsed as she pricked her finger on the spindle. It was only make-believe, but the thought of her blood, red and vital, made his mouth water as she collapsed into enchanted sleep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sat back, lost in his own thoughts, as the prince saw a vision of Aurora, but his full attention was aroused once more when the prince awakened Aurora with love\u0027s first kiss...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf only real life ended as happily as fairy tales, he mused ruefully. If only love\u0027s first kiss would restore him to the life he had lost...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHardly aware of what he was doing, he left the theater, his thoughts turned back 379 years. He had been born in a small village outside Vallelunga, Italy. His mother, who had given birth to ten children, had been old before her time. His father, too, had been worn out with the burden of providing for such a large family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel, who had been Giovanni Ognibene back then, had been the eldest son. He had hated the poverty in which they lived, hated the crowded house, the long hours in the fields, the constant struggle for survival. He had yearned for a different life, a better life, and the opportunity had come on a cool spring morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had agreed to gentle a headstrong young stallion for one of their neighbors and he had been hard at work when a portly, gray-haired man stopped to watch him. The man had been impressed with the way Gabriel handled the horse, so impressed he had offered Gabriel a job working in his stables. For Gabriel, it was the opportunity of a lifetime. Salvatore Musso was a wealthy man who owned a large villa in Vallelunga.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel had readily accepted the position. He had bade his parents a cheerful good-bye, promising to send money home and to visit often.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had worked hard during the next six months, earning Musso\u0027s respect, making friends with the man\u0027s son, Giuseppe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been sixteen when he received word that his parents were ill. He had left for home immediately, but it had been too late. A mysterious fever had swept through the village, and he had watched his family die, one by one. First his mother, then his sisters, his brothers, and finally his father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly then, when all those he loved were dead, had he realized how much he had loved them. Deep inside, he had felt as if their deaths had been his fault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the urging of the village priest, Giuseppe\u0027s parents had taken Gabriel into their home. At first, mourning the loss of his family, he had kept to himself, but as time passed, he discovered a whole new world, a world of wealth and aristocracy, a world where people never went to bed hungry, where servants did the work, where everyone dressed in fine clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a world he had never seen before, a world he wanted for his own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiuseppe\u0027s parents had been most generous. They had fed him and clothed him, but fine clothes could not disguise Giovanni\u0027s lack of social grace. Still, he had tried hard and learned quickly, and he\u0027d had one thing in his favor: he was young and handsome and the women adored him. They were willing to make allowances for his cloddish manners, willing to teach him the dances of the day, to instruct him in etiquette and proper decorum. He had quickly learned the polite phrases, the art of dancing and fencing, the proper way to sit a horse, to greet royalty. But always, in the back of his mind, had been the knowledge that he was only pretending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been nine and twenty when he accompanied Giuseppe to Venice. It had been a time of laughter, of parties that seemed never-ending. It was there he had met Antonina Insenna. She had beguiled him from the start, and he had quickly fallen prey to her dark beauty. She had been a woman of untold wealth and power. To others she had appeared coolly self-assured, aloof, but for Giovanni she had smiled, and when she smiled, he was lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNina had been everything he had thought he wanted in a woman: beautiful, desirable, mysterious. The fact that she was older than he only added to her mystique, as did her refusal to see him during the day, and though they had spent every evening together, she had refused to let him stay the night. And because he had thought himself in love, because she had been a woman of the world, full of fire and mystery, he had seen only what he wanted to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, on an afternoon in later summer, he had met Rosalia Baglio, a young woman of quiet, incomparable beauty. He had been smitten with her from the first, and she with him. He knew then that what he had felt for Antonina was not love, but lust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe began to avoid Nina\u0027s company, preferring to spend all his time with Rosalia. They had met openly and in secret, pledging their love and devotion, even though he had feared she could never be his. Rosalia came from a wealthy family, while he had no money of his own, no lands, no title.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt had been inevitable that Antonina should discover that he had left her for another woman. Her wrath had been terrible to see. She had threatened to tell Rosalia of their affair, threatened to kill him, to kill Rosalia in front of his very eyes, but in the end she had done none of those things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will regret this, Gianni,\" she had told him on what he had thought would be their last night together. \"The time will come when you will beg me for that which only I can give, and the price will be dear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had not believed her. And then, after a wild night of carousing and drinking with Giuseppe and a few friends, he had taken sick with a fever. Giuseppe\u0027s parents had summoned the physicians. They had bled him to exorcise the bad humors from his body. They had forced vile concoctions down his throat, but to no avail. Two days later, the doctors went away, shaking their heads, and he had known he was going to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been trying to accept the fact that his life was over before it had begun when Antonina appeared in his room as if by magic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can help you, Giovanni,\" she had promised in her soft, silky voice. \"Only say you will be mine for one night, and all will be well. I will restore your health, Gianni, and give you riches beyond your wildest dreams.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Too late,\" he had moaned, the fear of dying rising up within him. \"Too late.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not too late, cara mio,\" she had said. \"Only give me your promise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd because he had been in excruciating pain, because he had been terrified of dying, because he had wanted so very badly to marry Rosalia, he had agreed to do whatever Antonina wished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as he had given Antonina his vow, a change had come over her. All softness seemed to vanish from her face, and her eyes had glowed with a fierce and terrible light.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had sat down beside him on the bed and drawn him into her embrace and kissed him. Her lips had been as cold as the grave, and when he tried to pull away, her arms had tightened around him and she had laughed softly, a dry sound, like old bones rattling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFear had shot through him and he had struggled harder to escape her, but in vain. His strength was as nothing compared to hers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith ease, she had held him down, her body covering his as she kissed his eyelids, his cheek, his mouth, her lips gradually burning a path to the side of his neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had gasped when he felt her teeth prick the skin, the sensation one of mingled pain and sensual pleasure. And then he had felt himself drowning, suffocating in darkness and fear. Her skin had grown warmer as his own grew cold, and he had known he was on the brink of death. His heartbeat had slowed, his breathing had grown shallow and labored, and he had been swallowed up in darkness, smothered in terror unlike anything he had ever known or imagined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had looked at her blankly, not comprehending, as she bit her own wrist and pressed it to his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if from far away, he had heard her voice. \"Drink, Giovanni.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had been too weak to resist when she pressed her bleeding wrist to his mouth. \"Drink, Giovanni,\" she had urged. Again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had obeyed because he lacked the will to do otherwise. And like a river at flood tide, life had flowed back into him, filling him. He had closed his eyes, moaning with pleasure as he drank and drank and drank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she took her wrist from his mouth, he had opened his eyes, intending to ask for more. But then he had seen Antonina hovering over him, her lips stained with blood, and he had known it was his blood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had stared at her in horror. \"What have you done?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had smiled at him, and he had seen her teeth, the canines long and sharp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have fulfilled my promise,\" she said. \"I have restored your health, and given you wealth and power. You are now immortal, Giovanni Ognibene, and with immortality comes power, and the ability to gather the wealth of the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRising, she had pulled a white silk handkerchief from her pocket and delicately wiped the blood, his blood, from her lips. He had shuddered with revulsion when she used that same handkerchief to wipe her blood from his mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had remained at his side while his body sloughed off the last of his humanity. His senses, now sharper than before, were bewildering, frightening. Colors had been brighter, the candlelight had hurt his eyes, the slightest sound had bruised his ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had told him, in a voice devoid of emotion, that he must have blood to live, that food would sicken him, but he had refused to believe her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith amusement, she had left the room, returning a short time later with a handful of succulent grapes. To prove her wrong, he had eaten them all. A moment later, pain had knifed through him and he had dropped to his knees, his stomach retching violently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s almost dawn,\" she had said, her gaze darting to the window and back. \"You can sleep with me today. Tomorrow night, you will fulfill your promise, and then you must find a place to rest. You must line your bed with the earth of your homeland, should you ever decide to leave Italy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had stared at her, uncomprehending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are a creature of the night now,\" Antonina had explained. \"You cannot die. Exposure to the sun will kill you. Holy water will burn your flesh. You cannot procreate, but you will live forever.\" She paused, her hand on a small wooden chest. \"I promised you wealth, Giovanni, and here it is. Use it wisely.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo nights later, frightened and confused, he had gone to Rosalia and told her everything. Looking back, he wondered why he had been so thoroughly unprepared for the stark expression of revulsion that rose in her eyes, for the terror that had sent her stumbling away from him. He could still hear her screams as she fell down the winding staircase to land with a sickening thud on the floor below. He had known even before he reached her side that she was dead. He had left Italy the next night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had thought it would be an easy thing, living by night and sleeping by day. He had assumed he would be able to walk among mortals, to dance and laugh and make love as before, but it was not to be. The hunger, new and untamed, roared to life whenever he allowed himself to mingle with humanity. In the beginning, unable to help himself, he had satisfied his thirst nightly, often at the expense of some poor mortal\u0027s life. Only after many decades had he learned to control his beastly appetite, to take a few drops instead of a life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had learned, to his dismay, that while he looked human, he was an outcast, a creature who would never again belong to the family of mankind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had learned, over the centuries, what true loneliness was...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now he stood in the shadows of the cafe, watching Sara. Dressed in a gown of palest pink, she looked as fresh and natural as a wild rose. Her young man sat beside her, his hand holding hers, his gaze rapt upon her face, and who could blame him? She was a vision, an angel, fair of face and form, with a laugh as soft as a sigh, and a smile more radiant than the sun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnvy rose within Gabriel, and his hands clenched into fists. It took every ounce of his self-control to keep from crossing the room and breaking the young man\u0027s neck. One quick twist would do it. Just one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara, my sweet Sara, why did I ever let you go?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up then, her head turning in his direction, her gaze probing the shadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad she heard his thoughts? Did she know he was there? But that was impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd yet she was rising, walking away from the table. He stood in the shadowed corner, his body trembling as she drew near. He could feel her gaze searching the darkness. But for the terrible weakness that plagued him, he would have dissolved into mist and disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gabriel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gabriel! Is it you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t come any closer, Sara.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stopped, confused. \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go away.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe licked her lips nervously, wishing she could see him more clearly, but he seemed one with the shadows. \"I\u0027ll go,\" she said, \"but only if you promise to come to me later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I cannot.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve missed you, Gabriel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" She took a step forward. \"You\u0027re in pain, aren\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know that?\" he asked sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I felt it when it happened. I feel it now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go, Sara, please go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll come to me later tonight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" The word was torn from his lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo hours later, he knocked at the door of her apartment. Like a callow youth courting his first girl, he stood in the shadows, uncertain and a little afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe heard Sara\u0027s voice telling someone named Babette she was dismissed for the night. A moment later, Sara opened the door, and he was overcome with a rush of wild emotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gabriel! I\u0027m so glad to see you. Come in, come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The lights,\" he said, hugging the shadows. \"Put out the lights.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned at him a moment, then went to do as bidden. Only then did he enter the room, quietly closing the door behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a moment, he stood there, guilt rising up to meet him. She had no idea what she had invited into her home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gabriel?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How are you, Sara?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine. And you?\" He heard the underlying note of concern in her voice. \"Won\u0027t you sit down?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a nod, he sat down on the damask-covered settee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can I take your cloak?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shook his head, retreating into the concealing folds of the hooded garment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stood in front of the sofa, her hands toying with the wide blue sash of her dress. \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here. I\u0027ve missed you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were wonderful tonight,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flushed with pleasure. \"You were there, at the opera house?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Indeed. I\u0027ve never seen anything more beautiful, cara. Truly, you were born to dance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do love it so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe took a deep breath, his hands clenching beneath the voluminous folds of his cloak.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And the young man who was with you at the cafe? Do you also love him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maurice?\" She laughed softly. \"He is just a friend.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But he would like to be more?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you love him?\" The words were harsher this time, demanding an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Perhaps, a little.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has he asked you to marry him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t answer immediately. He could hear the sudden, nervous hammering of her heart, hear the blood rushing through her veins, heating her cheeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Has he?\" Gabriel prompted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. He said we should marry and start our own ballet company.\" The thought made her smile. \"He said we would tour the world.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe felt the rage building within him as he imagined her married to her young man, walking with him in the sunlight, giving him children...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSummoning centuries of self-control, he fought down the urge to strike out. He had no right to intrude in her life, no right at all. Maurice was the kind of man she deserved. Young, handsome, ambitious. Someone who shared her love of the dance, someone who could share the days and nights of her life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone mortal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wanted to kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you wish to marry him, I shall see that you\u0027re well taken care of. I have a rather large apartment in Marseilles. It shall be yours on the day you wed, as well as a generous monthly allowance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I couldn\u0027t - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up a hand, silencing her arguments. \"You have no parents to provide for you, and I would not see you totally dependent on whoever you decide to wed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHurt and confused because he seemed anxious to see her wed to another, Sara took a step forward, then sat down on the opposite end of the settee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that why you came here, to marry me off to someone else?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do you mean?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe lowered her gaze. \"I\u0027ve never stopped thinking of you, Gabriel. Every night, I hoped you would come to see me, that you were missing me, longing for me, as I have been longing for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at him, her gaze quietly pleading. \"I know you thought I was just a child, that I was too young to know my own mind, my own heart, but I love you, Gabriel. I loved you then, and I love you now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why? Why can\u0027t I love you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe reached out to him, and he jerked away. The movement dislodged the hood, allowing her to see his face for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Gabriel! What has happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nothing,\" he said, replacing the hood. \"An accident.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore he could stop her, she sprang to her feet and lit the lamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" He covered his face with his hands, only then realizing what a mistake it had been to come here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cowered before her as she lowered the hood, then pulled his hands away so she could see his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Gabriel,\" she murmured, her throat constricting with horror. \"My poor angel.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe turned away, not wanting her to see the ruin of his face, not wanting to see the pity he knew would be reflected in her eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA low groan, half pleasure, half pain, rumbled in his throat as Sara drew him into her arms, rocking him gently, as a mother would comfort a wounded child.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me what happened,\" she urged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was burned...\" His voice was low, muffled against her breasts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Burned!\" A vivid image of the fire at the orphanage flashed through her mind, and with it, the memory of pain, horrible, excruciating pain. \"Oh, Gabriel,\" she murmured, \"I thought it was only a dream.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A dream? What are you saying?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dreamed of you, dreamed that you had been badly hurt. It was so real. I felt the heat burn my skin...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was examining his hands and arms as she spoke, her eyes filling with tears as she saw his burned flesh. \"How did it happen?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe closed his eyes for a moment, her touch soothing him as nothing else could. \"It doesn\u0027t matter. I was careless. It\u0027s not as bad as it looks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Does it hurt dreadfully?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara drew him into her arms again as if she knew that her touch brought him solace. \"How long will you be here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I... I don\u0027t know.\" He had planned to see her dance, to assure himself that she was well and happy, and then leave. But now... how could he leave her now? Her very nearness was like a soothing balm to his troubled soul; her touch brought surcease from the pain of his wounds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stay,\" she entreated. \"Please stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t want to complicate your life.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How could you do that? You\u0027re my guardian angel, remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I remember, cara.\" With an effort, he withdrew from her arms. \"I must go now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ll come tomorrow night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you wish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do, very much. Will you meet me outside the opera house? We could go to dinner.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. I shall come to you here. At midnight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rose with him, her eyes shining with happiness because she would see him again. \"You won\u0027t change your mind?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, but your maid, Babette, must not be here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSara nodded. She supposed it was natural that he wouldn\u0027t want anyone else to see him. \"Won\u0027t you... will you... ?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabriel frowned at her. \"What is it you wish, cara? You have only to name it, and it\u0027s yours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Won\u0027t you kiss me good night?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe nodded slightly, intending to do no more than brush his lips across hers. As if suspecting as much, she stood on her tiptoes, her hands gently cupping his ravaged face as she pressed her mouth to his.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLight exploded through him, brighter than the glow of a thousand candles. It flowed through him, clean and pure, filling his mind with images of warm summer days and sun-kissed mornings bright with dew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStunned, he stumbled backward, and after murmuring a hasty farewell, he took his leave before she could see the blood-stained tears that dampened his cheeks, before he fell to his knees at her feet and begged her to see past the monster he had become and love the man who no longer existed. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/embrace-the-night/page-12.html","bookId":2307,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:00 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:14:00 PM"}
