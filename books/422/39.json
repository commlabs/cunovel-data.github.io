How Dietrich’s Men were all slain","content":"\u0026nbsp;So measureless-wide the wailing swelled in that dolorous hour, \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n That with cries of lamentation re-echoed palace and tower;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the tumult was heard by a warrior of Bern, who was Dietrich’s man,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And bearing the heavy tidings to his lord in haste he ran.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He spake to the princely hero: “Lord Dietrich, hearken my tale:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Through all the years of my life-tide such agony of wail\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Never I heard upshrieking, as that I have hearkened but now.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The King himself, even Etzel, hath come unto scathe, I trow.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For what cause else should the people with one voice all make dole?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of the twain one, Etzel or Kriemhild, is no more a living soul.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By the wrath of the dauntless strangers have they slept the iron sleep,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And countless knightly heroes in measureless anguish weep.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But the Lord of Bern made answer: “True liegemen mine, beware\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lest in judging ye be o’er-hasty: what desperate deed soe’er\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Hath been done by the homeless heroes, sore need constraineth their will.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n My peace with them I plighted—let this advantage them still.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then out spake Wolfhart the dreadless: “Lo, I will hence to the hall:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I will ask of sorrow her story, what woe hath chanced to befall,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And to thee will I bring the tidings, O well-belovèd chief,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So soon as I learn what meaneth that voice of a people’s grief,”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Spake Dietrich the noble: “When heroes in each face look for a foe,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And one cometh with rough sharp questions, where a word is like a blow,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then all too quickly enkindled their smouldering anger is:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Therefore I will not, Wolfhart, that thou question touching this.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then he commanded Helfric to go swift-hastening,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he bade him ask of the matter from the folk of Etzel the King,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 307}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Or, as it might be, from the strangers, what hap had befallen there;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For never had such lamentation of a multitude thrilled the air.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n So the messenger came, and he questioned: “What thing hath chanced this day?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And a woeful voice made answer: “All joy hath fled away,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, the last that was yet remaining to the Hunfolk’s stricken land!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Here lieth Rüdiger, slaughtered by some Burgundian hand;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Not one of his liegemen liveth, that with him went into the fight.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Never could woefuller tidings on the ears of Helfrich smite;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Never so loth in spirit a tale to his lord he bore;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he came back unto Dietrich weeping and mourning sore.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “What hast thou learnt?—thy tidings?” Dietrich spake forthright.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Why weepest thou so sorely, O Helfrich, my good knight?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Good cause have I for lamenting,” answered the noble thane:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The good Lord Rüdiger lieth by hands Burgundian slain!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Cried the Hero of Bern: “Forbid it, God, that this should be!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n This were a ghastly vengeance, ’twere the Fiend’s arch-mockery!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Rüdiger?—how should he ever such evil requital have earned?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n True friend to the homeless strangers was he, long since I learned.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Cried Wolfhart the lion-hearted: “If the righteous blood they have shed,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n All these shall dearly abye it! Their lives be forfeited!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n If we should endure such outrage, our shame and reproach it were!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n How oft hath it rendered us service, the hand of Rüdiger!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The Prince of the Amal people bade them inquire yet more.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He sat him down at a casement: heavy his heart was and sore.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Old Hildebrand he commanded to the warrior guests to speed,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And to hear from their lips the story of this most evil deed.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The good knight battle-fearless, old Master Hildebrand,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Took neither sword nor buckler; all weaponless was his hand:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He purposed to go to the strangers in knightly courtesy;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Thereat the son of his sister chode with him angerly.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 308}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Spake the grim warrior Wolfhart: “And goest thou fenceless there?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then flout and scoff for answer, be sure, they will not spare;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And so, like a hound well beaten, with shame wilt thou turn again!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But go, like a man, war-harnessed, and their malapert tongues will they rein.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Thereat did the old knight arm him, after the young man’s rede;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And, or ever Hildebrand knew it, stood all in battle-weed\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The eager warriors of Dietrich: sword in hand stood they.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the hero was grieved, and had turned them, an he might, from their purposed way.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Whither away?” he asked them. “Thither will we with thee;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And haply Hagen of Troneg less eager then shall be\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With jeering speech to mock thee, as his cruel wont is still.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the hero hearkened and answered, “Be it then as ye will.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then looked forth Volker the valiant, and the knights of Bern he saw,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The liegemen of Lord Dietrich, full-harnessed thitherward draw,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Girded about with war-glaives, with bucklers gripped in hand;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And he told it unto his masters, the Lords of Burgundia-land;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And spake the viol-minstrel: “Yonder I see draw near\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The vassal-throng of Dietrich, like foes in battle-gear\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Harnessed, and under helmet, as who would beset us in fight.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I ween we homeless heroes shall now be in evil plight.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Even as he spake his warning, thither came Hildebrand;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And there, with his great shield planted on the earth at his feet, did he stand;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And cried to the men of Gunther that sorrow-stricken one:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Ah, noble knights, what evil unto you had Rüdiger done?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Me hath my good lord Dietrich unto you sent hitherward\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n To wot if a hand Burgundian it was that slew with the sword\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The noble Lord of the Marches, as the tale unto us was told;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For then should our weeping be endless, our grief aye unconsoled.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Made answer Hagen of Troneg: “That tale is all too true.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Right glad were I had the teller thereof but lied unto you\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 309}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n For Rüdiger’s sake, that the hero might live to gladden our eyes—\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He for whom wailing of women and men evermore shall rise.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When they heard those heavy tidings that their friend was dead in truth,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Loud mourned the loyal-hearted, the good knights wept for ruth;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The tears ran down the faces of Dietrich’s valiant men,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And the drops on the beards of them glistened: sore grief was their portion then.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Siegstab the Bernese war-duke lamented over his friend:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Woe’s me for the lovingkindness that here hath found an end,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The kindness that Rüdiger showed us in the days of our exile-pain!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The comfort of all the homeless lieth by you knights slain!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then did a man of the Amals, the war-thane Wolfwein, cry:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Though I saw my very father here dead before me lie,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I were not more sorrow-stricken than for Rüdiger laid low.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Alas! who now shall comfort the Margravine in her woe?”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In wrathful indignation Wolfhart the dauntless cried:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Who now shall lead the heroes, on the war-path when they ride,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As our knights have been led of the Margrave many a time ere now?\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Woe, Rüdiger most noble, lost unto us art thou!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Wolfbrand the strong and Helfrich, and Helmnot the thane withal,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With all their friends and kinsmen, wept for Rüdiger’s fall.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n No further could Hildebrand question for sighing, but spake one word:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Now grant to us that, O heroes, for the which we were sent of our lord.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Give forth of the hall the body unto us of the noble dead,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In whom is our sunny joyance into night of mourning fled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Let our last sad service requite him for all that to us he hath done\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In kindness passing loyal, and to many a homeless one.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n We be here in a strange land strangers like Rüdiger the knight...\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Why keep ye us here waiting? Let us bear him hence forthright,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And render the perished hero such honour as we may,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Such as we gladly had rendered, were he alive this day.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Answered and spake King Gunther: “No service is worthier praise\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Than that to a dead friend rendered by his friends of the olden days;\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 310}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Yea, when in your power it lieth, that call I friendship true.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n It is meet ye should do him service for the love he hath shown unto you.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Words, words!—how long must we pray you?” cried Wolfhart with passionate breath.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “There lieth our chiefest comfort, by your hands done to death!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n And we to our sorrow no longer may have our friend in our sight.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Let us bear him hence from his slayers, and lay in the grave forthright!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Volker flung back his answer: “None giveth him up at thine hest!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He is here—e’en take him from us! The noblest knight and the best\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lieth amidst of a blood-pool with death-wounds stricken down.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Unto Rüdiger do this service: it shall be your friendship’s crown!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Made answer Wolfhart the dreadless: “God knows, thou master of song,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Thou hast little to do to provoke us! Ye have done us enow of wrong!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But that awe of my lord constrains me, thou wert in sorry plight!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But now must we brook thine insults, since he hath forbidden the fight.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then sneered the viol-minstrel: “Who goeth in timorous doubt\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Lest he haply transgress a commandment, shall brook full many a flout.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Small share of the spirit of heroes I find in a mood so mild!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n At the biting speech of his comrade Hagen grimly smiled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Thou shalt lack not proof of my spirit!” hotly Wolfhart cried.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I will jangle thy viol-music so, that if ever thou ride\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Homeward hence to the Rhineland, thou shalt croak a new song there!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Thy malapert tongue, thou scorner, with honour I may not bear!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Answered the viol-minstrel: “An thou mar one faintest tone\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Of the strings of my good viol, the sheen of thy morion\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Shall be grievously dimmed and sullied with thy blood by my right hand,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Howsoever it fall with my riding back to Burgundia-land.”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then Wolfhart had leapt on the minstrel, but in mid rush was he held,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n By the giant strength of his uncle, old Hildebrand, compelled.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n {p. 311}\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “I see thou wouldst play the madman in thy foolish wrath!” did he cry.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “The favour of our Lord Dietrich thou wilt forfeit utterly!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Let loose thy lion, O keeper, so fiercely he chafes at the chain!\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But and if to mine hands he cometh,” cried Volker the mighty thane,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n “Although his wondrous prowess had smitten the whole world dead,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n I will slay him: no more hot answers from that mad tongue shall be sped!”\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n In the eyes of the Bernese warriors blazed the onset’s light:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Upswung his buckler Wolfhart, that battle-eager knight:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n With the leap of a desert lion against that taunter he leapt:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Like a torrent up to the stairway his friends behind him swept.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n But with what great leaps soever to the door of the hall he sped,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Old Hildebrand before him sprang to the stairway-head:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He would suffer none to outpace him, nor to plunge mid the war-surge first\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ready the stern guests waited to quench their battle-thirst.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Full upon Hagen rushed he, old Master Hildebrand,\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Loud rang the swords fierce-smiting in either
