The Will of millions of cultivators was being drawn upon to create a tempest of the most shocking proportions!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFrom a distance, it looked like the sky might be ripped apart! Celestial Virūpākṣa moved with shocking speed, becoming vaster than the sky itself as he unleashed his crushing attack!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCelestial Ren Ling was a bit weaker than him, but the murderous aura that roiled around her actually surpassed his! In terms of both brutality and number of kills, few celestials in the Vile-Emperor Dynasty could surpass her!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eWith the two of them attacking in unison, it seemed like a devastating force that would absolutely crush anything in their path with utter impunity!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003ePeople in Megarock City were already cheering in excitement.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Two celestials are attacking at once! This King Heavenspan is dead for sure!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Hahaha! One measly celestial from the Heavenspan Realm can’t possibly be a match for two of our Vile-Emperor celestials. In fact, was it really necessary to send two?!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah, Celestial Virūpākṣa alone could have sent Bai Xiaochun fleeing like the rat he is!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe people in the city weren’t the only ones to feel that way. The numerous other cultivators who had rushed over to see the action were equally excited. They were absolutely convinced that, no matter how strong Bai Xiaochun might be, he was nothing but a foreigner, and couldn’t possibly stand up to this attack, not unless he was an archaean with battle prowess to crush everything in his path.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“How arrogant, Bai Xiaochun! You’re \u003cem\u003edead\u003c/em\u003e this time!!” Such talk could be heard everywhere, along with sarcastic laughter.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs for the scattered Heavenspan Realm cultivators present, they were anxious beyond measure, and yet, were completely helpless. All they could do was fearfully watch Virūpākṣa and Ren Ling closing in on Bai Xiaochun.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBai Xiaochun didn’t seem to notice what people were saying, or at least, he didn’t care. In fact, his smile grew even colder. They viewed him as a foreigner, but to him… \u003cem\u003ethey\u003c/em\u003e were the foreigners.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“In that case… it will be in your moment of greatest conceit that I push you to the depths of despair!” Eyes narrowed, he looked at the incoming celestials. Not bothering to rise to his feet, he waved his hand, placing a faint scrap of sovereign-level aura into his hand as he launched a fist strike!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t even use the full and complete Undying Sovereign’s Fist, only a portion of it. But even still, heaven and earth rumbled loudly as the air in front of him shattered. Then, a sound that surpassed heavenly thunder exploded out, completely drowning out the sound of the cheering crowd.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the air continued to shatter, heading directly toward Celestial Virūpākṣa and Ren Ling, overwhelming them!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt was a force backed by Bai Xiaochun’s cultivation base, fleshly body power, and a scrap of a sovereign’s aura. It might not faze an archaean, but to a celestial… it was a catastrophic blow that simply couldn’t be defended against!!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCelestial Virūpākṣa’s eyes went wide; despite the level of his cultivation base, and his self-control, he immediately blurted, “Imposs… impossible!!”\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHis mind spun in unprecedented fashion, and yet, there was no time for thought or consideration. Feeling a greater sense of impending crisis than he had ever felt in his life, he let out a frenzied shout, blue veins bulging out on his face and neck as he made the decision not to back up!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe knew that if he did, he would be killed beyond the shadow of a doubt!!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eOf course, the power Bai Xiaochun had put into the fist strike was of secondary importance. The most important factor was the aura. It was sharp, sharper than the sharpest sword, and as such, it was like a blade slashing into a piece of wood, or even paper!!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCelestial Virūpākṣa howled at the top of his lungs. Not even thinking about Bai Xiaochun anymore, he used all of his cultivation base, and all of his divine abilities. He even produced ten precious treasures, trump cards that weren’t quite on the level of world treasures, but were defensive magical items of incredible value!!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCelestial Ren Ling was a bit slower to react, and was not as well prepared as Virūpākṣa. Therefore, she chose to retreat!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThey made different decisions, and therefore… the results were vastly different!!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eRumbling sounds echoed out as the air shattered, creating what looked like a huge mouth that chomped down onto the two celestials!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAn agonized shriek and a miserable scream echoed out. As for Celestial Virūpākṣa, his more than ten precious treasures were incapable of standing up to the energy, and shattered as quickly as dried twigs!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHis divine abilities, magical techniques, and defensive measures began to fall apart, allowing the massive force to pierce through toward him. However, all of the measures he had taken were not in vain. Because Bai Xiaochun had not used much of his sovereign aura, Celestial Virūpākṣa was flung backward, his chest caved in, and massive amounts of blood pouring out of his mouth. And yet… he escaped with his life!!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately… Celestial Ren Ling, despite having chosen to flee, had not come fully prepared with defensive items. It was an error in judgement that resulted… in her fleshly body being ripped to shreds and destroyed!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAs for her Daoseed, it was swept up by the shattered air, and although it wasn’t wiped out of existence, cracking sounds emanated out from it, along with a bloodcurdling scream. Normally speaking, a Daoseed could only be destroyed by an archaean, but right now… seven eye-catching cracks were visible on the surface of Ren Ling’s Daoseed!!!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eUsually, such cracks would only appear if a celestial had been resurrected, and would indicate a significant level of weakness…. As such, if Ren Ling were to be resurrected again, then her celestial cultivation base would be weakened to the point where she would be lucky to even be considered a celestial!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAll of this takes a bit of time to describe, but actually happened in the time it takes a spark to fly off of a piece of flint. It happened so quickly that no one had time to think or react. It was as if an enormous palm had just slapped all of the cultivators of the Vile-Emperor Dynasty directly across the face!!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eCelestial Virūpākṣa and Celestial Ren Ling had been bearing down on Bai Xiaochun with raging energy and boundless murderous auras. And yet… Bai Xiaochun dispatched them without even standing up!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe unleashed a fist strike that shattered the air, seriously wounded Celestial Virūpākṣa, and most terrifying of all… killed a celestial! Up to this point in history, it had only ever been possible for an archaean to destroy a celestial’s Daoseed in battle.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat was one reason why celestials didn’t truly fear dying in combat!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut now… everything had changed!!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eMillions of cultivators were present to bear witness to the fact that… there was a third person in the Eternal Immortal Domains who could kill celestials!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe significance of that fact, and the terrifying battle prowess Bai Xiaochun had just demonstrated, caused many people to gulp in terror. Most of them were completely dumbstruck, to the point where no one reacted for a protracted moment!\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Heavens! This is impossible!!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“How could this be happening? What… what kind of cultivation base does he have?!?!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“He… can kill celestials?!?! He actually killed her, wiped her out of existence…?”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAmidst the terrified uproar, Celestial Virūpākṣa, who had just escaped with his life, looked over at Bai Xiaochun with disbelief and horror.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“You….”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut Bai Xiaochun wasn’t even looking at Virūpākṣa. Rising to his feet atop the stone pagoda, he looked up into the sky.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e“Since you’ve come all this way, Vile-Emperor, there’s no need to skulk in the shadows. I hereby challenge you to a duel!”\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1203\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1205\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Next Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/a-will-eternal/awe-chapter-1204","bookId":1496,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:11 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 2:52:11 AM"}
