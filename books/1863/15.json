{"id":82096,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"\u003cp\u003eJez recognized them immediately-not the individuals, but the type. They were \u0027wolves, and they were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethugs. Somebody\u0027s hired muscle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t have her stick, but she didn\u0027t need it. She could feel a dangerous smile come to her lips; part\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanticipation and part sheer fury. Suddenly she wasn\u0027t tired, wasn\u0027t sore, wasn\u0027t anything but perfectly in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etune with her body and dying to use it as a weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe launched herself like a streak of red lightning, passing Claire easily and knocking the human girl flat\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebefore landing in front of the \u0027wolves. A guy and a girl. They snapped to attention in front of her, each\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edropping into a fighting stance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBehind her, she could hear Claire say, \"Ow.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good morning and welcome to the Bay Area,\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez told the \u0027wolves; then she snap-kicked the girl in the face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl flew backward. She wasn\u0027t out of commission, but it had wrecked the joint attack they had been\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabout to make. The guy knew this, but he was a wolf, so instead of waiting for his partner to recover, he\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003egrowled and threw himself at Jez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, Goddess, this is too easy. As he drove a punch at her face, Jez turned sideways and let his fist\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhistle past her. Then she threw her left arm \"* around his left hip, holding him in what was almost an\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eembrace. A deadly one, though. At the same instant she slammed her left hand up to his chin, striking\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith enough force to stun him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe staggered in her arms, snarling. Bristly hairs erupted on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sweet dreams, Fido,\" Jez said. She hooked her left leg around his right just below the knee and brought\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehim crashing to the platform. His head hit the concrete and he went limp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomewhere behind Jez, a sort of thin shrieking had begun. Claire. Jez ignored it, and ignored the two or\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethree people scrambling for the stairs- avoiding the down escalator because it was right beside Jez. She\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas focused on the female werewolf, who was back on her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do yourself a favor and don\u0027t even try anything,\" she said, grinning. \"You\u0027re way outclassed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl, who had reddish-brown hair and a feral expression, didn\u0027t answer. She simply showed her teeth\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eand lunged for Jez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith both hands reaching for Jez\u0027s face. You\u0027d think they would learn, Jez. thought. Especially after what\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejust happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as she was thinking it, her body was making the right moves. She grabbed the girl\u0027s leading arm\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewith both hands, then twisted, pulling her off balance. She took the girl down with a pull drop, flipping her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto the platform. As soon as the girl was flat Jez locked the arm she still held and began to apply leverage\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eagainst the elbow joint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t move or I\u0027ll break your elbow,\" she said pleasantly. The girl was writhing in pain, spitting and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estruggling and hurting herself worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbsently, Jez noticed that Claire had stopped shrieking. She glanced up to make sure her cousin was all\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eright and saw that Claire was on her feet, staring openmouthed. Jez gave her a reassuring nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she looked back at the female \u0027wolf. Now that the fight was over she had the leisure to wonder\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewhat was going on. There were plenty of people who might want to kill her, but she couldn\u0027t think of any\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ereason for them to target Claire. And they had been targeting her; Jez was sure of that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was no random thing. This was two \u0027wolves attacking a human right in public, in front of witnesses,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eas if they didn\u0027t care who saw them. This was something planned, something important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe gave the girl\u0027s arm a little twist, and the girl snarled wildly, glaring at Jez with reddish eyes full of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eanimal fury and hatred.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, you know what I want,\" Jez said. \u0027I need answers, and I don\u0027t have much time. What are you\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edoing here? Who sent you? And why do you want her?\" She jerked her head toward Claire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe girl just glared harder. Jez applied more pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look, I can make time for this if I need to. I can do this all day. After I break this elbow I\u0027ll do the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eother one. And then I\u0027ll break your ribs, and then your kneecaps-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Filthy halfbreed scum,\" the werewolf snarled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez\u0027s heart gave an odd lurch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tried to quiet it Well, now, that was interesting. Somebody obviously knew her secret. And since\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethey\u0027d been going for Claire, they knew Claire was connected with her....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey knew about her family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez saw white light. She threw sudden pressure against the \u0027wolfs elbow joint. The girl screamed, a\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esound more of anger than of pain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who hired you?\" Jez said softly, each word coming out like a chip of ice. \"Who sent you after my\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecousin?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe stared into the reddish eyes, trying to reach into the girl\u0027s soul and yank an answer out of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Nobody messes with my family,\" she whispered. \"Whoever sent you is going to be sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe couldn\u0027t ever remember feeling so angry. And she was so focused on the girl, so intent, that it wasn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003euntil Claire screamed that she realized someone was approaching behind her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jez, watch out!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe yell woke Jez up. Without releasing her hold on the female \u0027wolf, she turned around-just in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etime to see a male vampire stalking her. He must have come up the down escalator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd behind him, unbelievably, was Claire, running and getting ready for a flying tackle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Claire, don\u0027t!\" Jez yelled. She struck the female \u0027wolf once, with deadly accuracy, on the side of the jaw\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto knock her out. Then she sprang toward the vampire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Claire was already grabbing him-a completely futile and foolish gesture. He whipped around and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eseized a handful of dark hair, and then he was holding Claire in a choke hold, putting her body between\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehim and Jez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One more step and I\u0027ll break her neck,\" he warned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez skidded to a stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You let go of my cousin,\" she spat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I really think we need to talk first,\" he said, the beginnings of an ugly grin on his face. \"You\u0027re the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eone who\u0027s going to give answers-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez kicked him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA roundhouse kick to his knees while he was busy talking. She didn\u0027t worry about keeping it nonlethal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe only cared about breaking his hold on Claire.-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt worked. He lost his grip, stumbling sideways. Jez grabbed Claire and thrust her out of the way,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshouting \"Run! The escalator\u0027s right there!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Claire didn\u0027t run. \"I want to help you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Idiot!\" Jez didn\u0027t have time to say that Claire couldn\u0027t help her; could only hurt her. The vampire\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehad recovered and was moving toward her in fighting position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was big, probably over two hundred pounds. And he was a full vampire, which gave him the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eadvantage of strength and speed. And he was smarter than the \u0027wolves; he wasn\u0027t just going to lunge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Jez didn\u0027t have a weapon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just keep behind me, okay?\" she snarled under her breath to Claire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampire grinned at that. He knew Jez was vulnerable. She was going to have to keep half her\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eattention on protecting Claire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, just as he was about to make an attack, Jez heard the smack of footsteps on concrete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRunning footsteps, with a weird little hesitation between them, like somebody with a limp....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe flashed a look toward the stairs. Hugh had just rounded the top. He was out of breath and bleeding\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efrom cuts on his face. But as soon as he saw her and the vampire he waved his arms and yelled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hey! Ugly Undead! Your friend missed me! You want to have a try?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh? Jez thought in disbelief. Fighting?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on, hey; I\u0027m here; I\u0027m easy.\" Hugh was hopping toward the vampire, who was also flashing looks\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eat him, trying to assess this new danger while not taking his focus off Jez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You want to go a few rounds?\" Hugh dropped into a boxer\u0027s pose, throwing punches at the air. \"Huh?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou want to try for the title?\" All the time\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehe was speaking, he was dancing closer to the vampire, circling to get behind him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeautiful, Jez thought. All she needed was for the vampire to shift his attention for one second-just to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eglance behind him once-and she could kick his face in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn\u0027t work that way. Something went wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe vampire tried to glance behind him. Jez saw her chance and made the kick, a high kick that snapped\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehis head back. But somehow instead of falling backward the vampire managed to blunder forward\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estraight at her. She could easily have gotten away-except for Claire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire had obediently kept behind her-even when behind her meant standing right by the BART tracks,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon the yellow metal squares that marked the edge of the platform. Now, as the vampire stumbled\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eforward and Jez began to slide out of the way, she heard Claire gasp, felt Claire clutch at her wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew what had happened instantly. Claire had tried to run the wrong way and was teetering on the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eedge of the platform. More, she was taking Jez with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a distant rumble like thunder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez knew she could save herself-by getting rid of Claire. She could use Claire\u0027s body as a springboard to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003epropel herself away from the drop. That way, only one of them would die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, she tried to twist and throw Claire away from her, toward safety. It didn\u0027t work. They both lost\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etheir balance. Jez had the strange, surprised\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efeeling one gets in the middle of a fell-where\u0027s the ground?-and then she hit it\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was a bad fell because she was tangled with Claire. All Jez could do was try to keep Claire* away\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003efrom the third rail on the far side of the track. The impact winded both of them and Jez saw stars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe could hear Hugh screaming her name. The distant thunder had become a roaring, whizzing sound,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecarried through the tracks underneath Jez. Down here, she could feel a rattling that wasn\u0027t audible from\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eabove. It was a noise that filled her head and shook her body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe knew absolutely, in that instant, that they were going to die.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth of them. Crushed to pieces under the train. The white dragon would run right over them and not\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeven know it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was simply no chance. Claire was clinging to her desperately, clawing Jez\u0027s arms hard enough to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edraw blood, and gasping in the breath for a scream. And even if Jez had been a full vampire, she couldn\u0027t\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehave lifted Claire the four feet to the platform fast enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing to save them, no hope. No rescue. It was over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this flashed through Jez\u0027s mind in the single instant it took her to look up and see the train bearing\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edown on them. Its sleek white nose was only thirty feet away, and it was braking, but nowhere near fast\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eenough, and this was it, the actual moment of her death, the last thoughts she would\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eever think, and the last thing she would ever see was white, white, white-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt happened all at once, filling her vision. One second she could see clearly, the next the entire world was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eblue. Not just blue. Fiery, dazzling, lightning-shot blue. Like being inside some sort of science-fiction\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003especial effect. There was blue streaming and crackling and sizzling all around her, a cocoon of blue that\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eenfolded her and shot past her and disappeared somewhere ahead. |\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m dead, Jez thought. So this is what it\u0027s like. Completely different from what people say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she realized that she could hear a faint shrieking sound beneath her. It was Claire. They were still\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eholding on to each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0027re both dead. Or we\u0027ve fallen into some kind of space warp. The rest of the world is gone. There\u0027s\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejust-this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had an impulse to touch the blue stuff, but she couldn\u0027t move because of Claire\u0027s grip on her arms. It\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emight not have been safe anyway. Where it flowed over her, she could feel a sort of zinging and tingling\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eas if all her blood were being excited. It smelled like the air after a storm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then it disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll at once. Not by stages. But it still took Jez several moments to see anything, because her eyes were\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eblinded with dark yellow after-images. They burned and danced in front of her like a new kind of\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elightning, and she only gradually realized where she was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the train tracks. Exactly where she had been before. Except that now there was a huge, sleek BART\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etrain two feet in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to tilt her head to look up at its nose? It was gigantic from this angle, a monster of white, like the\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eiceberg that sank the Titanic. And it was stopped dead, looking as if it had always been here, like some\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emountainous landmark. As if it had never moved an inch in its history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople were yelling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShrieking and yowling and making all kinds of noise. It seemed to come from far away, but when Jez\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003elooked she could see them staring down at her. They were at the edge of the platform, waving their arms\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehysterically. As Jez stared back at them, a couple jumped down to the tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez looked down at her cousin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire was dragging in huge breaths, hyperventilating, her whole body shaking in spasms. She was\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003estaring at the train that loomed over them with eyes that showed white all around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA loudspeaker was booming. One of the people who had jumped, a man in a security guard\u0027s uniform,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas jabbering at Jez. She couldn\u0027t understand a word he was saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Claire, we\u0027ve got to go now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer cousin just whooped in air, sobbing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Claire, we have to go now. Come on.\" Jez\u0027s whole body felt light and strange, and when she tried to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emove she felt as if she were floating. But she could move. She stood up and pulled Claire with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe realized that somebody was calling her name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was the other person who had jumped to the tracks. It was Hugh. He was reaching for her. His gray\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eeyes were as wide as Claire\u0027s, but not wide and hysterical. Wide and still. He was the only calm person\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ein the crowd, beside Jez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on. Up this way,\" he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe helped her boost Claire to the platform, and then Jez scrambled up and reached down to help him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they were all up, Jez glanced around. She knew she was looking for something-yes. There. The\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewerewolves she\u0027d knocked out. It seemed a hundred years ago, but they were still lying there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The other guy got away,\" Hugh said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then we have to get out of here fast.\" Jez heard her own voice, sounding quiet and faraway. But she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ewas beginning to feel more attached to her body. Hugh was guiding Claire toward the escalator. Jez got\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eon the other side of Claire, and they both helped keep her on her feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe security guy was behind them, yelling. Jez still couldn\u0027t understand him and ignored him completely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they reached the lower level, she and Hugh began to walk faster, pulling Claire along with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey shoved Claire through the handicapped gate by the ticket window and vaulted over themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom down here, Jez could see that the train was smoking all along its bottom. White smoke that sizzled\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eup into the muggy air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We can\u0027t go on the street,\" Hugh said. \"They\u0027ve got cars out there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The garage,\" Jez said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey both headed for it, a multi-story brick building that looked dark and cool inside. They were almost\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003erunning with Claire, now, and they didn\u0027t stop until they were deep within the bowels of the garage, with\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eemptiness echoing all around them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen Jez sagged against a brick pillar. Hugh bent over with his hands on his knees. Claire simply folded\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eto the ground like a marionette with all its strings cut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez let herself breathe for a few minutes, let her brain settle down, before slowly lowering herself beside\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher cousin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey all looked as if they\u0027d been in an accident. Hugh\u0027s shirt was ripped and there was drying blood all\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edown one side of his face. Claire\u0027s hair was wildly disheveled, and there were scrapes and small cuts on\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eher face and arms. Jez herself had lost a lot of skin to the tracks, and her forearms were bleeding where\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire had scratched her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut they were alive. Beyond all hope, they were alive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClaire looked up just then to find Jez gazing at her. They sat for several moments simply staring into each\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eother\u0027s eyes. Then Jez reached out to touch her cousin\u0027s cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was you,\" she whispered. \"All that time-and it was you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked up at Hugh and began to laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looked back, his face pale in the semi-darkness. He shook his head and began to laugh, too, but\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eshakily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, Goddess,\" he said. \"I thought you were dead, there, Jez. I thought I\u0027d lost you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not while she\u0027s around, apparently,\" Jez said, and laughed harder. She was slightly hysterical, but she\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edidn\u0027t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHugh\u0027s laughter sounded a little like crying. \"I saw that train-and there was no way it was going to stop in\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003etime. And then-that light. It just shot out-and the train hit it. It was like a physical thing. Like a giant\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ecushion. The train hit it and it squashed and the train went slower and then it kept squashing-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez stopped laughing. \"I wonder if the people on the train got hurt.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know.\" Hugh was sober now, too. \"They must\u0027ve gotten thrown around. It stopped so fast. But\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eit didn\u0027t smash. They\u0027re probably okay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just-from the inside, it looked like lightning-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From the outside, too. I didn\u0027t imagine it would look like that-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I didn\u0027t know it would be so powerful. And, think about it; she\u0027s untrained-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere they were, an Old Soul and a vampire hunter who\u0027d seen everything the streets had to offer,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ebabbling like a couple of kids.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was Claire who stopped them. She had been looking from one of them to the other, getting more and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003emore agitated. Now she grabbed Jez\u0027s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you guys talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJez turned to her. She glanced at Hugh, then spoke gently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re talking about you, Claire. You\u0027re the Wild Power.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-huntress-night-world-7/page-15.html","bookId":1863,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:36 PM"}
