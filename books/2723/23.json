Growing up with Steven and spending my summers with Jeremiah and Conrad, winning was always important, and doubly so because I was a girl and was never expected to win anything. Victory is a thousand times sweeter when you\u0027re the underdog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCam came over, and I watched from my bedroom window as he drove up. His car was navy blue and old and beat-up looking, like his hoodie that I was already planning on keeping. It looked like exactly the kind of car he\u0027d drive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe rang the doorbell, and I flew down the stairs to open the door. \"Hi,\" I said. I was wearing his hoodie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wearing my hoodie,\" he said, smiling down at me. He was even taller than I\u0027d remembered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know, I was thinking that I want to keep it,\" I told him, letting him in and closing the door behind me. \"But I don\u0027t expect to get it for free. I\u0027ll race you for it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But if we race, you can\u0027t be mad if I beat you,\" he \u0026gt;said, raising an eyebrow at me. \"It\u0027s my favorite hoodie, and if I win, I\u0027m taking it.\" \"No problem,\" I told him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe went out to the pool through the back screen door, down the porch steps. I threw off my shorts and T-shirt and his hoodie quickly, without even thinking-- Jeremiah and I raced all the time in the pool. It didn\u0027t occur to me to be self-conscious to be in a bikini in front of Cam. After all, we spent the whole summer in bathing suits in that house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he looked away quickly and took off his T-shirt. \"Ready?\" he said, standing by the edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked over next to him. \"One full lap?\" I asked, dipping my toe into the water.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure,\" he said. \"You want a head start?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI snorted. \"Do you want a head start?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Touche,\" he said, grinning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027d never heard a boy say \"touch√©\" before. Or anyone else, for that matter. Maybe my mother. But on him it looked good. It was different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI won the first race easily. \"You let me win,\" I accused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I didn\u0027t,\" he said, but I knew it wasn\u0027t true. In all the summers and all of the races, no boy, not Conrad or Jeremiah or certainly not Steven, had ever let me win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You better give it your all this time,\" I warned. \"Or I\u0027m keeping the hoodie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Best two out of three,\" Cam said, wiping the hair out of his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe won the next heat, and I won the last one. I wasn\u0027t fully convinced that he didn\u0027t just let me win--after all, he was so tall and long, his one stroke was worth two of mine. But I wanted to keep the hoodie, so I didn\u0027t challenge the win. After all, a win was a win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he had to leave, I walked him to his car. He didn\u0027t get in right away. There was this long pause, the first we\u0027d had, if you can believe it. Cam cleared his throat and said, \"So this guy I know, Kinsey, is having a party tomorrow night. Do you maybe want to come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah,\" I said right away. \"I do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made the mistake of mentioning it at breakfast the next morning. My mother and Susannah were grocery shopping. It was just me and the boys, the way it had been for the most part this summer. \"I\u0027m going to a party tonight,\" I said, partly just to say it out loud and partly to brag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad raised his eyebrows. \"You?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whose party?\" Jeremiah demanded. \"Kinsey s?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put down my juice. \"How\u0027d you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah laughed and wagged his finger at me. \"I know everybody in Cousins, Belly. I\u0027m a lifeguard. That\u0027s like being the mayor. Greg Kinsey works at that surf shop over by the mall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrowning, Conrad said, \"Doesn\u0027t Greg Kinsey sell crystal meth out of his trunk?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? No. Cam wouldn\u0027t be friends with someone like that,\" I said defensively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027s Cam?\" Jeremiah asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That guy I met at Clay\u0027s bonfire. He asked me to go to this party with him, and I said yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sorry. You aren\u0027t going to some meth addict\u0027s party,\" Conrad said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was the second time Conrad was trying to tell me what to do, and I was sick of it. Who did he think he was? I had to go to this party. I didn\u0027t care if there was crystal meth or not, I was going. \"I\u0027m telling you, Cam wouldn\u0027t be friends with someone like that! He\u0027s straight edge.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad and Jeremiah both snorted. In moments like these, they were a team. \"He\u0027s straight edge?\" Jeremiah said, trying not to smile. \"Neat.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very cool,\" agreed Conrad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glared at the both of them. First they didn\u0027t want me hanging out with meth addicts, and then being straight edge wasn\u0027t cool either. \"He doesn\u0027t do drugs, all right? Which is why I highly doubt he\u0027d be friends with a drug dealer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah scratched his cheek and said, \"You know what, it might be Greg Rosenberg who\u0027s the meth dealer. Greg Kinsey\u0027s pretty cool. He has a pool table. I think I\u0027ll check this party out too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait, what?\" I was starting to panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think I\u0027ll go too,\" Conrad said. \"I like pool.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stood up. \"You guys can\u0027t come. You weren\u0027t invited.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConrad leaned back in his chair and put his arms behind his head. \"Don\u0027t worry, Belly. We won\u0027t bother you on your big date.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Unless he puts his hands on you.\" Jeremiah ground his fist into his hand threateningly, his blue eyes narrow. \"Then his ass is grass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This isn\u0027t happening,\" I moaned. \"You guys, I\u0027m begging you. Don\u0027t come. Please, please don\u0027t come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJeremiah ignored me. \"Con, what are you gonna wear?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I haven\u0027t thought about it. Maybe my khaki shorts? What are you gonna wear?\" \"I hate you guys,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings had been weird with me and Conrad and also with me and Jeremiah--an impossible thought crept its way into my head. Was it possible they didn\u0027t want me with Cam? Because they, like, had feelings for me? Could that even be? I doubted it. I was like a little sister to them. Only, I wasn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I finished getting ready and it was almost time to go, I stopped by Susannah\u0027s room to say good-bye. She and my mother were holed up in there sorting through old pictures. Susannah was all ready for bed, even though\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e138\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eit was still pretty early. She had her pillows propped up around her, and she was wearing one of her silk robes that Mr. Fisher had bought her on a business trip to Hong Kong. It was poppy and cream, and when I got married, I wanted one just like it. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-23.html","bookId":2723,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:12 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:12:12 PM"}
