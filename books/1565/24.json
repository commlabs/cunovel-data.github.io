The Gryffindor common room was much quieter than it had been lately, many yawns punctuating the lazy conversations. Hermione\u0027s hair was bushy again; she confessed to Harry that she had used liberal amounts of Sleekeazy\u0027s Hair Potion on it for the ball, \"but it\u0027s way too much bother to do every day,\" she said matter-of-factly, scratching a purring Crookshanks behind the ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon and Hermione seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement not to discuss their argument. They were being quite friendly to each other, though oddly formal. Ron and Harry wasted no time in telling Hermione about the conversation they had overheard between Madame Maxime and Hagrid, but Hermione didn\u0027t seem to find the news that Hagrid was a half-giant nearly as shocking as Ron did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I thought he must be,\" she said, shrugging. \"I knew he couldn\u0027t be pure giant because they\u0027re about twenty feet tall. But honestly, all this hysteria about giants. They can\u0027t all be horrible....It\u0027s the same sort of prejudice that people have toward werewolves....It\u0027s just bigotry, isn\u0027t it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon looked as though he would have liked to reply scathingly, but perhaps he didn\u0027t want another row, because he contented himself with shaking his head disbelievingly while Hermione wasn\u0027t looking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time now to think of the homework they had neglected during the first week of the holidays. Everybody seemed to be feeling rather flat now that Christmas was over - everybody except Harry, that is, who was starting (once again) to feel slightly nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe trouble was that February the twenty-fourth looked a lot closer from this side of Christmas, and he still hadn\u0027t done anything about working out the clue inside the golden egg. He therefore started taking the egg out of his trunk every time he went up to the dormitory, opening it, and listening intently, hoping that this time it would make some sense. He strained to think what the sound reminded him of, apart from thirty musical saws, but he had never heard anything else like it. He closed the egg, shook it vigorously, and opened it again to see if the sound had changed, but it hadn\u0027t. He tried asking the egg questions, shouting over all the wailing, but nothing happened. He even threw the egg across the room - though he hadn\u0027t really expected that to help.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry had not forgotten the hint that Cedric had given him, but his less-than-friendly feelings toward Cedric just now meant that he was keen not to take his help if he could avoid it. In any case, it seemed to him that if Cedric had really wanted to give Harry a hand, he would have been a lot more explicit. He, Harry, had told Cedric exactly what was coming in the first task - and Cedric\u0027s idea of a fair exchange had been to tell Harry to take a bath. Well, he didn\u0027t need that sort of rubbishy help - not from someone who kept walking down corridors hand in hand with Cho, anyway. And so the first day of the new term arrived, and Harry set off to lessons, weighed down with books, parchment, and quills as usual, but also with the lurking worry of the egg heavy in his stomach, as though he were carrying that around with him too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnow was still thick upon the grounds, and the greenhouse windows were covered in condensation so thick that they couldn\u0027t see out of them in Herbology. Nobody was looking forward to Care of Magical Creatures much in this weather, though as Ron said, the skrewts would probably warm them up nicely, either by chasing them, or blasting off so forcefully that Hagrid\u0027s cabin would catch fire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen they arrived at Hagrid \u0027s cabin, however, they found an elderly witch with closely cropped gray hair and a very prominent chin standing before his front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hurry up, now, the bell rang five minutes ago,\" she barked at them as they struggled toward her through the snow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who\u0027re you?\" said Ron, staring at her. \"Where\u0027s Hagrid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My name is Professor Grubbly-Plank,\" she said briskly. \"I am your temporary Care of Magical Creatures teacher.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Hagrid?\" Harry repeated loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is indisposed,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank shortly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoft and unpleasant laughter reached Harry\u0027s ears. He turned; Draco Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherins were joining the class. All of them looked gleeful, and none of them looked surprised to see Professor Grubbly-Plank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This way, please,\" said Professor Grubbly-Plank, and she strode off around the paddock where the Beauxbatons horses were shivering. Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed her, looking back over their shoulders at Hagrid\u0027s cabin. All the curtains were closed. Was Hagrid in there, alone and ill?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s wrong with Hagrid?\" Harry said, hurrying to catch up with Professor Grubbly-Plank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Never you mind,\" she said as though she thought he was being nosy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do mind, though,\" said Harry hotly. \"What\u0027s up with him?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProfessor Grubbly-Plank acted as though she couldn\u0027t hear him. She led them past the paddock where the huge Beauxbatons horses were standing, huddled against the cold, and toward a tree on the edge of the forest, where a large and beautiful unicorn was tethered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany of the girls \"ooooohed!\" at the sight of the unicorn.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh it\u0027s so beautiful!\" whispered Lavender Brown. \"How did she get it? They\u0027re supposed to be really hard to catch!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe unicorn was so brightly white it made the snow all around look gray. It was pawing the ground nervously with its golden hooves and throwing back its horned head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Boys keep back!\" barked Professor Grubbly-Plank, throwing out an arm and catching Harry hard in the chest. \"They prefer the woman\u0027s touch, unicorns. Girls to the front, and approach with care, come on, easy does it....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe and the girls walked slowly forward toward the unicorn, leaving the boys standing near the paddock fence, watching. The moment Professor Grubbly-Plank was out of earshot. Harry turned to Ron.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What d\u0027you reckons wrong with him? You don\u0027t think a skrewt -?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh he hasn\u0027t been attacked, Potter, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re thinking,\" said Malfoy softly. \"No, he\u0027s just too ashamed to show his big, ugly face.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What d\u0027you mean?\" said Harry sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMalfoy put his hand inside the pocket of his robes and pulled out a folded page of newsprint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There you go,\" he said. \"Hate to break it to you. Potter....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe smirked as Harry snatched the page, unfolded it, and read it, with Ron, Seamus, Dean, and Neville looking over his shoulder. It was an article topped with a picture of Hagrid looking extremely shifty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDUMBLEDORE\u0027S GIANT MISTAKE\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlbus Dumbledore, eccentric Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, has never been afraid to make controversial staff appointments, writes Rita Skeeter, Special Correspondent. In September of this year, he hired Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody, the notoriously jinx-happy ex-Auror, to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts, a decision that caused many raised eyebrows at the Ministry of Magic, given Moody\u0027s well-known habit of attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence. Mad-Eye Moody, however, looks responsible and kindly when set beside the part-human Dumbledore employs to teach Care of Magical Creatures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRubeus Hagrid, who admits to being expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school ever since, a job secured for him by Dumbledore. Last year, however, Hagrid used his mysterious influence over the headmaster to secure the additional post of Care of Magical Creatures teacher, over the heads of many better-qualified candidates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn alarmingly large and ferocious-looking man, Hagrid has been using his newfound authority to terrify the students in his care with a succession of horrific creatures. While Dumbledore turns a blind eye, Hagrid has maimed several pupils during a series of lessons that many admit to being \"very frightening.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I was attacked by a hippogriff, and my friend Vincent Crabbe got a bad bite off a flobberworm,\" says Draco Malfoy, a fourth-year student. \"We all hate Hagrid, but we\u0027re just too scared to say anything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHagrid has no intention of ceasing his campaign of intimidation, however. In conversation with a Daily Prophet reporter last month, he admitted breeding creatures he has dubbed \"Blast-Ended Skrewts,\" highly dangerous crosses between manti-cores and fire-crabs. The creation of new breeds of magical creature is, of course, an activity usually closely observed by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. Hagrid, however, considers himself to be above such petty restrictions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was just having some fun,\" he says, before hastily changing the subject.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs if this were not enough, the Daily Prophet has now unearthed evidence that Hagrid is not - as he has always pretended - a pure-blood wizard. He is not, in fact, even pure human. His mother, we can exclusively reveal, is none other than the giantess Fridwulfa, whose whereabouts are currently unknown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBloodthirsty and brutal, the giants brought themselves to the point of extinction by warring amongst themselves during the last century. The handful that remained joined the ranks of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, and were responsible for some of the worst mass Muggle killings of his reign of terror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile many of the giants who served He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named were killed by Aurors working against the Dark Side, Fridwulfa was not among them. It is possible she escaped to one of the giant communities still existing in foreign mountain ranges. If his antics during Care of Magical Creatures lessons are any guide, however, Frid-wulfa\u0027s son appears to have inherited her brutal nature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a bizarre twist, Hagrid is reputed to have developed a close friendship with the boy who brought around You-Know-Who\u0027s fall from power - thereby driving Hagrid\u0027s own mother, like the rest of You-Know-Who\u0027s supporters, into hiding. Perhaps Harry Potter is unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large friend - but Albus Dumbledore surely has a duty to ensure that Harry Potter, along with his fellow students, is warned about the dangers of associating with part-giants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry finished reading and looked up at Ron, whose mouth was hanging open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did she find out?\" he whispered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut that wasn\u0027t what was bothering Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What d\u0027you mean, \u0027we all hate Hagrid\u0027?\" Harry spat at Malfoy. \"What\u0027s this rubbish about him\" - he pointed at Crabbe - \"getting a bad bite off a flobberworm? They haven\u0027t even got teeth!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrabbe was sniggering, apparently very pleased with himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I think this should put an end to the oaf\u0027s teaching career,\" said Malfoy, his eyes glinting. \"Half-giant...and there was me thinking he\u0027d just swallowed a bottle of Skele-Gro when he was young....None of the mummies and daddies are going to like this at all....They\u0027ll be worried he\u0027ll eat their kids, ha, ha....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you paying attention over there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProfessor Grubbly-Planks voice carried over to the boys; the girls were all clustered around the unicorn now, stroking it. Harry was so angry that the Daily Prophet article shook in his hands as he turned to stare unseeingly at the unicorn, whose many magical properties Professor Grubbly-Plank was now enumerating in a loud voice, so that the boys could hear too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope she stays, that woman!\" said Parvati Patil when the lesson had ended and they were all heading back to the castle for lunch. \"That\u0027s more what I thought Care of Magical Creatures would be like...proper creatures like unicorns, not monsters....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about Hagrid?\" Harry said angrily as they went up the steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about him?\" said Parvati in a hard voice. \"He can still be gamekeeper, can\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParvati had been very cool toward Harry since the ball. He supposed that he ought to have paid her a bit more attention, but she seemed to have had a good time all the same. She was certainly telling anybody who would listen that she had made arrangements to meet the boy from Beauxbatons in Hogsmeade on the next weekend trip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was a really good lesson,\" said Hermione as they entered the Great Hall. \"I didn\u0027t know half the things Professor Grubbly-Plank told us about uni -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at this!\" Harry snarled, and he shoved the Daily Prophet article under Hermione\u0027s nose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione\u0027s mouth fell open as she read. Her reaction was exactly the same as Ron\u0027s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did that horrible Skeeter woman find out? You don\u0027t think Hagrid told her?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Harry, leading the way over to the Gryffindor table and throwing himself into a chair, furious. \"He never even told us, did he? I reckon she was so mad he wouldn\u0027t give her loads of horrible stuff about me, she went ferreting around to get him back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe she heard him telling Madame Maxime at the ball,\" said Hermione quietly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027d have seen her in the garden!\" said Ron. \"Anyway, she\u0027s not supposed to come into school anymore, Hagrid said Dumbledore banned her....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe she\u0027s got an Invisibility Cloak,\" said Harry, ladling chicken casserole onto his plate and splashing it everywhere in his anger. \"Sort of thing she\u0027d do, isn\u0027t it, hide in bushes listening to people.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like you and Ron did, you mean,\" said Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We weren\u0027t trying to hear him!\" said Ron indignantly. \"We didn\u0027t have any choice! The stupid prat, talking about his giantess mother where anyone could have heard him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027ve got to go and see him,\" said Harry. \"This evening, after Divination. Tell him we want him back...you do want him back?\" he shot at Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I - well, I\u0027m not going to pretend it didn\u0027t make a nice change, having a proper Care of Magical Creatures lesson for once - but I do want Hagrid back, of course I do!\" Hermione added hastily, quailing under Harry\u0027s furious stare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo that evening after dinner, the three of them left the castle once more and went down through the frozen grounds to Hagrid\u0027s cabin. They knocked, and Fang\u0027s booming barks answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hagrid, it\u0027s us!\" Harry shouted, pounding on the door. \"Open up!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHagrid didn\u0027t answer. They could hear Fang scratching at the door, whining, but it didn\u0027t open. They hammered on it for ten more minutes; Ron even went and banged on one of the windows, but there was no response.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s he avoiding us for?\" Hermione said when they had finally given up and were walking back to the school. \"He surely doesn\u0027t think we\u0027d care about him being half-giant?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it seemed that Hagrid did care. They didn\u0027t see a sign of him all week. He didn\u0027t appear at the staff table at mealtimes, they didn\u0027t see him going about his gamekeeper duties on the grounds, and Professor Grubbly-Plank continued to take the Care of Magical Creatures classes. Malfoy was gloating at every possible opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Missing your half-breed pal?\" he kept whispering to Harry whenever there was a teacher around, so that he was safe from Harry\u0027s retaliation. \"Missing the elephant-man?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a Hogsmeade visit halfway through January. Hermione was very surprised that Harry was going to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just thought you\u0027d want to take advantage of the common room being quiet,\" she said. \"Really get to work on that egg.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh I - I reckon I\u0027ve got a pretty good idea what it\u0027s about now,\" Harry lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you really?\" said Hermione, looking impressed. \"Well done!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry\u0027s insides gave a guilty squirm, but he ignored them. He still had five weeks to work out that egg clue, after all, and that was ages...whereas if he went into Hogsmeade, he might run into Hagrid, and get a chance to persuade him to come back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together on Saturday and set off through the cold, wet grounds toward the gates. As they passed the Durmstrang ship moored in the lake, they saw Viktor Krum emerge onto the deck, dressed in nothing but swimming trunks. He was very skinny indeed, but apparently a lot tougher than he looked, because he climbed up onto the side of the ship, stretched out his arms, and dived, right into the lake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s mad!\" said Harry, staring at Krum\u0027s dark head as it bobbed out into the middle of the lake. \"It must be freezing, it\u0027s January!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s a lot colder where he comes from,\" said Hermione. \"I suppose it feels quite warm to him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, but there\u0027s still the giant squid,\" said Ron. He didn\u0027t sound anxious - if anything, he sounded hopeful. Hermione noticed his tone of voice and frowned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s really nice, you know,\" she said. \"He\u0027s not at all like you\u0027d think, coming from Durmstrang. He likes it much better here, he told me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRon said nothing. He hadn\u0027t mentioned Viktor Krum since the ball, but Harry had found a miniature arm under his bed on Boxing Day, which had looked very much as though it had been snapped off a small model figure wearing Bulgarian Quidditch robes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry kept his eyes skinned for a sign of Hagrid all the way down the slushy High Street, and suggested a visit to the Three Broomsticks once he had ascertained that Hagrid was not in any of the shops.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pub was as crowded as ever, but one quick look around at all the tables told Harry that Hagrid wasn\u0027t there. Heart sinking, he went up to the bar with Ron and Hermione, ordered three butterbeers from Madam Rosmerta, and thought gloomily that he might just as well have stayed behind and listened to the egg wailing after all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Doesn\u0027t he ever go into the office?\" Hermione whispered suddenly. \"Look!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pointed into the mirror behind the bar, and Harry saw Ludo Bagman reflected there, sitting in a shadowy corner with a bunch of goblins. Bagman was talking very fast in a low voice to the goblins, all of whom had their arms crossed and were looking rather menacing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was indeed odd. Harry thought, that Bagman was here at the Three Broomsticks on a weekend when there was no Triwizard event, and therefore no judging to be done. He watched Bagman in the mirror. He was looking strained again, quite as strained as he had that night in the forest before the Dark Mark had appeared. But just then Bagman glanced over at the bar, saw Harry, and stood up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In a moment, in a moment!\" Harry heard him say brusquely to the goblins, and Bagman hurried through the pub toward Harry, his boyish grin back in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry!\" he said. \"How are you? Been hoping to run into you! Everything going all right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine, thanks,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonder if I could have a quick, private word, Harry?\" said Bagman eagerly. \"You couldn\u0027t give us a moment, you two, could you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er - okay,\" said Ron, and he and Hermione went off to find a table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBagman led Harry along the bar to the end furthest from Madam Rosmerta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I just thought I\u0027d congratulate you again on your splendid performance against that Horntail, Harry,\" said Bagman. \"Really superb.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thanks,\" said Harry, but he knew this couldn\u0027t be all that Bagman wanted to say, because he could have congratulated Harry in front of Ron and Hermione. Bagman didn\u0027t seem in any particular rush to spill the beans, though. Harry saw him glance into the mirror over the bar at the goblins, who were all watching him and Harry in silence through their dark, slanting eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Absolute nightmare,\" said Bagman to Harry in an undertone, noticing Harry watching the goblins too. \"Their English isn\u0027t too good...it\u0027s like being back with all the Bulgarians at the Quidditch World Cup...but at least they used sign language another human could recognize. This lot keep gabbling in Gobblede-gook...and I only know one word of Gobbledegook. Bladvak. It means \u0027pickax.\u0027 I don\u0027t like to use it in case they think I\u0027m threatening them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe gave a short, booming laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What do they want?\" Harry said, noticing how the goblins were still watching Bagman very closely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er - well...\" said Bagman, looking suddenly nervous. \"They...er...they\u0027re looking for Barty Crouch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are they looking for him here?\" said Harry. \"He\u0027s at the Ministry in London, isn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er...as a matter of fact, I\u0027ve no idea where he is,\" said Bagman. \"He\u0027s sort of...stopped coming to work. Been absent for a couple of weeks now. Young Percy, his assistant, says he\u0027s ill. Apparently he\u0027s just been sending instructions in by owl. But would you mind not mentioning that to anyone. Harry? Because Rita Skeeter\u0027s still poking around everywhere she can, and I\u0027m willing to bet she\u0027d work up Bartys illness into something sinister. Probably say he\u0027s gone missing like Bertha Jorkins.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you heard anything about Bertha Jorkins?\" Harry asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" said Bagman, looking strained again. \"I\u0027ve got people looking, of course...\" (About time, thought Harry) \"and it\u0027s all very strange. She definitely arrived in Albania, because she met her second cousin there. And then she left the cousin\u0027s house to go south and see an aunt...and she seems to have vanished without trace en route. Blowed if I can see where she\u0027s got to...she doesn\u0027t seem the type to elope, for instance...but still....What are we doing, talking about goblins and Bertha Jorkins? I really wanted to ask you\" - he lowered his voice - \"how are you getting on with your golden egg?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er...not bad,\" Harry said untruthfully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBagman seemed to know he wasn\u0027t being honest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Listen, Harry,\" he said (still in a very low voice), \"I feel very bad about all this...you were thrown into this tournament, you didn\u0027t volunteer for it...and if...\" (his voice was so quiet now, Harry had to lean closer to listen) \"if I can help at all...a prod in the right direction...I\u0027ve taken a liking to you...the way you got past that dragon!...well, just say the word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry stared up into Bagman\u0027s round, rosy face and his wide, baby-blue eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We\u0027re supposed to work out the clues alone, aren\u0027t we?\" he said, careful to keep his voice casual and not sound as though he was accusing the head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports of breaking the rules.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well...well, yes,\" said Bagman impatiently, \"but - come on. Harry - we all want a Hogwarts victory, don\u0027t we?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have you offered Cedric help?\" Harry said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe smallest of frowns creased Bagman\u0027s smooth face. \"No, I haven\u0027t,\" he said. \"I - well, like I say, I\u0027ve taken a liking to you. Just thought I\u0027d offer...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, thanks,\" said Harry, \"but I think I\u0027m nearly there with the egg...couple more days should crack it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe wasn\u0027t entirely sure why he was refusing Bagman\u0027s help, except that Bagman was almost a stranger to him, and accepting his assistance would feel somehow much more like cheating than asking advice from Ron, Hermione, or Sirius.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBagman looked almost affronted, but couldn\u0027t say much more as Fred and George turned up at that point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hello, Mr. Bagman,\" said Fred brightly. \"Can we buy you a drink?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er...no,\" said Bagman, with a last disappointed glance at Harry, \"no, thank you, boys...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFred and George looked quite as disappointed as Bagman, who was surveying Harry as though he had let him down badly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I must dash,\" he said. \"Nice seeing you all. Good luck, Harry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hurried out of the pub. The goblins all slid off their chairs and exited after him. Harry went to rejoin Ron and Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What did he want?\" Ron said, the moment Harry had sat down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He offered to help me with the golden egg,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He shouldn\u0027t be doing that!\" said Hermione, looking very shocked. \"He\u0027s one of the judges! And anyway, you\u0027ve already worked it out - haven\u0027t you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er...nearly,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, I don\u0027t think Dumbledore would like it if he knew Bagman was trying to persuade you to cheat!\" said Hermione, still looking deeply disapproving. \"I hope he\u0027s trying to help Cedric as much!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s not, I asked,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who cares if Diggory\u0027s getting help?\" said Ron. Harry privately agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those goblins didn\u0027t look very friendly,\" said Hermione, sipping her butterbeer. \"What were they doing here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Looking for Crouch, according to Bagman,\" said Harry. \"He\u0027s still ill.

She was wearing banana-yellow robes today; her long nails were painted shocking pink, and she was accompanied by her paunchy photographer. She bought drinks, and she and the photographer made their way through the crowds to a table nearby. Harry, Ron, and Hermione glaring at her as she approached. She was talking fast and looking very satisfied about something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"...didn\u0027t seem very keen to talk to us, did he, Bozo? Now, why would that be, do you think? And what\u0027s he doing with a pack of goblins in tow anyway? Showing them the sights...what nonsense...he was always a bad liar. Reckon something\u0027s up? Think we should do a bit of digging? \u0027Disgraced Ex-Head of Magical Games and Sports, Ludo Bagman...\u0027 Snappy start to a sentence, Bozo - we just need to find a story to fit it -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Trying to ruin someone else\u0027s life?\" said Harry loudly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few people looked around. Rita Skeeter\u0027s eyes widened behind her jeweled spectacles as she saw who had spoken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Harry!\" she said, beaming. \"How lovely! Why don\u0027t you come and join-?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wouldn\u0027t come near you with a ten-foot broomstick,\" said Harry furiously. \"What did you do that to Hagrid for, eh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRita Skeeter raised her heavily penciled eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our readers have a right to the truth, Harry. I am merely doing my-\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who cares if he\u0027s half-giant?\" Harry shouted. \"There\u0027s nothing wrong with him!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe whole pub had gone very quiet. Madam Rosmerta was staring over from behind the bar, apparently oblivious to the fact that the flagon she was filling with mead was overflowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRita Skeeter\u0027s smile flickered very slightly, but she hitched it back almost at once; she snapped open her crocodile-skin handbag, pulled out her Quick-Quotes Quill, and said, \"How about giving me an interview about the Hagrid you know. Harry? The man behind the muscles? Your unlikely friendship and the reasons behind it. Would you call him a father substitute?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione stood up very abruptly, her butterbeer clutched in her hand as though it were a grenade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You horrible woman,\" she said, through gritted teeth, \"you don\u0027t care, do you, anything for a story, and anyone will do, wont they? Even Ludo Bagman -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sit down, you silly little girl, and don\u0027t talk about things you don\u0027t understand,\" said Rita Skeeter coldly, her eyes hardening as they fell on Hermione. \"I know things about Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl...not that it needs it -\" she added, eyeing Hermione\u0027s bushy hair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s go,\" said Hermione, \"c\u0027mon.

Rita Skeeter\u0027s Quick-Quotes Quill was out; it was zooming backward and forward over a piece of parchment on the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027ll be after you next, Hermione,\" said Ron in a low and worried voice as they walked quickly back up the street.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let her try!\" said Hermione defiantly; she was shaking with rage. \"I\u0027ll show her! Silly little girl, am I? Oh, I\u0027ll get her back for this. First Harry, then Hagrid...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t want to go upsetting Rita Skeeter,\" said Ron nervously. \"I\u0027m serious, Hermione, she\u0027ll dig up something on you -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My parents don\u0027t read the Daily Prophet. She can\u0027t scare me into hiding!\" said Hermione, now striding along so fast that it was all Harry and Ron could do to keep up with her. The last time Harry had seen Hermione in a rage like this, she had hit Draco Malfoy around the face. \"And Hagrid isn\u0027t hiding anymore! He should never have let that excuse for a human being upset him! Come on!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBreaking into a run, she led them all the way back up the road, through the gates flanked by winged boars, and up through the grounds to Hagrid\u0027s cabin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe curtains were still drawn, and they could hear Fang barking as they approached.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hagrid!\" Hermione shouted, pounding on his front door. \"Hagrid, that\u0027s enough! We know you\u0027re in there! Nobody cares if your mum was a giantess, Hagrid! You can\u0027t let that foul Skeeter woman do this to you! Hagrid, get out here, you\u0027re just being -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door opened. Hermione said, \"About it-!\" and then stopped, very suddenly, because she had found herself face-to-face, not with Hagrid, but with Albus Dumbledore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good afternoon,\" he said pleasantly, smiling down at them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We er we wanted to see Hagrid,\" said Hermione in a rather small voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I surmised as much,\" said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. \"Why don\u0027t you come in?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh...um...okay,\" said Hermione.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe, Ron, and Harry went into the cabin; Fang launched himself upon Harry the moment he entered, barking madly and trying to lick his ears. Harry fended off Fang and looked around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHagrid was sitting at his table, where there were two large mugs of tea. He looked a real mess. His face was blotchy, his eyes swollen, and he had gone to the other extreme where his hair was concerned; far from trying to make it behave, it now looked like a wig of tangled wire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hi, Hagrid,\" said Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHagrid looked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\u0027Lo,\" he said in a very hoarse voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"More tea, I think,\" said Dumbledore, closing the door behind Harry, Ron, and Hermione, drawing out his wand, and twiddling it; a revolving tea tray appeared in midair along with a plate of cakes. Dumbledore magicked the tray onto the table, and everybody sat down. There was a slight pause, and then Dumbledore said, \"Did you by any chance hear what Miss Granger was shouting, Hagrid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHermione went slightly pink, but Dumbledore smiled at her and continued, \"Hermione, Harry, and Ron still seem to want to know you, judging by the way they were attempting to break down the door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course we still want to know you!\" Harry said, staring at Hagrid. \"You don\u0027t think anything that Skeeter cow - sorry, Professor,\" he added quickly, looking at Dumbledore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have gone temporarily deaf and haven\u0027t any idea what you said. Harry,\" said Dumbledore, twiddling his thumbs and staring at the ceiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Er-right,\" said Harry sheepishly. \"I just meant-Hagrid, how could you think we\u0027d care what that-woman-wrote about you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo fat tears leaked out of Hagrid\u0027s beetle-black eyes and fell slowly into his tangled beard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Living proof of what I\u0027ve been telling you, Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore, still looking carefully up at the ceiling. \"I have shown you the letters from the countless parents who remember you from their own days here, telling me in no uncertain terms that if I sacked you, they would have something to say about it -\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not all of \u0027em,\" said Hagrid hoarsely. \"Not all of \u0027em wan me ter stay.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Really, Hagrid, if you are holding out for universal popularity, I\u0027m afraid you will be in this cabin for a very long time,\" said Dumbledore, now peering sternly over his half-moon spectacles. \"Not a week has passed since I became headmaster of this school when I haven\u0027t had at least one owl complaining about the way I run it. But what should I do? Barricade myself in my study and refuse to talk to anybody?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeh - yeh\u0027re not half-giant!\" said Hagrid croakily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hagrid, look what I\u0027ve got for relatives!\" Harry said furiously. \"Look at the Dursleys!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An excellent point,\" said Professor Dumbledore. \"My own brother, Aberforth, was prosecuted for practicing inappropriate charms on a goat. It was all over the papers, but did Aberforth hide? No, he did not! He held his head high and went about his business as usual! Of course, I\u0027m not entirely sure he can read, so that may not have been bravery....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come back and teach, Hagrid,\" said Hermione quietly, \"please come back, we really miss you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHagrid gulped. More tears leaked out down his cheeks and into his tangled beard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDumbledore stood up. \"I refuse to accept your resignation, Hagrid, and I expect you back at work on Monday,\" he said. \"You will join me for breakfast at eight-thirty in the Great Hall. No excuses. Good afternoon to you all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDumbledore left the cabin, pausing only to scratch Fangs ears. When the door had shut behind him, Hagrid began to sob into his dustbin-lid-sized hands. Hermione kept patting his arm, and at last, Hagrid looked up, his eyes very red indeed, and said, \"Great man, Dumbledore...great man....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah, he is,\" said Ron. \"Can I have one of these cakes, Hagrid?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help yerself,\" said Hagrid, wiping his eyes on the back of his hand. \"Ar, he\u0027s righ\u0027, o\u0027 course - yeh\u0027re all righ\u0027...I bin stupid...my ol\u0027 dad woulda bin ashamed o\u0027 the way I\u0027ve bin behavin\u0027....\" More tears leaked out, but he wiped them away more forcefully, and said, \"Never shown you a picture of my old dad, have I? Here...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHagrid got up, went over to his dresser, opened a drawer, and pulled out a picture of a short wizard with Hagrid\u0027s crinkled black eyes, beaming as he sat on top of Hagrid\u0027s shoulder. Hagrid was a good seven or eight feet tall, judging by the apple tree beside him, but his face was beardless, young, round, and smooth - he looked hardly older than eleven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tha was taken jus\u0027 after I got inter Hogwarts,\" Hagrid croaked. \"Dad was dead chuffed...thought I migh\u0027 not be a wizard, see, \u0027cos me mum...well, anyway. \u0027Course, I never was great shakes at magic, really...but at least he never saw me expelled.

Big bones...I\u0027ll give her big bones.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another nervously; Harry would rather have taken fifty Blast-Ended Skrewts for a walk than admit to Hagrid that he had overheard him talking to Madame Maxime, but Hagrid was still talking, apparently unaware that he had said anything odd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeh know wha, Harry?\" he said, looking up from the photograph of his father, his eyes very bright, \"when I firs\u0027 met you, you reminded me o\u0027 me a bit.
