A sheet of darkness covered both heaven and earth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeneath the light emanating from the scores of Kongming lanterns, the shadows of two people appeared like ghosts, accompanied by singing. One carried a pipa, the other, a bamboo flute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shadows were indistinct, the singing plaintive. Even in one’s peripheral vision it could be seen that these two were the same two who had been at Chang’an Restaurant that night. It was the white-haired old blind man, accompanied by the heartbreakingly pitiful young blind girl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would they have suddenly appeared here? Did someone make special arrangements for them to come sing their sad melody?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Beautiful hair combed and wrapped into a bun, makeup lightly applied to the face; Dark blue smoke and purple fog cover the gracefulness, catkins and gossamer strands float by with no set destination.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is not until the silkworms die, that they stop producing strands of silk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is not until the candles burn out, that they they cease to shed their tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ardor and bravery in Zhu Meng’s face suddenly transformed into gossamer threads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause he had caught sight of someone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone suddenly appeared from within the darkness, like the specter of a butterfly in a dream, her face covered with fine gauze, wearing a dancer’s outfit as sheer as a cicada’s wing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dancing outfit fluttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhu Meng shed no tears, because he had none.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven his hot, righteous blood had run dry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew it was not Die Wu, but her dancing had led him into the fantasy of a butterfly. It seemed to be real and not real. It seemed to be a fantasy and not a fantasy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was it: real or fantasy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if it was real? What if it was a fantasy? Life is so temporary, and emotions are so important; is there really a need to take things so seriously?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet it go! Let everything go! Go with the butterfly. That is the best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe knew that right now, anyone could draw a sword and lop off his head, but he didn’t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was already prepared to give up everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Sima Chaoqun wouldn’t allow him to. The song was still being sung, the dancer still danced. Sima Chaoqun pounced forward like a cat, ready to destroy the butterfly with its sharp claws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe dancer did not try to flee, but instead stepped forward. She used an indescribably graceful dancing movement to move forward, sidestepping his attack. And then she suddenly whispered two words into his ear. No one could hear these two words, but everyone could see Sima Chaoqun’s reaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tong tong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese were the two words she had spoken. Two words that had no meaning at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tong tong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyone that heard these two words would have no reaction whatsoever. But to Sima Chaoqun, it seemed these two words were like lightning striking from mid-air.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an instant, he became motionless. His limbs grew stiff, and his eyes filled with shock and dread. He took two involuntary steps backwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tong tong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two words seemed to be some type of magical spell that in the twinkling of an eye had absorbed Sima Chaoqun’s soul.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow could this be?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho was this unknown woman, this dancer who came from nowhere? How could these two seemingly completely meaningless words make Sima Chaoqun act in this way?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one could offer an explanation. But, there was something else that could be seen by anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—Sima Chaoqun and Zhu Meng were finished. Their heads could be taken by anyone at any time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe blind, white-haired old man could see nothing, but the sound of his playing already contained a feeling of desolation and harshness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere suddenly existed an impermeable killing air. Even the lamplight seemed to have become pallid and wretched. It shone on the pale faces of Sima and Zhu Meng, as well as the sword gripped in the hand of Gongsun Baojian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis sword would soon unsheathe, and a head would soon fall to the ground. Within the wretched lamplight, something flashed. Within the flickering lamplight suddenly shone forth a radiance even more tragic than what had shone before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt shone for a moment and then disappeared. A sword pierced a chest and then disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongsun Baojian’s sword was still sheathed. It had been knocked to the ground by another sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis new sword had not flown down from heaven, but had stabbed forth along with a flying person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe person and the sword had appeared so quickly, it was as if they were one entity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHad the sword stabbed forth with the flying person? Or had the person flown forth with the stabbing sword?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one could distinguish this point; no one could see clearly what had happened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut everyone could clearly see the person.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first sight, it appeared to be a young version of Sima Chaoqun; dashing, tall, elegant, powerful. He wore a colorful, well-tailored set of clothing, cut from the finest cloth. His eyes shone with confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first sight, no one could possibly realize that this was the once down-and-out, nameless Jianghu swordsman, Gao Jianfei.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart 2\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music had stopped. The dancing had stopped. The dancer lay curled up on the ground, as if unwilling to lift her head to see the blood of the dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao held his unsheathed sword. No traces of blood could be seen on the long, beautiful blade, only tear stains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongsun Qi’er stared amazedly at this person and his sword. Even though he already held the rod in his hand in a spear-like attack position, he was not brave enough to strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhu Meng and Sima Chaoqun still stood there dumbly, as if they hadn’t seen anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongsun Qi’er suddenly shouted, “Where is everyone? Are you all dead? Why don’t you come out?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom beyond the lights came a soft voice: “You’re right. All your men are dead. The people holding the lanterns now are mine.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA person stepped out casually from the darkness. He was dressed magnificently, with a violet marten coat. He held his hands clasped behind his back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongsun Qi’er’s facial expression changed. “Zhuo Donglai. It’s you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. Of course it’s me,” he said casually. “Only I would be able to use your own methods to deal with you. Zhu Meng’s men are all dead, and so are yours. The method you planned to use to kill people, I use to kill you.” He smiled. “You should know that I always do things extremely fairly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGongsun Qi’er suddenly shot forward. His long rod stabbed toward Zhuo Donglai’s face like a red phoenix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe staff flew forward. But it had already left his hands. He flipped backwards, flying into the air like a sparrow hawk, fleeing from the light toward the unseeable darkness. His reaction was very fast, his ability to adapt to the situation quite formidable. It was the essence and accumulation of a lifetime of experience in martial arts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut sadly he was just a little bit too slow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as his body flitted into the air, he saw the dazzling aura of a sword flying up like a rainbow. In an instant, it was in front of him, the shocking coldness of the aura so bright that he couldn’t open his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time he was able to open his eyes, he could not see the sword aura any more. All he could see was a sword hilt, protruding from his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as his body collapsed to the ground like a stone, he stared at the sword hilt in shock and terror. It was as if he couldn’t understand how a sword hilt could be protruding from his chest. And yet, he definitely knew where the blade of the sword was.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA flying sword, a deadly attack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Such a fast sword. Such a fast move!” Zhuo Donglai bowed and raised his clasped hands respectfully toward Little Gao. “Based merely on the might of this sword, you are already qualified to lead the Great Protection Agency.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Lead the Great Protection Agency?” It seemed has if Zhu Meng had just been pulled out of a dream. He slowly turned around, staring at Little Gao with eyes that seemed about to burst from his eye sockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You lead the Great Protection Agency?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao said nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. Very good, Gao Jianfei.” Zhu Meng laughed. “It seems you’re already gradually flying up.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis laughter cracked. “If you’ve come to take the head off my neck, then by all means take it.” Zhu Meng laughed hoarsely. “I’ve wanted to give it to you all this time. More than anyone else.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eXiao Gao didn’t laugh, and seemed to have no reaction whatsoever. In these few days, he had trained himself to become like a rock. His face was devoid of even the slightest expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why are you here?” shouted Zhu Meng. “What are you waiting for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m in no hurry,” said Little Gao calmly. “Why are you? If I’m willing to wait, so should you.” He suddenly turned and faced Sima Chaoqun. “You should be even more aware what I’m waiting for.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA long time passed, and then Sima Chaoqun raised his head. It was as if this was his first time seeing Little Gao, as if he had already forgotten everything and everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore time passed. Finally, in a very strange tone of voice, he asked Little Gao, “What are you waiting for?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m waiting to settle accounts with you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Good. Very good.” His voice seemed to be filled with an unspeakable sadness. “It’s time to settle accounts. What people owe me, what I owe people, it must all be settled.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Considering your current situation, I shouldn’t force you to make a move,” said Little Gao coldly. “But when you defeated me last time, my situation wasn’t much better.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSima Chaoqun suddenly laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I never blamed you, there’s no reason to say so much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hold on,” Zhu Meng suddenly shouted. “Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten our agreement?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSima Chaoqun’s face sank. “You’d best step back a bit. This is between me and Gao Jianfei. If anyone get between us, I will be forced to end my life.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai let out a soft sigh. “When heroes reach the end of the road, they are still heroes. Clan Leader Zhu, you also are a hero of the age. You should understand him. Why let the reputation of another hero be dragged into the dust?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn’t cast another glance at Zhu Meng, but instead walked forward and pulled the sword out of Gongsun Qi’er’s chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no blood on the sword, only tear stains. He gripped the blade of the sword between his thumb and forefinger and handed it hilt-first to Gao Jianfei.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your sword.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao didn’t take it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know it’s my sword. But I also know that he has no sword.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He doesn’t. But you do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao laughed. “Correct. He doesn’t, but I do. It seems that’s the current situation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai calmly said, “There are many things in the world that end up like this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I understand,” said Little Gao. “I completely understand.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finally reached out and took the sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this moment, the smile disappeared from his face, replaced by a murderous look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn that moment, he stabbed forward with the sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tip had been less than an inch from Zhuo Donglai’s chest, and was pointed straight at his heart. He had used his own hand to grip the blade and hand it over. This was a mistake that could not be made. People who made this type of mistake ended up dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai couldn’t be an exception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder these circumstances, he had no way to escape or defend himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGao Jianfei had been waiting, waiting for just this type of opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis eyes were fixed on Zhuo Donglai’s face, because everything he had done had been in preparation for his split second.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe time when the tip of his sword would pierce Zhuo Donglai’s heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—In this split second, what was the expression on Zhuo Donglai’s face?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was none. Because he had already predicted everything that could happen. His body moved backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe power of the sword did not cease, it continued to stab forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd he continued to move backward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePower, unceasing energy, completely filled the sword.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe continued to retreat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still clasped the sword tip between his two fingers, and it was still the same distance from his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao stopped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSweat drenched his clothes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai looked at him coldly. In an exceedingly warm and quiet voice, he said, “You really went to a lot of trouble this time. It took a lot of scheming to gain this opportunity, a lot of effort. You did very well. I really should let you kill me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis voice contained no trace of sarcasm, because he was simply stating the facts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But you should know that killing someone like me isn’t an easy matter. I can’t let you succeed so easily. Otherwise, killing me would be meaningless.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGao Jianfei listened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe only listened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the moment, everyone had no choice but to listen to Zhuo Donglai. Other than him, who was there that could say anything?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then he said something that left everyone shocked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you kill me, then your death is also certain. If your sword stabs me in the chest, then in that instant, your death is fixed. You might even die faster than me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai seldom told lies, but this time what he said was hard to believe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao couldn’t hold back from asking: “You’re saying that if I stabbed you with my sword, my death would be faster than yours?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I know that in the world there are at least 5 types of hidden weapons that can truly seal the throat and kill someone in an instant. And there are at least three people in Jianghu who use those types of weapons.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And the most important point of all is that I happen to know that one of those people is here, and one of those weapons is pointed straight at your back. If you stab me, it would be a very exciting moment, and you would be extremely proud of yourself. In that situation, it would be difficult for anyone to avoid being distracted. You’re no exception.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was a fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At that moment when you were the most happy and proud, you would suddenly feel a prick on your back like the bite of an insect. Then you would fall down, and as you fell, your heart would stop, and you would be dead.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCold sweat poured down Little Gao’s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai casually continued, “But you can relax. Because I’m not dead, and for the moment you don’t dare to make a move. Because that person is like me, never willing to do anything unless 100% confident of success.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who is this person?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If you want to know who it is, then you first need to realize three things.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What three things?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“First, how did the Gongsun brothers gain foreknowledge? How did they find out five days ago that there would be such huge changes in the Great Protection Agency? How did they arrive here so promptly? Second, this dancer, her face covered in gauze… where did she come from? Just now, Sima Chaoqun was going to kill her to protect Zhu Meng. Why did he suddenly retreat after hearing her say two words? Why did he suddenly change?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao couldn’t figure out either of these two things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually, these two matters are actually one in the same,” he said, providing somewhat of a hint. “Similar to the way that some rooms have two doors, but one key to open them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao laughed bitterly. “Unfortunately, I don’t have the key. And I don’t know where to find it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Keys are usually held by living people. Dead people don’t need keys. But as for this key,” he said coolly, “it wouldn’t hurt to look on the body of a dead person.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Which dead person?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The Gongsun brothers have no gift of foreknowledge. For them to arrive promptly was because someone asked them to come. But,” he asked, “who is it that, five days ago, could possibly predict that the thirty years of friendship between Sima and I would be destroyed in an instant?” He answered his own question. “Only one person. Our falling out was because of one person.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“A dead person?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. This person should be dead,” said Zhuo Donglai. “She knew that after she died, Sima would not let me go. Because when she was alive, she had already placed a poisoned dagger between Sima and I.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao’s eyes suddenly flickered, and he asked, “A woman could disguise another woman as herself. But could she really fool her own husband?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If she was alive, she couldn’t,” said Zhuo Donglai. “But after a few days of death, the situation would be different. After a person has been dead for a few days, the muscles become twisted and hard. The facial features change. And if she hung herself, the changes would be even greater, more horrible. Anyone would be fooled.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao sighed. “If someone returns home to find that his wife and children had all died tragic deaths, he would most likely be unable to see anything clearly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne word at a time, Zhuo Donglai asked, “And if he suddenly found out his wife wasn’t dead, how might he change?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He would probably become a completely different person.” Little Gao let out another long sigh. “But why?

What fear do they find in death? As of today I, Zhu Meng, finally understand.” His laughter gradually faded. “Gao Jianfei, to have made friends with a person like you, I can die without regret. But you’re still young. It’s not worth it for you to risk your life for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving said this, he used the tip of his foot to flip up Gongsun Baojian’s sword. His hand shot out to grab it, and then his arm twisted toward the back of his neck. By exerting a bit of power, his head would fall to the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Little Gao had already grabbed his arm with one hand, and the blade of the sword with the other. A dinging sound rang out, and the sword blade snapped off the hilt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why won’t you let me die?” Zhu Meng said harshly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why do you want to die?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“So that you can live,” said Zhu Meng. “I should already be dead. Once I’m dead, there’s no need for you to risk your life by going up against Zhuo Donglai. I can die a worthy death, without regret. I can die knowing my life was worth living.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’re wrong,” said Gao Jianfei. “Your life or death has nothing to do with the battle to be fought today.

And if I’m able to kill him, he won’t live to see sunrise.” He grasped Zhu Meng’s arm. “Those two sentences you just uttered were incorrect. True men are born into the world, and they must live. They must live happily. When they die, their death must have value. If you die now, you’re just delivering up your life along with mine, and your death will not be worth a copper coin.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai suddenly laughed. “He’s correct. If you wait until he’s dead, it won’t be too late for you to die as well. Why be so anxious to throw away your life? Do you think I will offer you my thanks if you do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhu Meng’s hand relaxed, but Little Gao gripped it even more tightly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If I live through today,” said Little Gao, “I’ll not only help you revive the Lion Clan, but I will reform the Great Protection Agency.

As long as we are still living, there’s no need to say the word ‘death’ so lightly.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhuo Donglai let out a sigh. “He’s correct again. If you are alive, why die? Why look down upon your own life?” With another sigh, he continued, “Unfortunately, when the time has arrived for one to die, then death truly is difficult to avoid. There are no exceptions.” He looked at Little Gao, his pupils already constricted. “As of now, the time of your death has arrived. Because, you made another mistake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What mistake?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You shouldn\u0027t have broken that sword.

Could it be that the father he had never laid eyes on was none other than the Grandmaster? And therefore, when he was slain by the sword, the tear stains disappeared?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—Or was it that the utterances of gods and ghosts were untrustworthy, and the tear stains had disappeared merely because their time had expired?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo one could answer these questions, except perhaps the old man in the pavilion. But he was dead, slain by Zhuo Donglai himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps the question Xiao Leixue had wished to ask the old man was this question.

Zhuo Donglai’s corpse and the weapon were also gone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZhu Meng said, “Mr. Xiao left already. He took Zhuo Donglai with him.” His heart was also filled with shock and uncertainty. “What is going on?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLittle Gao stared off into the distance. Clear skies abounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It doesn’t really matter,” said Little Gao. “From today on, we most likely will never see Mr. Xiao again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe lantern lights had been extinguished, and those carrying them had dispersed. The only person left was the young blind girl with the pipa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSunlight illuminated heaven and earth, but her eyes could only see sheets of darkness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGao Jianfei’s heart suddenly filled with an unspeakable pain.

Do you have any relatives there?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little girl said nothing. She just held the pipa tightly, like a drowning person holding tightly to a piece of driftwood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—Could it be that the only thing that existed in her life was her pipa?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where are you going to go?” asked Little Gao. “What are you going to do?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven as he asked the question, he regretted it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis type of question should not be asked.

How would you, dear reader, expect her to answer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho could ever imagine that this young girl, fated to live her whole life in darkness, would suddenly respond in a bright voice, “I want to keep on singing.

Sing until we die.” The singing of the singer, the dancing of the dancer, the sword of the swordsman, the pen of the scholar, the fighting spirit of the hero… as long as life exists, these things will never be cast aside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shining sun rose, the snows had melted.

After his explanation, the technique sounds pretty cool. But in Chinese, when he first says it, it makes it sound something like “Crappy Sword technique.” The word 破 po has multiple meanings, and thus the reason that Gao Jianfei doesn’t understand at first. It’s an intentionally clever use of words.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ca href\u003d\"/novel/heros-shed-no-tears/hsnt-chapter-17\" class\u003d\"chapter-nav\"\u003e Previous Chapter \u003c/a\u003e","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/heros-shed-no-tears/hsnt-chapter-18","bookId":1504,"creation":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:34 AM","modification":"Sep 10, 2019 4:32:34 AM"}
