She had to be on track. And that was what she was counting on today. Little more than her instinct.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDetermined and certain as she was, Helen hadn’t been foolish enough to pull the Feds and local cops from other potential targets … but she’d chosen to come to Detroit to oversee because it had to be here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the help of Dr. Everett, on-staff geologists had determined that the controller must be within ten miles of the explosion detonation; yet, he wouldn’t want to be too close, or he’d be caught in the destruction. So, the bomb experts and the geologists had done some rough calculating and pinpointed an outer radius of two miles wide where the searches were contained—at all three locations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree hundred law enforcement officials combed the areas; checking cars, buildings, shops; everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomeone had to find something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe tingling in her fingers told Helen it was a matter of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe just hoped that time would come in the next eighty minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt that moment, Colin Bergstrom ran up to her “Helen!” he shouted. “I’ve got them! MacNeil!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tell me it’s Detroit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s Detroit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe almost grinned, but there was no time. Hope, now, yes, but no time. “What else?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He called from his sat phone. I could barely hear him but he told me he and Marina Alexander were with the Skaladeskas.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What else? Do they know how to stop this?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“He said they moved up the time. Forty minutes from now. We lost connection, but I know he will try and call back.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Forty minutes? Do they know how to stop this? Get him on the damned phone!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrustration crawled into her belly, gnawed there. It was close … so close. Gabe was still alive and on the job. And there was even someone who might be able to help them … .might. But couldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Get him back on the phone. See if he knows anything!” She stalked away, ignoring the fact that she’d just snapped orders to a senior CIA director.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn’t care, because the tingling in her fingers was beginning to wane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-44-\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they hurried along the hall, as quickly as Gabe could move, Marina felt the desperation climbing inside her. “Give me the phone. We need to try and get through again. I have some information that will help—” She wanted to scream in frustration; it took too long to get the words out. “Dial Bergstrom. I hope to God he’s in Detroit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe handed her the phone. The ring sounded tinny and far away, but when the voice boomed on the line, it came through loud and clear. “MacNeil?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is Marina Alexander. Are you in Detroit?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The man who is going to detonate the bombs—I can tell you where he is. You have to pick him up and get the box.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Wait.” There was silence, a scuffle, and then a female voice came on. “Helen Darrow speaking. Gabe? Am I to understand you’re with the Skaladeskas?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is Marina. Yes. The man you want, who has the control, is in Windsor. He’s across the river from Detroit, directly across from the RenCen. You have about twenty minutes to apprehend him and for me to give you the code to stop it. If I can get to it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In Windsor? Jesus, God, we hardly have anyone over there—” Darrow’s voice stopped abruptly, and Marina could hear her shouting orders, and the bumps as she moved herself, obviously running.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Helen! Listen,” she yelled into the phone. “Before we cut out again—he’s got dark hair and he’s wearing a blue shirt with green stripes, and he’s right by the river. I couldn’t see if there was a vehicle—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone bleeped in her ear, and Marina knew it had cut out. She pulled it away and looked to see how many battery lines were left. One.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next time she called, they had to have the man, and she had to have the code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turned to look at Gabe, who had a bad look on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What is it?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ve only got one bullet left.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let’s hope we don’t even need that one.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were at the door of Command Central. Marina looked at Gabe. He had a grim look on his grayish face; she wondered how much longer he could go on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might not be an issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe held up his fingers: three, two, one—he slammed his good shoulder into the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn’t move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’ve secured it somehow. How did they know?” Marina wanted to scream. She remembered that Varden had insisted she go to the toilet. Maybe that had been his way of getting rid of her and Victor so there wouldn’t be any interference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow was it locked? None of the other doors … ..Marina saw the faint outline of a panel door. Jabbing at it with her poor fingernails, she managed to slide it open and display the now-familiar tongue-tabs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only way in was with Aleksandrov DNA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps this would be the only time Marina was glad she carried those genes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe took a tab, stuck it on her tongue to moisten it, then fed it into the slot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe little machine grabbed it, and Marina waited, clutching Gabe’s wrist, hoping she had enough Aleksandrov that it would recognize her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, miraculously, the door moved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey were through the entrance before it was more than two feet wide, surprising the group at the computer table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe brandished the gun. “Freeze. Now move slowly to the right. Marina, get the code.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Varden and Roman were out of reaching distance, Marina sprinted into the room and snatched the green plastic sheet from the computer control area. She ran back to Gabe as he stood, holding the gun steadily on the group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll never make it in time,” Varden told them. His words were general, but his eyes fastened on Marina. Again, she felt as if he were trying to tell her something … something subtle. He stared at her … was that the slightest of nods? “Nice try though. You’ve got brains and nerve, as well as good looks.” Even now, his voice was mocking. But he’d given the barest incline of his head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe grabbed Marina’s arm—partly, she thought, to help him stay on his feet, and partly to show their solidarity. “Wish we could stay and join your little victory party, but I don’t think there’s going to be one. I’m going to suggest that you not move for a moment while we make a phone call.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarina took the phone and pushed the redial button while Gabe focused the gun on Roman, who, despite his supposed fear of firearms seemed ready to bolt. Which was greater, Marina thought, waiting for the phone to connect: his fear of guns or his fear of failure?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phone connected and Helen Darrow’s voice blared through. “We’ve got it. Do you have him?” Marina asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Not yet. Ambassador Bridge was too crowded; almost there though. You got the code?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes. Write this down,” Marina began, starting to translate the code, which was written out in Skaladeska prose. “Green to the left—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRoman and Varden moved at the same time, splitting, and Gabe fired reflexively at Varden as he shouted, “Run Marina!” He whirled, slamming the gun at Roman’s face when he threw himself toward them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarina didn’t need to be told twice, but she yanked Gabe after her and pounded the button to close the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey tore down the hallway, and the sound of shouts blared after them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGabe wouldn’t make it far; they needed to stop and finish the phone call—how much time did they have left?—they’d never make it safely out of there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe jumble of thoughts crammed in her head galvanized Marina to run faster, pulling Gabe along after her. Their pursuers couldn’t be far behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs they rounded the corner, Victor appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarina readied herself to push past him, mow him down if she had to … and at the last minute, she changed her mind. Grabbed his arm. He was going to step up this time. “Get us out of here,” she said, close to his face. “Or I will shoot you. I’ve got nothing to lose.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe blanched, but gave a short nod, his Adam’s apple echoing it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGasping for breath, she looked at Gabe. He was fading fast.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCould she trust her father? Even with a gun pointing at him?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe looked at him, knowing she didn’t have any time … .but what did her instincts say? Could she trust the man who’d lied to her for as long as she remembered? The man who’d never put anyone ahead of himself? The man who would have let Gabe die?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe had to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Help me with him,” she told Victor, still pointing the gun at him. “How far?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not far.” He gave her an enigmatic look. “I did mean to give you the gun.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come on. Get us out of here.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looped one thin arm around Gabe, and it was ludicrous to think that he’d be of any help … but between him and Marina, they managed to move the three of them quickly down a passage that blended so well into the wall that Marina would never have found it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe felt the time ticking away, and she chafed. But they couldn’t stop. The voices and pounding feet were too close behind; getting closer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey couldn’t stop yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuddenly, they were at a door, and Victor was pulling a tongue-tab from a small panel. He licked it, and fed it into the machine, and the door opened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAir. Fresh air. The grey light of midnight during an Arctic summer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe became aware of a screaming alarm; a siren blaring a warning. One look at Victor—for she’d ceased to think of him as Dad—told her he was responsible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe would not look at her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarina pulled Gabe through the door, and found herself on a small hill, covered with tufts of brown-green grass. Four tall pines stood like sentinels over looking the steppes below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarina grabbed Gabe’s arm, trying not to think about what time it was back in Detroit, and ran. As if he, too, was spurred on by the fresh air, he picked up speed and kept up with her as they dashed over the uneven ground. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/siberian-treasure/page-47.html","bookId":2353,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:32 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:03:32 AM"}
