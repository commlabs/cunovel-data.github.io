He was a cautious, careful, trustworthy man, whose reputation was deservedly high.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Grafton and Ben, stepping out of the elevator, paused before the door of Mr. Codicil\u0027s office for a moment, when the former opened the door and entered.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You may sit down here, Philip, while I go in and speak to Mr. Codicil,\" said Mr. Grafton, indicating a chair near the door.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [82]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I wish he wouldn\u0027t call me Philip,\" thought Ben. \"I like my own name much better.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n He did not complain aloud, however, for he felt that his salary was liberal enough to compensate him for some slight sacrifice of feeling.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Good morning, Mr. Grafton,\" said the lawyer, advancing to meet his visitor.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Good morning, Mr. Codicil; I am glad to find you in, for I\u0027ve made quite an effort to reach your office at an early hour. You observe I have brought the boy with me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n The sharp eyes of the lawyer had not failed to note the presence of Ben.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You observe that he is in excellent health, despite all reports to the contrary.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"So it appears,\" said the lawyer. \"He seems to have lost all resemblance to the family.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do you think so?\" said Grafton, carelessly. \"Opinions differ about that. For my own part, I can see the resemblance plainly.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"How old is he now?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Sixteen.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [83]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have not seen him since he was four years of age.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Twelve years effect many changes.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Very true.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And now, Mr. Codicil, as I have another engagement very soon, if you can conveniently attend to our little business at onceâ€”\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Certainly, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Codicil prepared a receipt which he requested Mr. Grafton to sign. He then opened a check-book and filled a check for a large amount, which he handed to his visitor. The latter pocketed it with evident satisfaction.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I hope, Mr. Codicil, you are not disappointed to know that the boy is still alive?\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Heaven knows that I wish no harm to the lad!\" said the lawyer, warmly. \"Yet, when I consider how his poor cousins are compelled to struggle for a living, I cannot help regretting the injustice of old John Portland\u0027s will, which maintains one grandchild in luxury, while three others, having equal natural claims, should be thrown on the cold mercies of the world.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [84]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, to be sure!\" said Richard Grafton, carelessly. \"Still a man\u0027s last will and testament must be respected. A man can do as he likes with his own.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"True, in the eyes of the law. Morally, there would be no harm in your young ward doing something for his poor cousins. They would like to meet him and make his acquaintance.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am afraid it won\u0027t be possible. We remain in the city but a short time,\" said Mr. Grafton, hastily.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Where do you go?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I have not quite decided whether to take a trip to the Pacific coast or to return to Europe. Of course I shall apprise you promptly when I have made my decision.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Your ward is an American. Is it right to rear him in Europe, leaving him without any adequate knowledge of his own country?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He will have advantages abroad which he would not have in his own country. However, I will consider what you have said, and I may arrange to spend a part of each year in America.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [85]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I would like to speak to Philip,\" said Mr. Codicil.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Richard Grafton hesitated, but only for a moment. He was playing a bold game for a large stake. It would not do to be timid.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Come here, Philip,\" he said, \"Mr. Codicil wishes to speak to you.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ben rose and advanced to meet the lawyer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I am glad to make your acquaintance, sir,\" he said.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"And I am pleased to meet you, my boy. You look well!\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, sir; I always enjoy good health.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Codicil looked a little surprised, but he regarded with approval the boy\u0027s bright face and manly figure.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"He is certainly a very attractive boy,\" thought the lawyer. \"I haven\u0027t much confidence in his guardian, but the boy doesn\u0027t appear to be spoiled.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Come, Philip. I am afraid I must hurry you away,\" said Mr. Grafton, \"as I have another visit to pay.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ben shook hands with the lawyer and went out of his office.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n [86]\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I cannot help distrusting that man,\" said Mr. Codicil, as the door closed. \"I believe him to be a trickster. I wish the boy were under better influences.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Ben had been at such a distance from the inner office that he had not heard or understood the conversation between his employer and Mr. Codicil, yet it seemed to him singular that he should have received so much attention from the lawyer.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I suppose Mr. Grafton was speaking to him about me,\" said he to himself.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n When they reached the street Mr. Grafton said:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Philip, I shall not require your company any longer this morning. If you have any plans of your own you are quite at liberty to follow them. Have you all the money you need?\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Yes, sir; you gave me fifteen dollars yesterday.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I remember. Very well; you can go where you please. We will meet at the hotel at one o\u0027clock.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Would you object, Mr. Grafton, to my [87] sending five dollars to my mother? I shall have enough left for myself.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Do as you like. You may send ten dollars if you like. When you are out of money you have only to apply to me.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You are very kind, sir,\" said Ben, gratefully.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"It is on account of your first month\u0027s wages, you know.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Then he paused a moment, regarding Ben with some apparent solicitude.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"By the way,\" he said, \"I must guard you against saying too much about me or your relation with me. I have a great dislike to have myself or my affairs talked about.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will remember, sir.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"You need not mention that I have desired you to bear a different name from your own.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I will not mention it, sir, if you object.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"With me it is a matter of sentiment,\" said Mr. Grafton in a low voice. \"I had a dear son named Philip. He died, and left me alone in the world. You resemble him. It is pleasant to me to call some one by his [88] name, yet I cannot bear to excite the curiosity of a cold, unsympathizing world, and be forced to make to them an explanation which will harrow up my feelings and recall to me my bitter loss.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I quite understand you, Mr. Grafton,\" said Ben, with quiet sympathy. \"Though I would prefer to be called by my own name, I am glad if I can help make up to you for your loss.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"Enough, my boy! I felt that I had judged you aright. Now go where you please. Only try to be back at the hotel at one o\u0027clock.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n As Ben walked away Richard Grafton said to himself, in a tone of self-congratulation:\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n \"I might have sought far and wide without finding a boy that would suit my purpose as well as this one. Codicil, as shrewd as he thinks himself, was quite taken in. I confess I looked forward to the interview with dread. Had I allowed the boy to be closely questioned all would have come out, and I would have lost the handsome income which I receive as his guardian. While the real Philip [89] Grafton sleeps in his foreign grave, his substitute will answer my purpose, and insure me ease and comfort. But it won\u0027t do to remain in New York. There are too many chances of discovery. I must put the sea between me and the lynx-eyed sharpness of old Codicil.\"\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e\n Mr. Grafton\u0027s urgent business engagement was at the Park Bank, where he got his check cashed. He next proceeded to the office of the Cunard Steamship Company, and engaged passage for the next Saturday for Richard Grafton and Master Philip Grafton.\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2945/80908.html","bookId":467,"creation":"Aug 11, 2019 4:52:45 AM","modification":"Aug 11, 2019 4:52:45 AM"}
