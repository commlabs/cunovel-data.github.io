The kings on either part take the solemn oath for the conditions of the combat. The duel ensues; wherein Paris being overcome, he is snatched away in a cloud by Venus, and transported to his apartment. She then calls Helen from the walls, and brings the lovers together.

softer moments let delights employ,\n\u003cbr\u003e And kind embraces snatch the hasty joy.\n\u003cbr\u003e Not thus I loved thee, when from Sparta\u0027s shore\n\u003cbr\u003e My forced, my willing heavenly prize I bore,\n\u003cbr\u003e When first entranced in Cranae\u0027s isle I lay,124\n\u003cbr\u003e Mix\u0027d with thy soul, and all dissolved away!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e Thus having spoke, the enamour\u0027d Phrygian boy\n\u003cbr\u003e Rush\u0027d to the bed, impatient for the joy.\n\u003cbr\u003e Him Helen follow\u0027d slow with bashful charms,\n\u003cbr\u003e And clasp\u0027d the blooming hero in her arms.\n\u003cbr\u003e While these to love\u0027s delicious rapture yield,\n\u003cbr\u003e The stern Atrides rages round the field:\n\u003cbr\u003e So some fell lion whom the woods obey,\n\u003cbr\u003e Roars through the desert, and demands his prey.\n\u003cbr\u003e Paris he seeks, impatient to destroy,\n\u003cbr\u003e But seeks in vain along the troops of Troy;\n\u003cbr\u003e Even those had yielded to a foe so brave\n\u003cbr\u003e The recreant warrior, hateful as the grave.\n\u003cbr\u003e Then speaking thus, the king of kings arose,\n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ye Trojans, Dardans, all our generous foes!\n\u003cbr\u003e [pg 065]\n\u003cbr\u003e Hear and attest! from Heaven with conquest crown\u0027d,\n\u003cbr\u003e Our brother\u0027s arms the just success have

And age to age record this signal day.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e He ceased; his army\u0027s loud applauses rise,\n\u003cbr\u003e And the long shout runs echoing through the skies.\n\u003cbr
