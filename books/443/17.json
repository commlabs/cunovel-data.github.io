{"id":12412,"no":17,"title":"Chapter 17","content":"Arno Sturani, otherwise \"Barbarossa,\" answered Jack\u0027s note and invited him to call at his house in the evening.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack visited Evers\u0027 shop as a preliminary, and he was obliged to go in the afternoon before closing hours. He dispatched Bobo to dine with Mrs. Cleaver and Miriam. While Bobo could hardly be said to be safe in that company, still it was some satisfaction to Jack to know where he was.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The astute little wig-maker and his wife, the retired ballet-dancer, greeted Jack like an old and valued customer. Old-fashioned shop-keepers have this art.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Everything going well?\" asked Mr. Evers.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Splendidly!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That little job I did for you; has it served its turn?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Couldn\u0027t have been better.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What do you require to-day?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"A fresh make-up for another purpose.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ah! Come back into one of the dressing-rooms.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Evers was distressed to learn that Jack had put himself out to get to the shop before closing time.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You can make an appointment by \u0027phone for any hour of the day or night,\" he said. \"Of course it would be too conspicuous for me to let you in and out of the shop after closing hours, but my apartment is upstairs. Come there any time, and we can get what we need out of the shop.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack thanked him. \"This time,\" he said, \"I want to look like a mere lad, a poor boy in cheap worn clothes, but a student, a highbrow, full of wild, anarchistic ideas.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Anarchistic?\" said Mr. Evers, elevating the scant eyebrows. \"Are you going into that kind of society?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Temporarily.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Beware! I know nothing about such people, but I am told they are like wild beasts. Curious, isn\u0027t it, how they run to hair? Disturbs all my theories. Such beards! Such tangled, flowing locks. How is it that men so unbalanced are thus favored?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Jack, smiling. \"Perhaps they don\u0027t have any more than other men to start with, but spare the scissors and the razor.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ve taken that into account. Even so, you never heard of a bald anarchist, did you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack admitted that he had not. \"Perhaps I can give you some first-hand information later,\" he added.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mr. Evers said he would be glad of it.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Now let me see as to your make-up,\" he went on. \"Your luxuriant hair will now come in handy. Let it fall over your eyes so. A pair of thick glasses this time to make you look short-sighted. I have a pair specially made with lenses of clear glass let in to enable you to see where you are going. Clothes are the principal item. I think I have just what you require.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"It\u0027s no trouble for me to make you look like a youth who might frequent such company,\" he said, \"but the question is, can you keep up the character once you get there? I am told those people talk a strange jargon of phrases that the uninitiated cannot understand.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ve been boning up on their literature,\" said Jack. \"I think I can keep my end up.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Ah, I see I am not dealing with a tyro,\" said Mr. Evers with a flattering air of respect.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack dined at an humble little restaurant on the East Side, such as befitted his new condition, and afterwards presented himself at the address on East Broadway furnished by Sturani\u0027s letter. It was one of those plain old-fashioned dwellings common in the neighborhood. They are occupied by the elite of the East Side; that is to say, doctors, lawyers, politicians, who still find it profitable to live among their clients and constituents.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Barbarossa\u0027s house was a combination of residence, school and club. On a brass plate beside the door was the legend: \"Sturani School of Social Science.\" A youth, much the same as the one who had sold him books, let Jack in, and after favoring him with a hard stare, led him to a small room at the back and told him to wait. The house seemed to be full of Barbarossa\u0027s disciples. Jack had glimpses of groups in the unfurnished parlors, arguing with fury.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack had learned that Barbarossa\u0027s position among anarchists corresponded in a way with the description of himself which the mysterious Mr. B. had furnished Anderson, and he naturally inferred that Barbarossa might be another alias of Mr. B.\u0027s. His heart beat fast with excitement as he waited for him, thinking that he was perhaps about to come face to face with his real adversary.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e But when the redoubtable Barbarossa plunged into the room, Jack was speedily disillusioned of his hopes. Plunged is the only word to use: the anarchist\u0027s movements were like those of a frolicking mastiff—only Barbarossa always affected an air of weighty import. He was enormously fat, and it was genuine fat, as Jack could tell by the shake and sag of him as he flung himself into a chair. By no stretch could he have transformed himself into the neat, decent little gentleman so often described to Jack. This was not Mr. B.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Moreover, Barbarossa had a mass of red hair standing on end around his head like a halo, and a spreading red beard. These were indubitably real, too, and had obviously taken years to produce.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"You\u0027re Cassels,\" grunted Barbarossa.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Humph! English!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"English descent, sir.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"We don\u0027t get many English boys interested in ideas.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack privately hoped this would not count against him. He had considered assuming a foreign character, but had given it up as being too difficult to maintain.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What do you want of me?\" demanded Barbarossa.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I want to learn,\" said Jack. \"I want to meet men with ideas. I want to take part in the movement.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Have you any money?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack was somewhat taken aback. \"A little. I\u0027m only a working-boy.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"If you can pay, you can come to my school. It\u0027s fifteen dollars payable in advance. Afternoon or evening classes. You can come as often as you want.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I\u0027ll come,\" said Jack. \"I\u0027ll bring the money to-morrow. Is there some work I could do, too? For the Cause. Can I belong to a circle?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Circle?\" said Barbarossa with a sharp glance of his little blue eyes—they were at once irascible and short-sighted, eyes of a fanatic. \"What kind of a circle?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Liberators.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about. If there is any such thing, I suppose you\u0027ll be invited to belong when you\u0027ve proved yourself worthy. Come to my school and I\u0027ll put some ideas into your head if it\u0027s not too English.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Thank you, sir,\" said Jack rising. This was as far as he supposed he could get on the first meeting.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"By the way, who told you about me?\" demanded Barbarossa.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I read your articles in the Future Age.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, then, who told you about the Future Age?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack was tempted to try an experiment. \"Fellow I used to room with. The hero who croaked old Silas Gyde. Emil Jansen.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e It had an electrical effect. Barbarossa was out of his chair with a bound. His ruddy cheeks turned a gray color, on which the network of little dark veins stood out startlingly.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Silence! Don\u0027t speak that name here! Hero nothing! Madman! Fool! What have you got to do with him?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Why, nothing!\" stammered Jack, affecting a great confusion. \"Isn\u0027t he one of you? Isn\u0027t he working for the Cause?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I don\u0027t know him!\" cried Barbarossa. \"If he claims to be my friend I repudiate him! Such madmen are like to ruin us all!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"But—you said in your article that I read, that the capitalistic order must be overthrown at any cost. That he was a hero who gave up his life to accomplish it.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s all right in a periodical,\" said Barbarossa. \"They don\u0027t care what you write. But murder——!\" The fat man shuddered. \"I\u0027m a responsible citizen. I\u0027ve got a wife and four children to think of.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack thought: \"In anarchy, like other religions, there seems to be a considerable gap between preaching and practising.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What did Jansen tell you about me?\" demanded Barbarossa.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Nothing particular,\" said Jack. \"He just let on that he admired you, and was trying to live according to your teachings. He read me some out of a book he was writing. He dedicated it to you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"What!\" cried Barbarossa. \"In writing?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Yes, it was written down.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And the police searched his room! Oh, my God! I\u0027m done!\" He collapsed in his chair.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Jack looked at the collapsed mountain of flesh, and suppressed a smile. Not a very formidable object this.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Was it my right name, Sturani?\" Barbarossa asked anxiously.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"No. He had written: \u0027To Barbarossa.\u0027\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A little color returned to the big man\u0027s face. \"Oh, well, the police are stupid. Maybe they won\u0027t establish the connection. I expect I would have heard from them before this if they had. That\u0027s all, Cassels; you can go.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"And may I come to the school to-morrow?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Sure, if you bring the money.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e From a public booth, Jack telephoned Harmon Evers that he would be right up to change back to his proper person.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e On the way uptown he sought to digest what he had learned.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Barbarossa is certainly not the man I\u0027m looking for. Just the same, his fright makes it clear that he is at the head of some group that Emil Jansen belonged to. I must join that group. It\u0027s hardly possible that Barbarossa himself instigated the attack on Silas Gyde. He\u0027s only a paper anarchist. Somewhere back of him I\u0027ll find the cagy little \u0027Mr. B.\u0027 again. Lordy! This case lengthens out like a telescope!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well!\" said Mr. Evers, \"you\u0027re back early. Did you see any anarchists? How about their hair?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"The main guy of all had a bald spot as big as a saucer. Just a hedge of hair all around like the burning bush in bloom.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Well, I\u0027m relieved to hear that.\" \n\u003cbr type\u003d\"_moz\"\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2170/61352.html","bookId":443,"creation":"Aug 2, 2019 4:41:04 AM","modification":"Aug 2, 2019 4:41:04 AM"}
