{"id":94910,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI suck in my breath; the world seems to tilt for just a moment. “When?” I say as I exhale. “How?” In the silence it occurs to me that if she\u0027s traveled there then it must be close. It means that it exists and that I can go there as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tear the covers away and my legs tangle in the fabric, causing me to wince as the delicate scabs from the attack yesterday break open. I stumble forward but Travis makes no move to catch me. When I have my balance I rush to him at the window, take his arms in my hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don\u0027t you know what this means?” I say to him. My body feels light. Suddenly, I\u0027m the happiest I\u0027ve been since my mother died.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We can go there,” I tell him. “If she went there then we can go there as well.” I begin to pace, the energy boiling inside my veins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Did she tell you how far? Did she tell you how to get there?” I stop and walk over to face Travis, my chest barely brushing against his. “Did she tell you what it was like? About the waves? The smell?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis grasps my arms, pulling me in on myself and almost lifting me from the rough wood of the platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She told me it\u0027s dangerous, Mary!” I can see now that his chest is heaving, his breath fast, his face red and his jaw tight. He shakes me, just a little. “She told me it\u0027s dangerous,” he repeats in a softer voice. As if I would only understand if he continues to tell it to me over and over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI feel my own face pinch in confusion. “Dangerous how?” I ask. I pull my arms from his grasp and cross them over my chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“She told me that the Unconsecrated rise from the waters and still walk the beaches. That there\u0027s no way to fence it off— no way to protect yourself. She said pirates ravage the shores and no one could ever really be safe there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to protest, to tell him that he\u0027s wrong. But instead I look out the window to the trees, to the leaves undulating out in the Forest. The only ocean I\u0027ve ever known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It can\u0027t be right,” I whisper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It is,” he tells me. “You know that it\u0027s true. The ocean your mother used to tell you about was before the Return. Everything has changed since then. Everything.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But the ocean is too big for that,” I protest. “Too vast, too deep. I don\u0027t understand how the Return can touch that too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe waits for a moment before responding, “Nothing in this world is deep enough to withstand the Unconsecrated.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks me in the eyes, traces a finger along my jaw. “Not even us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI almost believe him but then I shake my head, anger welling deep. “You are wrong, Travis. You are wrong.” I ball my hands into fists and punch at his chest. “I don\u0027t know why you\u0027re telling me such stories but you are wrong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe takes my hands in his own, curling his fingers around my fists. “She told me that if I allowed you to go to the ocean I would never see you again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then she was wrong too!” I yell. I pull away from him, backing toward the door so that we\u0027re no longer touching. “If you are telling me the truth, then why didn\u0027t you tell me this before? Why did you give me such hope and then tear it away?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I thought I could protect you,” he answers. “Because I was hoping I would be enough.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No.” I shake my head tightly. “I thought you wanted to see the ocean as well. I thought it was our dream. I thought…” I swallow and take a deep breath. “I thought you were coming for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe doesn\u0027t look at me as he shakes his head. It feels as if the world is falling away from me. The realization of what he\u0027s saying—what he\u0027s not saying—tunnels deep inside me. The words echo in my head: he was never coming for me, he was never coming for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything spins; everything becomes unbearably bright and then dim. My world tilts and I step backward until my knees hit the edge of the bed and I\u0027m sitting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy body hurts so bad I want to throw up. “You were never going to come for me, were you?” I ask.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0027m sorry, Mary,” he says and it\u0027s the same thing as a no.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything is breaking inside me, shattering. “I don\u0027t understand, why are you telling me all this now? Why are you doing this to me?” I put my hands over my head, curling into a ball.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I…” He stops midsentence and is silent. A muscle ripples along his jaw. “Mary, I wanted you too much. And that day on the hill, it was everything. It showed me what life could be—what hope could be. I wanted to believe we could be together. I wanted to believe we could break our vows and that somehow everything would still be okay.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze is distant and he shakes his head. “I was going to come for you, Mary. Even though I knew I could never be the type of husband that Harry could be. Even though I was a broken man I was going to come for you. I was going to let my passion overwhelm my common sense. But then seeing Gabrielle changed everything. I saw what happened to those who strayed from the Sisters\u0027 path. I saw what would happen to us—to you. And I couldn\u0027t bear it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All I could see was you in that red vest, you tearing against the fences. I couldn\u0027t let that happen.” He drops his head to his chest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgony of what could have been chokes my words. “We could have made it,” I say. “We could have escaped.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he looks at me his eyes are wet with tears. “No, we couldn\u0027t have,” he says softly. “We never could have escaped.” He places a hand over his leg. “I\u0027m too broken. They would have found us—we never could have gotten away.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe kneels in front of me, takes my hands and holds them in his. “Don\u0027t you see, Mary? Ever since Gabrielle I\u0027ve done nothing but try to keep you safe because I was too afraid of losing you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI shake my head, my thoughts swimming and swirling, tossing about wildly. “Why didn\u0027t you tell me all this before? Why are you saying these things now?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because I have been protecting you for too long. Gabrielle said the ocean was dangerous and I thought I could keep you from it. But then when I saw you yesterday drowning under the Unconsecrated I realized that I can\u0027t do it anymore. I can\u0027t be the one to make these decisions for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I realized yesterday that it doesn\u0027t matter about the ocean. Because even if we never find it you still no longer need me. Once I thought I could protect you. Could take care of you. But you\u0027re strong enough. I\u0027ve never seen anything like what you did yesterday. I\u0027ve never seen someone survive the way that you have. To fight the Unconsecrated and live!” He shakes his head, his eyes bright and wide. “I was in awe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s as though he\u0027s pulled a plug in my body and all the pain and anger is slipping out, leaving nothingness behind. “I will always need you,” I whisper. “All this time I\u0027ve waited for you. And you were never coming for me. Why did you let me wait for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTravis sighs, flexes his fingers against the windowsill. “I think that even then I knew I wouldn\u0027t be enough for you, Mary. It\u0027s no longer about the ocean. It\u0027s about you and what you want and need. Maybe you\u0027ll be happy with me for a few years….”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe pauses and I can see tears flooding his eyes again. “I can\u0027t be your second-choice dream.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to scream at what he\u0027s saying, to push him down and make him take back the words. Instead, I step past him and walk to the window. I lean out, my hips digging into the sill. For a moment I wonder if I would be able to smell the salt of the ocean from here. If I could close my eyes and concentrate hard enough, if I could discern the crash of the waves on the shore. If I could taste the air, taste the ocean.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEver since that day on the hill, ever since he promised he would come for me, this was always supposed to be our dream, together. It was never supposed to be about having to choose one or the other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mary,” Travis says, walking up behind me. He puts a hand on my shoulder but I shrug it off. I don\u0027t want him to be right. I don\u0027t want to believe what he\u0027s saying, that I could be so cruel and selfish. His heat radiates against me, trying to fill the emptiness inside, but I wrap my arms tight around myself as a shield.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turn away from him then and walk to the door. As I cross the threshold he asks, “Would you ever give up the ocean for me?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitate, place a hand on the doorjamb. I had once hoped that, as it did for my mother, love would keep all other dreams at bay. The realization that it will not washes over me and I walk through the door, leaving him without an answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 30\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s difficult to find solitude in the platforms in the trees and so I walk along the rope bridges until I am as far away from Travis and the rest as possible. I sit and let my legs dangle, the scabs from the Unconsecrated itching as they heal. I want to cry but I can\u0027t find the tears. I want to yell but I don\u0027t want to cause a scene. And so I sit and stare at the Forest and think about Travis\u0027s admission that he was never going to come for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat he was going to let me marry Harry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull out the slim book with the photograph of New York City. In the full light of day the colors of the picture seem duller than they did in the attic, but I don\u0027t care as I trace my fingers over the buildings, wondering about them. Wondering about the number of people it would take to fill them all and wondering what happened to those people. Of all the stories that have been lost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI set the photo aside and focus on the book. I\u0027ve never seen one this small—the only books in our village were the Scriptures and the genealogy tomes. Carefully I flip back the red leather cover and trace the elegant letters on the first page, not understanding their meaning: Shakespeare\u0027s Sonnets. The paper is thick and yellow and I can feel the edges crumble under my fingers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot able to resist, I flip through the book, page after page of carefully arranged text. And at the top of each page, a letter. My hands freeze, the wind flapping the paper in front of me. I swallow and turn back to the beginning of the book. There, over the first block of text is the letter I. On the next page, over the next block of text are the letters II.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am shaking as I follow the pattern, everything suddenly making sense. The letters are numbers. I flash back to what Gabrielle wrote on her window and turn to the corresponding block of text, skimming it quickly. It talks of judgment and plagues and good and evil and truth and doom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI remember the letters on the trunk near our village and turn the pages until I find XVIII, number eighteen. One line jumps from the page, making me catch my breath: “Nor shall death brag thou wander\u0027st in his shade….” I drop the book, too many letters and numbers and words swirling through my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s so clear to me now that I can\u0027t understand how I didn\u0027t realize it earlier. The paths were marked with numbers. And there must be a pattern to them, an order we have yet to figure out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am so consumed by these thoughts that I don\u0027t register another person with me until he speaks. I tuck the photo in the book and push it under my skirt so that he doesn\u0027t see it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mary, are you going to die like the rest of them?” Jacob asks in his little-boy voice. “Are you going to turn and then come eat me?” He kicks his toe against the rough boards nailed to a thick branch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can\u0027t help but laugh as I say, “No, honey. I wasn\u0027t infected. What made you think that?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe frowns and I realize that I shouldn\u0027t have laughed. “It was Aunt Cass,” he answers. “Uncle Travis told her what happened before, when you were escaping. She said she wondered why you didn\u0027t just die when all those Unconsecrated were all over you in the house. She thinks you must be sick.” With his slight lisp Cass becomes Cath and Unconsecrated becomes Unconthecrated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“But Uncle Travis said you fought off the Unconsecrated and that you were real brave. Is that true, Aunt Mary? Did you really fight them?” He pauses for a moment and if possible his voice becomes even smaller. “Can you teach me how to fight them too? Because they scare me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tug at his hand, pulling him into my lap. His lip trembles and I wrap my arms around him and squeeze. “None of us wants to be like them,” I say. “And I promise you that we will do everything we can to keep you safe.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I don\u0027t mean to be afraid,” he says. “But sometimes I can\u0027t help it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I know, sweetheart. We\u0027re all afraid,” I tell him. And somehow holding him makes me less scared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You know,” I tell him after a moment, “Argos is the one who really saved me. He\u0027s the one who rescued me when I fell.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe giggles. “I like Argos.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then he\u0027s yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe looks up at me with his large eyes. “Really?” I can hear the hope in his voice and it fills me with joy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, really. You can have him—with him around you can be less scared.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe hugs me, his little fingers fierce around my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can feel the footsteps of someone approaching. “Jacob,” Cass says, “your uncle Jed is looking for you to help him prepare dinner. Do you want to go help him?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Aunt Cass, guess what?” he shouts, jumping from my lap. “Aunt Mary said I could have Argos to protect me from the Unconsecrated!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCass smiles and ruffles his hair. “I hope you thanked her,” she says and as his cheeks grow pink I say, “Of course he thanked me.” I wink at him and he skips back down the platform and across the bridges calling out for Argos as if there isn\u0027t a world of death below us all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Thank you,” she says when he\u0027s gone and I nod my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe comes to stand next to where I sit and leans against the railing as she scans the horizon. We haven\u0027t truly spoken since before the breach. Since she told me that I was to marry Harry. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-forest-of-hands-and-teeth-the-forest-of-hands-and-teeth-1/page-27.html","bookId":2585,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:11:38 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:11:38 PM"}
