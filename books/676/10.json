Any questions?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Everyone stared at her.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Good,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I want everybody to make socks. Okay, get started.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Dameon looked at his knitting needles. He didn\u0027t have a clue.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e He looked back at Mrs. Jewls. Now, more than ever, he was sure she was somehow different.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She was sitting at her desk, knitting and eating Baloneos. Dameon couldn\u0027t remember Mrs. Jewls ever eating a Baloneo before.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e A Baloneo was an Oreo cookie, except instead of the white part, there was a round hunk of baloney.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Miss Mush invented them.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hey, Mac,\" whispered Dameon. \"Does Mrs. Jewls seem different to you?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"She\u0027s fat,\" said Mac.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"That\u0027s not a nice thing to say,\" said Dameon.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I didn\u0027t say it to Mrs. Jewls,\" said Mac. \"I didn\u0027t go, \u0027Hey, Mrs. Jewls. You\u0027re fat!\u0027 \"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls cleared her throat as she stood up. She walked around the room. \"Very nice, D.J.,\" she said. \"You\u0027re doing fine, Rondi.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She stopped at Joe\u0027s desk.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Oh, Joe!\" she gushed. \"Look, everybody, I want you to see Joe\u0027s sock!\" She held it up. \"Isn\u0027t it the most beautiful sock you ever saw?\"\n\u003cbr\u003e 48\n\u003cbr\u003e It was a great sock. Everybody oohed and\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e aahed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Joe was as surprised as anyone. He didn\u0027t know he knew how to make socks. But the boy was born to knit.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls started to cry. \"I love this sock,\" she sobbed.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Uh-oh,\" said Kathy. \"I think she\u0027s finally\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e flipped out!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I love you, Kathy,\" said Mrs. Jewls. She looked around the room. \"I love all of you.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e She put her hand on Kathy\u0027s desk. \"I love this desk,\" she said. \"I love the blackboard. I love the clock on the wall.\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e There was a ruler on the floor.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Mrs. Jewls picked it up. \"I love this ruler,\" she declared.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"Hey, that\u0027s mine!\" said Dana. \"But, uh, that\u0027s okay, Mrs. Jewls.

He was going to miss her a lot! He wiped a tear from his eye. \"It\u0027s unfair!\" he shouted. \"We finally come back to Wayside School after being gone for so long. And now you\u0027re leaving us!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I have to,\" said Mrs. Jewls.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I know,\" whined Dameon. \"You have to make sure that you and your baby are healthy. But it still isn\u0027t fair!\"\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e \"I think you\u0027ll like your substitute teacher,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I spoke to him over the vacation.
