Auguste was already running toward me with a real cloak, but I wanted to keep the tailcoat for myself to see what hints it might hold about its owner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Please give the prince my regrets,” I said to Sylvie as I sashayed past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd split to allow my passage, the girls standing sentry between the goggle-eyed gentlemen and my barely dressed form. No one spoke, but Bea’s hand lingered on my arm as I passed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I was in the building and out of sight, I cracked my back and allowed myself to limp. Damn, that hurt. I went straight upstairs and locked my door. After tossing the oil-stained tailcoat on my bed, I went over every inch of it. There was nothing unusual, just a handkerchief soiled with engine grease and a half-smoked cigarillo. No name tag, no packet of calling cards and bills like so many gentlemen carried in their breast pockets. Whoever the bastard was, he’d planned the kidnapping far enough ahead that he’d remembered to empty his pockets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wadded up the coat and hid it in the petticoat drawer of my armoire, undressed, and fell into bed. My head swam, half woozy with blood and half hyped up on fading adrenaline. Someone knocked on my door, and hours later, someone else scratched quietly. I ignored them both. I’d had more than enough excitement for one night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next morning came all too soon and, with it, the ache of bruises in places that had never been bruised before. I stretched and pointed my toes, feeling limp all over. As if they’d been listening at the door, which they probably had, Mel and Bea slipped in and approached my bed as if I might bite their heads off or faint.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, la. I can’t believe it. I just can’t. Are you . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBea signed alive, and I laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Y’all, I’m fine. Giant metal elephants run away with me all the time, and I haven’t died yet.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s all over the papers. Shows are sold out for weeks. Everyone wishes to see you. Mon dieu, chérie. You’re the most famous girl in Mortmartre. Ever.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could not care less that everyone wanted to see me. But wait. Someone more than wanted to see me—someone was expecting me. I’d promised Lenoir a full day of sitting, and the thought of that dizzy, drunken, golden time under the relaxing and dreamy effects of the Red Fairy was a mighty powerful lure. I would heal faster and not feel as much pain, and I would have a bit of respite from the wagging tongues and clutching hands of the gentlemen who would be showing up later tonight to see the girl who’d lived through a pachyderm rampage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBea held out a tube of blood, and I took it and thanked her. They had a rushed conversation of signs, and I barely understood that there was something Bea wanted to tell me that Mel didn’t want me to know. And I did want to know, but I didn’t want them to know that I was learning more sign language. And I also didn’t want anything to come between me and Lenoir’s studio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI drank the blood faster than usual—not that I needed it after draining the pilot last night. When I went to my ewer and began to bathe hurriedly, Mel rushed over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Mais . . . surely you’re not going out today, are you? You need to rest.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled and continued trying to clean off the smudges of grease and blood. “I’m off today. And I have an appointment with Lenoir. I can’t be late.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two daimons exchanged a weighty glance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It can wait.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pulled clothes out of my armoire and darted behind my screen to change. “It really can’t.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Demi, ma chérie. We understand. We really do. But you are already a star. A portrait by Lenoir will not make life any different. You’re as high as you can go already. But you have to take care of yourself.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stopped furiously pulling the strings of my corset to glare at her over the screen. I’d had just about enough of this line from her and from Vale. And I couldn’t even tell the daimons about how my main goal with everything was simply a front to get to Cherie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I am taking care of myself. But what I need most is not a bunch of mother hens and sassy-pants roosters telling me what I need. I’m not going to Lenoir’s studio because I think it’s going to make me a star. I’m going because it’s relaxing there. Because he’s the only person who understands me, who gets what I’m going through. When he’s painting me . . . I don’t know. It’s peaceful. Relaxing. Nothing here is ever relaxing. Here, I feel like someone owns every aspect of me, every moment of my time.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And when he’s painting you, you don’t feel like that?” Mel asked carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI rolled my eyes. “It’s not like that. I just don’t have to be what everyone else wants me to be.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBea frantically sketched signs in the air, and Mel sighed. “She says . . . well, I don’t think you should tell her that. Oh, la. As you wish, my love. Long ago, the daimons believed that—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe door burst open with Charline in a long purple robe that grazed the ground and a fancy headdress. Behind her stood two human gendarmes and what had to be Paris’s version of a reporter, a dapper daimon with a gravity-defying mustache who held a very large and unwieldy camera-type thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI huddled behind the screen. “Mademoiselle Charline, I must protest. I’m undressed!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sharp flash blinded me and filled the room with pink smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Well, that’s her job, ain’t it?” the reporter said, and I pulled my lips back to show my fangs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the gendarmes looked as if he wanted to hide under the bed, but the other one, the older one from yesterday’s scene at the toppled elephant, growled and grabbed the reporter by his arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s no way to speak to a lady,” he barked at the reporter as he dragged him out of the room and slammed the door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, mon dieu. We’ll be on the front page of all the papers,” Charline wailed, an elegant arm over her eyes, probably to hide the dollar signs that had appeared there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m Monsieur Bonchance, and this is my associate, Monsieur Legrand. We’re sure you’re upset and in need of recovering, mademoiselle, but we do need to ask you just a few questions so that we can better understand what happened yesterday,” the mustachioed gendarme said, his voice gentle, as if I were a dog that might bite him. “Did you know the fellow in question?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m afraid not. I was expecting Prince Seti, but then the elephant just started walking. I climbed up into the engine room and asked him who he was and what he was doing, but all he said was ‘Mal.’ Do you know what that means?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll ask the questions here!” the younger gendarme barked, and I raised an eyebrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think what Monsieur Legrand means is that as the gentleman died in your presence and under curious circumstances . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The little doxy drained a human being, inches away from us! In broad daylight!” Legrand barked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It wasn’t daylight; it was after midnight,” Mel burst in as Bea wagged a finger in the surprised policeman’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Monsieur, I do believe that under the circumstances, it is considered self-defense, n’est-ce pas?” Charline lovingly dragged Mel and Bea out the door. “If she were a Pinky—I mean, a human—and she had used a hammer or a knife to dispatch her kidnapper, would that not be perfectly within the law?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLegrand sneered. “All due respect, madame, but a hammer ain’t teeth. Teeth’s personal.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at the clock and blanched. “Messieurs, might I make an appointment to speak with you personally, in private, that we might share information on this incident?” I batted my lashes and slunk around the screen, almost dressed, to take Legrand’s narrow, pale hand in mine. He blushed beet-red, perfuming the air with the scent of blood. When I licked my lips, I’m sure he thought it meant something other than polite hunger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBonchance answered for him. “That would be satisfactory, mademoiselle. We shall expect you tomorrow morning.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Merci mille fois, monsieur.” I bowed over his hand and gave him my most charming smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“And I do hope you fine gentlemen will accept these tickets to tonight’s show? Mademoiselle Demitasse is understandably too upset to perform, but the daimon girls will astound you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe younger, angrier gendarme accepted the gold-trimmed tickets and cleared his throat. “We’ll leave you to your business, then, mesdames. Good day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the gendarmes were out the door, Charline turned to me, her eyes as sharp as a crow’s on a busy highway. “You,” she started, and I held up a hand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m off. You promised.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed heavily. “Tomorrow,” she said slowly, “will not prove to be your favorite day.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI buttoned up my jacket and gave her my most charming smile. “Provided an enormous copper elephant doesn’t fall on me, I suspect I’ve experienced worse.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t understand half the things she muttered in Franchian as I sashayed out the door, and I didn’t care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was going to see Lenoir.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e23\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Lenoir met me at the door to his flat, my heart stuttered prettily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I heard you went for quite a ride last night, my Demitasse. I didn’t expect you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Water under the bridge, monsieur.” I fluttered my eyes behind my fan. “But today, I am yours.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRare and bright, his smile startled me. “And I couldn’t be more pleased.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed him upstairs, mentally comparing his body with Vale’s as the cats twined around my ankles. The two men were built differently, and Lenoir was much older, but I had no complaints. In a way, I felt a little sorry for the men of Sang. With so many petticoats and hoops and bustles, they had no way to judge a woman’s true shape until they got her undressed, which didn’t happen often. In Sangland, from what I understood, the Pinky women were so terrified to reveal their skin to the noses of bludrats that they rarely removed all their clothes, even for lovemaking. Sometimes I regretted being bludded, but when it came to personal freedoms and safety and how good it felt to take off thirty pounds of fabric and breathe at night, I was definitely on the right team. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wicked-after-midnight-blud-3/page-44.html","bookId":1599,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:51 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:45:51 PM"}
