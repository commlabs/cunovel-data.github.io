I don’t know if the few extra hours to wait are going to give me more time to study or more time to freak out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorry filled his gaze as he paused from getting prepared for class to look at me. “I have a free period at eleven if you need a last-minute cram session.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, dear God. I didn’t have a class then, either. But even as my brain told me to say I did, my mouth blurted, “I have a free period then too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe straightened as if surprised by that, but then he smiled. “Cool. You want to meet up at the library or some place? I could quiz you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo. No, I didn’t want to meet at the library, because actually, secretly, I really did want to meet up—anywhere—with him. But I knew I shouldn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy mouth worked faster than my brain, though. “Okay,” I said. “That would be great.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have no idea why I asked Zoey to meet me in the library. Alone. I was an idiot, that’s probably why. I was tempted to text Cora and see if she wanted to meet us there too, cut down on the alone-factor, but I didn’t. I don’t know why I didn’t do that either. Or maybe I did know why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCora was not a library type of girl, and if I asked her to join us, and she said no—which she would—then I’d have to explain why I really needed her there, and then she’d know my hormones were unfaithful little turds who’d been responding to another woman aside from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should’ve just not asked Zoey at all, but I had really liked helping her study the other week. It had been easy and relaxing and...I really liked her. It made me wonder if we could be friends after all. I knew a lot of girls who were pretty and I was never worried about my attraction to them. So why had I been so leery about my fascination with her? I could totally do this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYeah, I was that sure of myself...until I walked into the library and saw her sitting at a table with an opened textbook in front of her. A wall full of windows was letting the sun in, and the way the light hit her almost made her glow. As if sensing my presence, she looked up, and yeah, I knew exactly why I shouldn’t be her friend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was no mere attraction. What I suffered from was total, debilitating awareness. Every freaking inch of me tuned in to her. Her green eyes had my stomach churning. Her smile made my mouth go dry. The way her perfect fingers lifted to push a long piece of hair out of her face had my jeans suddenly tighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp until four months ago, I’d never even seen a woman naked. But now I had. I’d touched and licked and experienced things that blew my mind. My body couldn’t stop itself from wanting to touch and lick and experience those things again...with Zoey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy step faltered. I shouldn’t do this. I so should not spend any more time with her. But her smile wavered, and I saw the hint of hurt pierce her eyes. No way could I let her down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides, no matter how forceful a couple of my urges were, I would never ever betray Cora.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could handle this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey,” I said, setting my book bag on the table next to hers. “How much time do we have?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd great, my mind went straight to the gutter with that question. How much time could I strip her bare and thrust into her—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Zoey didn’t seem affected, thank goodness. She checked her wrist. “Forty minutes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded and sat across the table from her, tense but also a little charmed that she actually wore a watch. I don’t think I knew any girl anymore who wore one. My grandmother had always worn a thin silver watch. I still had the sentimental piece of jewelry stored in a little box in my closet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eZoey pulled some papers from her bag and started explaining what she needed to know. Her test was over cell biology, so I glanced over the study guide she’d scribbled on and started to quietly quiz her about proteins and ribosomes and amino acids. She did great for the most part but a couple acronyms like RNA, RER, and ER tripped her up, so we went over those again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHalf an hour later, I lowered the study guide and raised my eyebrows. “I think you have this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Really?” A hopeful grin lit up her face. I loved putting it there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a nod, I said. “You’ll get an A, no problem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Gosh, I hope so.” She tucked a piece of hair behind her ear before slipping her study sheet into her biology book. “I know how much you like it, but biology is one class I do not want to have to retake.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smiled, not offended. As she pulled her bag closer to cram the book inside, I noticed an opened three-ring binder sitting on the table that had been hiding under her biology book. “Oh. Here. Don’t forget this.” I reached out and snagged it for her only to notice her handwriting taking up every line. A couple words caught my attention. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/with-every-heartbeat-forbidden-men-4/page-54.html","bookId":2703,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:25 AM"}
