His bracelet gleamed dully in the half-light from the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that I thought about it, he hadn\u0027t had that bracelet on in the cage. Then again, something like that could fall right off your paw.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you get out?\" I demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConfusion nickered over his face. \"Out?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cast a glance at Luc, who was staring back and forth between us. I needed to get Adam away from the boy, especially since I might have to kill him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let\u0027s discuss this outside.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fine.\" He gave Luc a stern glare. \"Stay here.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam headed for the front of the house, and I followed, fingers surreptitiously unzipping the compartment that held the silver knife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, the night was completely dark. The moon was gone; the sun wasn\u0027t yet up. I pulled out the weapon, tightening my fingers around the hilt. \"I\u0027m taking Luc.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam faced me, saw the knife, and laughed, \"Didn\u0027t we do this already? I\u0027m not a werewolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was so different from the man I\u0027d left in the swamp. Sure he looked and sounded the same, but the snakelike coldness had left his gaze and the nasty smirk no longer twisted his mouth. When he spoke he didn\u0027t say evil, hurtful things. At least not yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I saw you change,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSomething flickered in his eyes. \"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t deny it, and even while I\u0027d seen the truth, believed it, too, somewhere inside I must have been hoping for a miracle. \"You don\u0027t remember?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Just tell me when and where.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About an hour ago. Where Charlie died. I left you in a cage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe cursed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How did you get out?\" I repeated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored my question, clenching and unclenching his fists in great agitation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Adam! I\u0027m not going to let you hurt Luc.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFury spread across his face, and quick as a forked tongue, his hand shot out and grabbed the knife by the blade, taking it away with an ease and quickness that was mind-boggling. He flipped the weapon end over end and it stuck in a fence that separated the trailer park from a used-car lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI fought the urge to run. \"I\u0027m not leaving without him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You aren\u0027t leaving with him, either. He\u0027s my son.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You lied to me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I he all the time, cher. Anymore I wonder if I even know what\u0027s a lie and what isn\u0027t.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said you weren\u0027t the loup-garou!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe sighed. \"I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I should believe an admitted pathological liar?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Believe what you want.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had a thought Maybe the loup-garou wasn\u0027t harmed by silver. Maybe all the tests I\u0027d run on Adam had been a waste of time. Hell, maybe he could slip through bars, or at the least bend them with his superhuman strength.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam started for the trailer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are you going?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027To tell Sadie I\u0027ll be back in an hour. I have to go into the swamp.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What? Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe ignored me, disappearing inside for a few moments before coming out again, then grabbing me by the arm. \"You\u0027re going with me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to pull away. \"I don\u0027t mink so.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe could easily strangle the life out of me and toss me into the swamp as alligator bait. I was starting to think he\u0027d done it before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis grip tightened. \"I leave you here and you disappear with Luc. I don\u0027t have time to search for you. I can\u0027t leave New Orleans until the new moon comes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was so surprised he\u0027d admitted that, I allowed him to shove me into the passenger seat of my car, where I promptly got a dart gun up the ass. I moved the paraphernalia out of the way as he skirted the front fender, then got behind the wheel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis gaze flicked over the gun. \"So that\u0027s how you did it\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0027t bother to answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe picked up the weapon, checked the ammo, found it empty, and tossed the thing into the backseat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why are we going into the swamp?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have something to do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t suppose I can convince you not to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Frank Tallient will wonder what happened to me. When he gets here - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027s coming?\" Adam\u0027s voice deepened, and the glare he shot my way was downright cold. This was the man I\u0027d left in the cage. \"What did you do?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI swallowed and forced myself to answer. \"I told Frank where he could find the loup-garou.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam cursed. \"When was that?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Less than an hour ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of his tension eased. \"We\u0027ll be there before him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll raise a stink if he can\u0027t find me. You can\u0027t leave Luc alone.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you talking about?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you kill me, you\u0027ll fry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe death penalty was alive and well in Louisiana, though I didn\u0027t know for certain if they actually fried people anymore, or how often.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You think I\u0027m going to kill you, cher?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve killed before.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve risked more than I\u0027ve ever risked in my life to protect you,\" Adam said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You will.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe remained silent for the rest of the drive to the mansion, as well as the hike into the swamp.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sun was up. The day was going to be another scorcher. Nevertheless, I couldn\u0027t stop shivering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdam was insane, if not a werewolf. He was going to kill me and probably everyone I\u0027d spoken to about him. Cassandra, Detective Sullivan, Frank. Had he killed Mrs. Favreau?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe\u0027d most likely killed Charlie, the mystery stranger, and Mrs. Beasly. Such carnage was beyond my comprehension.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what really made me ill was the idea of leaving Luc in Adam\u0027s care. What would happen to the child with a monster for a father?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped into the clearing first, stopping so abruptly, Adam nearly ran me over from behind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cage was still there; the lock was still locked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Adam was still inside.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-creature-crescent-moon-nightcreature-4/page-36.html","bookId":2091,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:32 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:32 PM"}
