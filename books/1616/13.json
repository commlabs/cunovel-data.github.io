She played golf with the men.\" Margaret put down her teacup to free her hands for broader gesturing. \"As did I.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNapier\u0027s usually stoic demeanor shattered as he let go a brief and explosive laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I most certainly did,\" Margaret huffed. \"That Sydserf and I were a duo. I made quite a pretty shot on, what do you call it, the fairway.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dear heart, women don\u0027t \"—\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Women most certainly do. Why, Mary Queen of Scots herself was quite the golfer.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh really?\" He chuckled. \"My Margaret playing golf.\" Napier shook his head. He looked at his wife, ever amazed that he\u0027d been so blessed with a woman who never ceased to surprise him. He wasn\u0027t a naturally joyful man, but his wife made him more of one each day. Napier\u0027s mind turned to coarser things, and he mused he\u0027d risk much to catch sight of that plush rump of hers bending over a tee. \"Well, that would be quite a sight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMargaret flushed. They\u0027d been together nearly twenty years now, and he knew she recognized the look in his eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter savoring her discomfort for a moment, Napier aske d, \"But who is this lass then?\" He\u0027d finished with his tea, and set to smoothing the corners of his moustache up and the length of his goatee down. He knew that such vanities only emphasized his thin, elongated features, but he knew too that his Margaret\u0027s preference was a well -tended and fashionable man. \"Who—and where—is her family?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She claims the surname Deacon. I think it\u0027s Irish.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And are we to welcome this rudderless lass into our home?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well,\" Margaret exclaimed, \"we shall be gracious as always.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNapier recognized that even Margaret herself hadn\u0027t known until that moment where she would stand regarding the strange and wayward woman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But of course we\u0027ll do whatever you say, my beauty.\" He smiled warmly, a rarity seen generally only by his wife. Beautiful she was too, he thought. Her glossy brown hair was not yet grayed, and she bore the Graham family regal height and carriage. She\u0027d grown in girth since their youth, but he loved her all the more for it. Margaret was lush refuge for his tired bones, though he\u0027d never dare breathe as much to her, knowing how prickly she\u0027d grown about her weight. \"You are my one and only mistress, and you know I live only to please you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Good.\" Margaret\u0027s eyes sharpened. \"Then you will refrain from this Aberdeen madne ss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah.\" Napier girded himself. He\u0027d known she wouldn\u0027t be happy about his departure, and had been fearing this exchange. \"Go I must, dear heart. To protect your brother, at the least.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My brother,\" she grumbled. \"And what of your very own wife? You don \u0027t even agree with all this Covenanting nonsense.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I do not, it\u0027s true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And yet you go all the same? When I\u0027ve explicitly asked you not to?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Your brother needs me, Margaret. Even in his youth, he was a lad of principle. But a man can be blinded by his good intentions. James doesn\u0027t suspect the knife at his back, wouldn\u0027t think to. And yet I fear that with his Covenant, these Lowland noblemen see their opportunity. His virtuous movement has become an adder\u0027s nest of callous and opportunistic ambition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will there be a fight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I hope not.\" Napier\u0027s usually unreadable face creased with concern. He hated to see his wife worry so. \"Fret not. Margaret.\" He took her hand. \"I travel not as a soldier, but as a guardian. If this Magda is to travel with us. we\u0027ll need to install her well outside Aberdeenshire limits.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, do care for yourself, Archie.\" Margaret sniffled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course, pet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d die without you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And I you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you\u0027d best vow to bring my scamp of a brother back to me alive.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed and took her hand to his lips for a kiss. \"Perhaps I am wrong. Perhaps James has the right of it. I hope so for his sake. Regardless, I will be an ally at his back.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"To watch for that knife?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. dear heart.\" Napier placed her hand back in her lap with a gentle squeeze. \"To mind that knife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lowland nobles gather even now, and the weight of our war purse grows heavy.\" Archibald Campbell rattled a small leather purse, disdain beading his small, close-set eyes and quivering his thin, bloodless lips. \"The gold your little German princeling paid you was surely no more yellow than ours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCampbell grew vexed. He\u0027d summoned this general -for-hire all the way from the warring on the Continent, thinking that Alexander Leslie\u0027s Scottish heritage might inflame him to the cause, but Leslie only played as shy as a maiden at her first dance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, gold is good, but I care no more for this prayer book than I did for Gustavus,\" Leslie replied, referring to the Swedish king and would-be German princeling who\u0027d last bought his military services. \"Should King Charles march on your Covenanters, he might well have more men at his back than I ever faced in Germany.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The religion of your country is under siege.\" Campbell pulled his face into a mocking pout, exaggerating the sag of his thin skin and his droopy, overlong nose, making his face seem a thing carved from wax left too long in the sun. \"Are you to tell me that Alexander Leslie, celebrated sword-for-hire, cares solely for his own hide?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And who else\u0027s?\" Leslie replied matter-of-factly. \"Campbell, I\u0027ve no care for your cause. Spare me talk of king and kirk. I fight for the highest bidder, so save your sanctimonious breath for those precious noblemen of yours. I don\u0027t see many of them raising broadswords for this Covenant.\" He kicked a stool close to sit across from Campbell at his ornate desk. \"But double your payment in gold, and you\u0027ve my sword and my word.\" He carefully twisted the ends of his long moustache, letting the statement hang in the air. \"You crooked little man,\" Campbell muttered, reaching in a drawer for additional purses. \"But—,\"he snatched the money back before Leslie could grab it—\"I\u0027d have your word that my coin also buys me the services of some seasoned men. If Aberdeen refuses to sign the Covenant and sides against us, I\u0027d not belabor this. I shall need you to fight them. With hired men at your back, the townsfolk should scatter like leaves in the wind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll thank you not to call my ability into question. I can gut the Aberdeen townsfolk, if you will it. My father was a captain, as was his father before him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, but your mother was a wench.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Och.\" Leslie snatched the pouches from Campbell\u0027s hand. \"You\u0027ll have your men,\" he spat. \"And pleased they\u0027ll be for a day\u0027s work in their native land for a change. But what of you, Campbell?\" he sneered. \"Whose back will you be guarding the day we take Aberdeen? As I understand it, you favor the taste of blood.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCampbell\u0027s face soured, and he stared blankly at the mercenary seated in front of him. \"I\u0027ll have my own… concerns … that day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shuffled through papers on his desk as if already dismissing the soldier. \"But you do remind me,\" he added offhandedly, \"there\u0027s a small matter of sharing your command. There will, in fact, be some of your detested nobles fighting that day, and they\u0027ll not follow a mere sword-for-hire.\" He eyed Leslie derisively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, I feared as much, though it might cost you more coin.\" Leslie strode to the door, his presence more commanding than his small, wiry frame might suggest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Especially if I\u0027m expected to keep your noblemen alive. I\u0027m a soldier, not a caretaker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Despite your contempt, they\u0027re men of reason and class, who will want to follow one of their own. James Graham will march with you. The Marquis of Montrose. I suppose he \u0027s a skilled enough fellow,\" Campbell added. \"He\u0027s learned in the arts of war, with the teachings of battle in his head, if not the taste of it in his mouth. You\u0027ll stand with him, Leslie.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You send me to battle with a man who knows no more of war than what he was spoon-fed by his betters?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ho!\" Campbell silenced the general\u0027s protestations with a raised hand. \"Protocol demands you\u0027ve a nobleman as second in command. And I tell you, the Graham will suffice.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I see.\" Leslie\u0027s face was dark. \"Is that all, Campbell?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One last thing. Pray, remind me, what was that word you learned on your continental campaign?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye,\" Leslie smiled broadly, \"\u0027tis a German word I\u0027ve come to hold in high regard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Plunder!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChapter 9\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was tired, her face was cold and stiff from squinting, her hands covered in an oily grime of horse and dirt, and she hadn\u0027t been that saddlesore since she\u0027d taken her first long trail ride at the age of nine. And it was only the end of their first day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMagda hunched low in her tent and wrenched herself into a cross-legged position. She felt the slick of sweat under her arms and scowled as a fresh cloud of her own body odor filled the enclosed space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A problem, hen?\" James scratched on the flap of canvas that gave her some semblance of privacy. \"You\u0027re muttering like an old woman in there.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am not muttering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So say you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard his chuckle and angrily pulled the flap aside. \"I smell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe inhaled deeply. \"Like a rose on the vine, you are.\" James laughed then, and Magda swatted at him with the scarf of plaid wool she\u0027d worn knotted tight at her chin all day. \"Come.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve got another thing coming if you think I\u0027ll follow you again. I\u0027ve followed you enough for one day.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come, come.\" He reached his hand into the tent. \"I\u0027ll not bite. \" He waggled his hand for her to take it. \"No need to be churlish. I\u0027ve prepared your bath, m\u0027lady.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A bath?\" Magda ignored his outstretched hand and crawled from the tent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aye, there\u0027s a wee burn not half a league hence.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/sword-of-the-highlands-highlands-2/page-13.html","bookId":1616,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:49 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:05:49 PM"}
