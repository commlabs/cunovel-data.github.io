{"id":14592,"no":50,"title":"Chapter 11.","content":"The moment he had quitted Venetia, Lord Cadurcis returned home. He could not endure the usual routine of gaiety after her society; and his coachman, often waiting until five o’clock in the morning at Monteagle House, could scarcely assure himself of his good fortune in this exception to his accustomed trial of patience. The vis-à-vis stopped, and Lord Cadurcis bounded out with a light step and a lighter heart. His table was covered with letters. The first one that caught his eye was a missive from Lady Monteagle. Cadurcis seized it like a wild animal darting on its prey, tore it in half without opening it, and, grasping the poker, crammed it with great energy into the fire. This exploit being achieved, Cadurcis began walking up and down the room; and indeed he paced it for nearly a couple of hours in a deep reverie, and evidently under a considerable degree of excitement, for his gestures were violent, and his voice often audible. At length, about an hour after midnight, he rang for his valet, tore off his cravat, and hurled it to one corner of the apartment, called for his robe de chambre, soda water, and more lights, seated himself, and began pouring forth, faster almost than his pen could trace the words, the poem that he had been meditating ever since he had quitted the roof where he had met Venetia. She had expressed a wish to read his poems; he had resolved instantly to compose one for her solitary perusal Thus he relieved his heart:\n\u003cbr\u003e i.\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Within a cloistered pile, whose Gothic towers\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Rose by the margin of a sedgy lake,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Embosomed in a valley of green bowers,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e And girt by many a grove and ferny brake\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Loved by the antlered deer, a tender youth\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Whom Time to childhood’s gentle sway of love\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Still spared; yet innocent as is the dove,\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Nor mounded yet by Care’s relentless tooth;\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e Stood musing, of that fair antique domain\n\u003cbr\u003e \n\u003cbr\u003e The orphan lord!
