It wasn’t even twenty-four hours since this thing started. It felt like a year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe news feeds broke into the story to announce that the president was going to address the nation at 3:00 a.m. Goat wondered if he would pass the buck onto the previous administration, or to spooks within the intelligence community who still clung to the glory days of the Cold War. Or, would the president take the hit, be the captain of the ship? Either way, a lot of things were going to change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoat sipped his coffee and wondered when Billy would call. The last message from him said that they were going to take the infected outside. Since then … nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeadlights flashed as a car pulled into the lot.

Almost without thinking, his fingers moved, tapping keys as the bare-chested man pulled open the door and stepped into the Starbucks. The few remaining customers turned to look at him. The barista glanced up from the caramel macchiato she was making. She saw the bare chest and the tattoos. She saw the caked blood and the wicked smile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man stood blocking the door.
