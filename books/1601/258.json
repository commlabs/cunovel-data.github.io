He had the pulse of the battle, its rhythm. The beat it played was forlorn. Demandred was clever. He had not gone for Mat’s bait at the ford, where he had positioned a smaller army. Demandred had sent Trollocs there, but held back his Sharans. Had Demandred abandoned the Heights to attack Elayne’s army, Mat would have swept his own armies across the top of the Heights from the west and the northeast to smash the Shadow from behind. Now Demandred was trying to get his troops behind Elayne’s forces, and Mat had stopped him for the time being. But how long could he hold?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Aes Sedai were not doing well. The Sharan channelers were winning that fight. Luck, Mat thought. We’ll need more than a little of you today. Don’t abandon me now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would be a fitting end for Matrim Cauthon. The Pattern did like to laugh at him. He suddenly saw its grand prank, offering him luck when it meant nothing, then seizing it all away when it really mattered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlood and bloody ashes, he thought, putting away the empty waterskin, seeing only by a torch that Karede carried. Mat could not feel his luck at the moment. That happened sometimes. He did not know if it was with him or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, if they could not have a lucky Matrim Cauthon, they would at least have a stubborn Matrim Cauthon. He did not intend to die this day. There was still dancing to be done; there were still songs to be sung and women to be kissed. One woman, at least.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood and rejoined the Deathwatch Guards, the Ogier, Tam’s army, the Band, the Borderlanders—everyone he had put up here. The battle had resumed, and they fought hard, even pushing the Sharans back a couple of hundred paces. But Demandred had seen what he was doing, and had started sending Trollocs at the river up the slope to join the fray. It was the steep one—hardest to climb—but Demandred would know he had to pressure Mat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose Trollocs were a real danger. There were enough of them at the river to potentially surround Elayne and fight their way up to the Heights. If any one of Mat’s armies broke, he was done for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, Mat h?d thrown his dice and sent out his orders. There was nothing more to do Dut fight, bleed and hope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA spray of light, like liquid fire, flared from the western side of the Heights. Burning drops of molten stone fell through the dark air. At first, Mat thought that Demandred had decided to attack from that direction, but the Forsaken was still intent on destroying the Andorans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother flash of light. That was where the Aes Sedai fought. Through the darkness and smoke, Mat was certain he saw Sharans fleeing across the Heights from west to east. Mat found himself smiling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look\", he said, slapping Karede on the shoulder and drawing the man’s attention.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don’t know\", Mat said. \"But it’s setting Sharans on fire, so I’m mostly certain that I like it. Keep fighting!\" He led Karede and the others in another charge against Sharan soldiers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlver walked hunched under the bundle of arrows tied to his back. They had to have real weight; he’d insisted. What would happen if one of the Shadow’s people inspected the goods, and found that his pack had light cloth stuffed in the middle?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSetalle and Faile didn\u0027t need to keep looking at him as if he’d break any moment. The bundle wasn’t that heavy. Of course, that wouldn’t stop him from squeezing some sympathy from Setalle once they were back. He needed to practice doing things like that, or he’d end up as hopeless as Mat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir line continued forward toward the supply dump here in the Blasted Lands, and as it did, he admitted to himself that he wouldn’t have minded a pack that was a little lighter. Not because he was growing tired. How was he going to fight if he needed to? He’d have to drop the pack quickly, and this didn’t seem the type of pack that let one do anything quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGray dust coated his feet. No shoes, and his clothing now wouldn’t make good rags. Earlier, Faile and the Band had attacked one of the pitiful caravans trailing toward the Shadow’s supply depot. It hadn’t been much of a fight—only three Darkfriends and one oily merchant guarding a string of worn-out, half-fed captives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany of their supplies bore the mark of Kandor, a red horse. In fact, many of those captives had been Kandori. Faile had offered them freedom, sending them southward, but only half had gone. The rest had insisted on joining her and marching for the Last Battle, though Olver had seen beggars on the streets with more meat on them than those fellows. Still, they helped Faile’s line look authentic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat was important. Olver glanced up as they approached the supply dump, the path lined with torches in the cold night. Several of those red-veiled Aiel stood to the side, watching the line pass. Olver looked down again, lest they see his hatred. He’d known that Aiel couldn’t be trusted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA couple of guards—not Aiel, but more of those Darkfriends—called out for the line to stop. Aravine walked forward, wearing the clothing of the merchant they’d killed. Faile was obviously Saldaean, and it had been decided that she might be too distinctive to play the part of the merchant Darkfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are your guards?\" the soldier asked. \"This is Lifa’s run, isn’t it? What happened?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Those fools!\" Aravine said, then spat to the side. Olver hid a smile. Her entire countenance changed. She knew how to play a part. \"They’re dead where I left them! I told them not to wander at night. I don’t know what took the three, but we found them at the edge of camp, bloated, their skin black\". She looked sick. \"I think something laid eggs in their hollowed-out stomachs. We didn’t want to find what hatched\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe soldier grunted. \"You are?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Pansai\", Aravine said. \"Lifa’s business partner\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since when has Lifa had a business partner?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Since I stabbed her and took over her run\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat information they had on Lifa had come from the rescued captives. It was thin. Olver felt himself sweating. The guard gave Aravine a long look, then began walking down the line of people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFaile’s soldiers were mixed among the Kandori captives. They tried their best to hold the right posture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You, woman\", the guard said, pointing at Faile. \"A Saldaean, eh?\" He laughed. \"I thought a Saldaean woman would kill a man before letting him take her captive\". He shoved Faile on the shoulder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOlver held his breath. Oh, blood and bloody ashes! Lady Faile wasn’t going to be able to take that. The guard was looking to see if the captives were really beaten down or not! Faile’s posture, her manner, would give her away. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-memory-of-light-the-wheel-of-time-14/page-258.html","bookId":1601,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:54:25 PM"}
