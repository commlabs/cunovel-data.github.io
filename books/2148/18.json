{"id":96357,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"\u003cp\u003eOut of breath, I arrived at Penny for Your Thoughts to find the shop dark and a hanging sign with the word CLOSED.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wondered if Dr. Meadows was sequestered in her back room giving another cliched reading like she had given to my friends. Or was she giving one like mine\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;dead-on?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhatever she was telling her client, it couldn\u0027t be more important than what I had to tell her. I knocked until my hand hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man the size of several normal fathers combined, with a shaved head and more tattoos than skin, lumbered out from the store next to Penny for Your Thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s closed today. Can\u0027t you read the sign?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh... yes. It was just that sometimes she puts the sign out when she\u0027s doing a reading.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This is her day to stay at home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe man could have easy squashed me like a bug. Normally, I would have gotten back in my car and given way to the large, tattooed obstacle obstructing my goal. But Brandon\u0027s life was on the line and I had to drum up all my courage to get to Dr. Meadows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you know where she lives?\" I asked in my nicest voice. \"This is very important.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0027m not sure what that tattooed man deemed important\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;or if he was going to demand details. I wasn\u0027t about to admit to him that my new love was a werewolf.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe obviously didn\u0027t think I was the type to be hanging around a tattoo parlor and didn\u0027t seem to want to be further bothered by my presence. I waited outside his shop as he popped inside\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;afraid the tattoo artist was going to ink Dr. Meadows\u0027s address on my back. Instead, he returned quietly and was kind enough to write it down on a piece of paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI followed his directions closely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI arrived at a two-story cottage home that appeared delightfully magical. Wood-carved sculptures lined the yard. Orbs of every color dotted what must have been a summertime garden. Ceramic and mosaic tiles spelled out New Age affirmations. Artistic symbols of every religion hung from the porch. I was met with the tune of a thousand wind chimes clanging in the breeze. I knocked on her door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Meadows answered. Her long gray hair was frizzy, and she covered her flowing blouse with a South American shawl.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry to bother you, Dr. Meadows. But do you remember me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI could see she was trying to place me. I was all bundled up from the cold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you the one selling candles for your school band?\" she asked. \"I\u0027ve been waiting for them to be delivered.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lowered my hoodie. \"No. I came to your store for a reading with my friends.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh yes, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Please, I must talk to you. I need your help.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I wasn\u0027t expecting company, but please, come in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Meadows\u0027s house was not unlike her store. It felt warm and cozy, and the scent of vanilla greeted all visitors. Dreamcatchers hung against the walls, and amethysts and crystals lined every vacant space. Expensive-looking African and Native American artwork decorated her home as if it were a museum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You were right,\" I said forcefully.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"About everything!\" I was nearly shouting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Calm down, let me brew you some tea.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t have time for tea. Do you remember what you said to me?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh... I do so many readings....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You had insight for my friends\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;about their personalities. But when it came to me, you said, \u0027Beware of the woods... of the sounds of howling. There could be outsiders who will turn... underneath the glow of the full moon.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ah, yes. I do remember.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you say what you did to me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was just a feeling.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I left your store, I decided to walk home. There was a blizzard. I got caught in it. And then, I was surrounded by a pack of wolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You must be joking.\" She was as skeptical of me as I\u0027d originally been of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How on earth did you survive?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The outsider. He saved me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Dr. Meadows seemed shocked by the accuracy of her prediction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why did you say what you did to me?\" I pressed again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I just had a feeling, that\u0027s all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it came true.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Predictions are often left to the individual\u0027s interpretation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You have to believe me. It happened just as you said\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;just as you warned me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Meadows was speechless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it\u0027s true,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure? One message could be interpreted many ways.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not in this case. Snow is snow. Howling is howling.\" I tried to persuade her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It couldn\u0027t be,\" she argued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But it could. It did. You knew.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was then we both realized the impact of our situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe rose, her face glowing like a crystal in the sunlight. \"All these years...\" she muttered to herself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn\u0027t believe it. I was having to convince Dr. Meadows that she was psychic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No one has believed you?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you have free will,\" she said in a daze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I do. But you predicted it. And I should have listened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat down as if her energy had been spirited away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s true, Dr. Meadows. Everything you told me came true. And now you have to help me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Help you?\" she asked, confused. \"But you made it safely out of the woods.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well... It\u0027s not me who needs help, really. But before I tell you... is there some sort of psychic-client privilege\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;like an attorney-client one?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think so...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I mean this must be a secret.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe you should tell a priest. Or a rabbi. Or a school counselor.\" She was shying away from taking any further responsibility in the matter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I have to tell you. No one else will understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDr. Meadows was hesitant. \"All right. Go ahead.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You said beware of a kiss underneath a full moon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I kissed a guy. And he changed...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Into a...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An animal?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, sort of.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honey, they all do.\" She laughed. \"That\u0027s all you wanted to tell me?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Meadows, you have to believe me. There is a guy in this town, and when there is a full moon, he turns...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Turns into what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A werewolf.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A werewolf?\" Dr. Meadows was incredulous. This time she let out a laugh that shook the candles flickering on her coffee table. \"Honey, now I think this may be something for the school nurse....\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dr. Meadows\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;you have all those books in your store about witches and warlocks. I thought you believed it all.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I do believe in some\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;I\u0027ve based my life\u0027s work on the supernatural. I\u0027ve seen and felt apparitions and other paranormal events. But I\u0027m sure that I\u0027m not the first person in the world who doesn\u0027t believe in werewolves.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you must. You are the only person I know who can help him,\" I urged. \"Dr. Meadows - \" I pleaded. But the psychic remained silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I only know what I told you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know things that others don\u0027t. You need to help my friend. Before it\u0027s too late. The moon will be full again soon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Dr. Meadows grew concerned. \"This isn\u0027t something I can change with a moment\u0027s notice. I have to consult books and spells. And...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI saw dollar signs in her eyes. \"I just have a small allowance. But I\u0027ll give you all of it - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe studied me, as if now realizing that I might be telling her the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This must remain a secret,\" I said. \"You are the only person I\u0027ve told. Not even my best friends or my parents know what happened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will need to observe him. Both when the moon is waxing and of course when it is full.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think that is possible now. He\u0027s forbidden me to see him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He is angry?\" she asked. \"He blames you? Us?\" She was suddenly afraid. \"You haven\u0027t told him where I live, have you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course not. And besides, he\u0027s not mad or vengeful. That\u0027s the point. This guy is different from anyone I\u0027ve ever met before. He refuses to be near me at night because he\u0027s afraid he\u0027s dangerous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, if what you say is true and he is a werewolf, you must stay away from him. For your own safety.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So, you believe me?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I do,\" she said. \"But I must see him. As soon as possible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave Dr. Meadows a huge hug. Her warm personality crept through her embrace. Finally, part of my guilt was assuaged. \"Thank you. I feel better already.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs she opened the door for me, the wind outside was still. Dr. Meadows grasped my shoulder as if something overcame her. \"You must never kiss a werewolf,\" she warned vehemently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shut the door behind me, and the chimes rang out wildly. Suddenly I didn\u0027t feel so at ease anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn\u0027t sure how I\u0027d convince Brandon to let Dr. Meadows meet him with the full moon approaching. He wasn\u0027t keen on me being with him under these circumstances, and she wasn\u0027t the kind of doctor who was certified by the medical board. How was I going to let a perfect stranger hang out in the woods and watch him transform into a lycan? There was so much Brandon was dealing with at once\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;but perhaps he\u0027d be comforted by someone trying to help him. I decided to text him with my news. As I waited for his response, I continued research on my essay. However, I didn\u0027t find any information on the effects of kissing a werewolf. I was so attracted to Brandon\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;by day and by night\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;all I could do was imagine kissing him. If I was warned not to, I wasn\u0027t sure what the implications might be. Maybe I\u0027d turn into a werewolf, or maybe it would be his demise. It wasn\u0027t fair that I wasn\u0027t supposed to kiss the one guy I was desperate to be with. Instead, I clung to his shirt as if it were him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd not knowing why\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;or what might happen\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;if I kissed a werewolf only made the torment worse. And if I was in agony, I could only imagine the torment Brandon faced alone at school or by night in the woods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was alone, too. I\u0027d always had Ivy to lean on and help me through situations. This time I\u0027d have to figure out the answers on my own. My life had been easier and much less complicated before Brandon Maddox arrived at Legend\u0027s Run, but I wouldn\u0027t trade knowing him for the peace I had then. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/once-in-a-full-moon-full-moon-1/page-18.html","bookId":2148,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:03 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:21:03 PM"}
