He would have offered to help but Cole knew from old. Brandon didn\u0027t let anyone near his bike. That the showroom-quality cruiser ever made it out onto the street was a miracle. Guess everyone had their passions. Their weaknesses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole\u0027s thoughts veered to Taryn Quinn and her exuberant expression the day he\u0027d given the go-ahead for her location survey. He\u0027d be a liar not to admit he was looking forward to spending time alone with her. And who knew? What she had organized might surprise him. If he\u0027d planned to be away from the station longer, he\u0027d have asked Roman Lyons to take the reins. But he\u0027d only be gone from work Friday. Three days in all. And two nights. Brandon\u0027s conversation brought him back. He wanted out from Cole\u0027s request that he investigate Eloise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"From what you tell me,\" Brandon said, polishing a handlebar as if it were a shapely female limb, \"the guy responsible for the attempts on your father\u0027s life has gone to his maker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So it would seem.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A death certificate\u0027s pretty final.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What if this guy was a patsy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s possible. Has your father\u0027s man mentioned anything about inconsistencies with regard to Eloise\u0027s loyalties?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not as yet.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like I said.\" In a white tee and faded jeans, Brandon straightened his linebacker shoulders and snapped the polishing rag at the air. \"You want her tailed? Big mistake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s my call.\" Cole wanted Eloise cleared of all suspicion, if only for his own peace of mind. \"Tell me what you know so far.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince their phone call five days ago, Brandon had dug around Eloise Hunter nee Warren\u0027s background. Born in Atlanta. Current age, thirty-five. Father a political figure. Mother a close friend of Cole\u0027s mom. Busted for soft drugs in high school. No conviction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePolishing the other handlebar now, Brandon confirmed that Guthrie had met Eloise when she was much younger. They caught up again when he flew out to visit his late wife\u0027s remaining relatives some months after her death. The subsequent contact between the two gave \"consoling the bereaved\" a whole new nauseating meaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole pushed off the pylon. \"Stick with it. And can you look into my father\u0027s new housekeeper while you\u0027re at it? Nancy Someone-or-other. She\u0027s far too creepy to be actually guilty of anything. Still...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon chuckled. \"Not your type?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemembering the mustache, Cole shuddered. \"Not by any stretch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon ran a palm over the gleaming crimson fuel tank. \"So what is happening with your love life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What love life?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s what I figured.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Remember that sweet thing you dated in our Navy Cadet days? Don\u0027t think you\u0027ve had a steady relationship since.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A year-long crush on a lieutenant\u0027s daughter isn\u0027t a steady relationship.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Dear, sweet Meredith McReedy. She broke your heart.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Like an egg in a skillet,\" Cole confirmed with a grin, \"and she didn\u0027t even know it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Selfish female, moving interstate and leaving you behind to pine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got over it. Eventually.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wonder if she\u0027ll be at the reunion tonight.\" Brandon glanced up from tossing the cloth in his special blue bike-cleaning bucket. \"You\u0027re going, right?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I received the invitation.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t avoid my question.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeading down the drive toward his car, Cole lowered the sunglasses perched on his crown onto his nose. \"I\u0027m beyond all that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beyond catching up with friends?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Everyone\u0027s married now. I can do without the questions. When are you settling down? Why haven\u0027t you got kids yet? Last reunion, the woman I took along got it into her head I should fall down on one knee and propose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon\u0027s big hands found his jeans\u0027 waistband. \"I\u0027m sure you can come up with a few more excuses if you really try.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re taking someone?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon was never without a lady on his arm - a little like Dex, only his brother\u0027s affairs were usually plastered across the pages of numerous gossip magazines. Brandon was far more discreet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ve asked an interesting lady I met a few weeks ago.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Weeks, did you say?\" Cole\u0027s lips twitched as he opened the driver\u0027s side door. \"Must be serious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t panic. No starry eyes on either side. We have more of a love/hate thing going on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Must be going around.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeaning a forearm along the window edge, Cole spilled all about the delectable, infuriating Taryn Quinn - how he was attracted to her on a number of levels despite the fact that he\u0027d soon need to terminate her contract.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole ended, \"Then I\u0027ll be the one needing a bodyguard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon\u0027s eyebrows hitched. \"Fiery, huh?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"On occasion.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sounds interesting. Bring her along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She barely tolerates me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, and she has brains.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole grinned. \"As a matter of fact, she does.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s her story? Why isn\u0027t she attached?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s a question I\u0027ve asked myself.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBrandon\u0027s hands dropped to his sides. \"You sound suspicious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. Not anymore. Just curious.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe friends said goodbye. A moment later, hand on the ignition, Cole stopped to wonder. Should he invite Taryn to that reunion? Business issues aside, he did find her intriguing. Certainly she\u0027d doused him in wine and had tried to put him in his place more than once. He\u0027d responded by giving in to her - defending her - in ways that, frankly, astounded him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorried him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrunting, he kicked over the engine and shifted the gears into Reverse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t need more trouble. No way would he invite her to that reunion tonight. If the idea ever crossed his mind again, he\u0027d make an appointment to have his head examined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaryn peered down at her cell\u0027s caller ID and froze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe\u0027d survived a whole five days at Hunter Broadcasting. Why was Cole calling her on a Saturday? Unless it was to tell her that the location survey scheduled for next weekend was off...that he\u0027d only been teasing and of course he had no plans to consider her show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe simply wouldn\u0027t pick up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is that your phone ringing, sweetheart?\" a voice called out from the kitchen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSitting on her modest home\u0027s back landing step, Taryn answered her aunt, who had dropped in as she did from time to time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t worry, Vi. I\u0027ve got it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe glared at the buzzing cell for a drawn-out moment and Vi\u0027s voice came again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is something wrong?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t know. Didn\u0027t want to know. Then again, she\u0027d go crazy waiting until Monday if she didn\u0027t find out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaryn braced herself. Stabbed the green key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole Hunter\u0027s deep voice echoed down the line. \"Sorry to disturb you out of work hours.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaryn quivered at the same time she shrank into herself. She wanted to say, \"Get it over with.\" Instead she said, \"That\u0027s okay. I\u0027m not doing anything special.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s Saturday.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe frowned. Waited. \"Uh-huh.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few seconds passed, long enough for Taryn to study the phone to make sure they were still connected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thing is,\" Cole finally said, \"I wondered if you were doing anything a bit later.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlanting her head, Taryn cast a glance around the garden. I\u0027ll probably still be sitting here trying to coax a frightened pregnant cat in for shelter before she gives birth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said. \"Not especially. Did you want to go over my notes for the survey? I have a ton, although I want to keep the location a secret from you until the end.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wanted Cole to absorb the undiluted impact when they arrived, which would hopefully inspire as well as challenge him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he said, \"It\u0027s not about the survey,\" a sick withering feeling dropped through her center. Her mouth went slack. This was it. The \"don\u0027t come back Monday\" call. The end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might remember that I mentioned many years ago I was a Navy Cadet. There\u0027s a reunion on tonight. I wondered if you might consider coming along.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe listened harder. There had to be more because this didn\u0027t make sense. A reunion? Had she missed something?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Taryn? You there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not certain I understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m inviting you out. Tonight. With me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe meant on a date? Now she was really confused.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re busy,\" he said, \"of course I understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not busy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you\u0027ll come?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat voice from the kitchen again. \"Any luck out there? Or is she still hiding?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer aunt was talking about the pregnant stray. No joy there. But maybe her luck was changing on another front. Taryn knew Cole was attracted to her, but she couldn\u0027t get her head around the idea of this suggestion to mix business with pleasure. Still, if he was in need of a date tonight, could she really refuse? She\u0027d been taken aback when Cole had stopped her earlier this week and, in front of witnesses no less, had told her to go ahead and arrange the survey. And that he\u0027d be going, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf he was willing to give an inch or two, shouldn\u0027t she reciprocate? She\u0027d already vowed to be accommodating, no matter what. The upside was that she could always use the time tonight to bend his ear more about her show.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she thought about it that way, she\u0027d be mad to decline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What time and where?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe heard his intake of air. Relief or disbelief?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s black tie. I\u0027ll collect you at - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, I\u0027ll meet you.\" She\u0027d find her own way there as well as back. She might want to take advantage of this opportunity, but she didn\u0027t need to dwell all night on how they would say good-night. A shake of hands in the car? A brush of lips against her cheek at the door?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAwkward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCole gave an address and a time. Taryn had ended the call and slumped back against the landing when her aunt appeared with a fresh bowl of cat biscuits. Vi studied her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You look like someone just handed you a million dollars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Even better. That was my boss.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Guthrie Hunter. You told me about him. Nice man.\" Vi set the biscuits down. \"Smart man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No. His son. Cole.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Calling you on a weekend? Has something come up at the studio?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaryn had worked long enough in television for her aunt to know the lingo, the oftentimes crazy hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It wasn\u0027t about work. Or not directly. He kind of, well, asked me out. A black-tie event tonight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And you said yes?\" When Taryn nodded, Vi grinned from ear to ear. \"You haven\u0027t gone out and enjoyed yourself in such a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s not like that. I don\u0027t actually like him. Cole Hunter is arrogant. Ruthless...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut her aunt was busy checking the ornate silver wristwatch she\u0027d owned for decades. \"If you want to get your hair done, it\u0027s already after eleven. Do you have something to wear?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A gown I bought for last year\u0027s awards ceremonies.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFull length. Sequined. Very Hollywood. Taryn cringed. Hopefully it wouldn\u0027t be over-the-top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe caught her aunt smiling again and pursed her lips.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t get all excited. Tonight isn\u0027t like that, okay? Even if I did want to settle down in a relationship - \" and she didn\u0027t \" - Cole\u0027s not that type.\" Not my type.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spend five minutes with the guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had little time for anything other than work and bossing people around. She was amazed he had any personal life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA noise filtered over from the garden...bushes rustling then a flash of yellow fur. That cat poked its whiskers out between some leaves but, in a heartbeat, vanished again. Taryn thumped a floorboard. She\u0027d been trying to lure that poor cat out for weeks. She looked so mangy Taryn knew she must be without a home. And yet she resisted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe she\u0027s happier that way,\" Taryn murmured, thinking aloud. \"Maybe she\u0027s happier on her own.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVi patted her niece\u0027s shoulder. \"Don\u0027t give up. Everyone wants companionship. Someone to care for them. Even the most unlikely types.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/losing-control-the-hunter-pact-1/page-7.html","bookId":1866,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:43:30 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:43:30 PM"}
