After glancing at Tegan, who shrugged—apparently she didn’t either—I answered, “We’re messengers, carrying word from Salvation.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why didn’t they send Longshot?” the man asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI relaxed a fraction. If I wasn’t mistaken, his tone contained a certain fondness, born of camaraderie and nights spent swapping stories. “I’m sorry. Longshot died in the last battle.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I think you’d better come in.” Something clanged, and a moving shadow showed me the security measure that would’ve crushed us had we taken another step down the ramp. “It’s clear for you to cross. Hurry now.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot wanting to inconvenience our host, I ran, and the others followed me. Behind us, the heavy weight went back up in cadence with grunting men who hauled it into place. Six of them stepped into the light afterward, led by the man I knew instinctively had invited us into Soldier’s Pond. They all wore dusty green clothing, patched more than once, and they held themselves like warriors with shoulders back, spines straight, and their chins inviting trouble. All of them were pretty close to Edmund’s age with silver growing among the bristles on their jaws. They all wore weapons on their hips, similar to the rifle, only smaller, and long-handled knives on their thighs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You said you have word from Salvation and Longshot couldn’t carry it. There’s been trouble?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“An incredible amount,” I said honestly. “I mean no disrespect … but are you the elder?” That was what they’d called the leader in Salvation, and what we called Whitewall down below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s an old word for it … and, no, as it happens, I’m not. I won’t make you tell the story twice. Davies, you’re head watchman while I’m gone. I’ll take our guests to see the colonel.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the men nodded as our escort led us through the warren. This was old-world construction, patched and shored to retain functionality. We didn’t have the means to build like this anymore, however. The size and shape of the structures was uncannily similar, one house after another stamped out with complete precision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s eerie,” Fade said beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“More like a child’s model than a real town,” I agreed softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This way. I’m Morgan. If we have to wake the colonel, I can’t guarantee how well your news will be received.” His tone held an odd, amused note that I couldn’t interpret.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t expect it would be glad tidings, so that hardly mattered, but the leader’s reaction could determine whether we succeeded. Morgan led us to a large building with a long front porch; there were lights affixed all over the top of it, which made me think it was some kind of headquarters. Inside, it bore out that initial impression with tables and chairs littered with papers, some of which had yellowed with age, others appearing to be recently manufactured. I could tell the new sheets came from Salvation, as they carried its imprint in the form of a tree thrice encircled. So among other things, Soldier’s Pond relied on Salvation for stationery, which was a fancy word for paper, according to Momma Oaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCandles burned, the wax crackling down into saucers, and there were a few lamps unfamiliar to me. They gave off an unpleasant smell as they burned, the flame flickering inside the glass like a trapped firefly. There were chairs too, where a few tired, worried-looking men were sprawled. I wondered which one was the colonel—and what a colonel was. It must be a title, similar to Elder Bigwater, since he wasn’t actually the oldest man in Salvation, unlike down below. Maybe he played a role like the Wordkeeper’s, consulting on important matters. But none of my speculations proved to be right when the colonel turned around; I could tell this was the person we sought by the way Morgan approached, and I smiled, both pleased and chagrined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI let Salvation change the way I see the world. This never occurred to me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt should have. Both Copper and Silk had played powerful roles down below. This woman was younger than Momma Oaks, but not quite as young as Ruth, Rex’s wife. I didn’t know how old that made her, but compared with the men around her, she seemed young. She wore her dark hair up in a complicated twist, and her clothes were crisp, despite the late hour. Likewise, her eyes were dark, ringed in faint shadows that said she hadn’t slept much recently. Sharp features lent her an aspect of intelligence; we’d find out whether that was true once we spoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Report, Morgan.” Her tone was brisk but not impolite. In my time in Salvation I’d come to note the difference. Yet her eyes held warmth that belied her words. “What’s the latest word in the territories?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI figured she must mean all the lands described on Longshot’s maps. Somehow I resisted the temptation to see if that word appeared anywhere on his papers. Instead I fixed my attention politely on Morgan, who was saying, “They come from Salvation, bearing news. I thought it best to bring them to you at once, Colonel Park.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I imagine it’s nothing good, but speak,” the colonel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing for it but to lay out the problem. “Salvation is under siege … and Longshot died in the first onslaught. I’m sorry to carry such bad tidings if you were fond of him, as I was.” I pushed past the lump in my throat, the fresh awareness that I’d never again hear his rasp of a voice or see his eyes crinkle as he smiled. “The town’s surrounded and the Freaks—Muties, I mean—are armed with fire. We don’t have the manpower to fight. So Elder Bigwater sent us to request reinforcements, and you’re the nearest settlement.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven my experience with people in positions of authority, I expected Colonel Park to say I was crazy and that I should eat some soup, then go to bed. Once again, I was wrong. Nothing in my experience prepared me for her reaction. She slammed a hand down on the nearest table, knocking over some pencils in a cup, scattering papers on the floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I told you,” she snapped at the men looking on with dawning horror.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReinforcements\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You knew about Salvation?” Stalker asked, seeming incredulous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe colonel shook her head. “I noticed a difference in Mutie attack patterns around here. Then they all moved off. I said it meant they must be planning something, but my advisors thought I was being an alarmist.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo not only did she believe us, she’d foreseen the progression. This would save us a lot of time begging and trying to convince somebody who didn’t believe the world could change. Some of the tension left me, though none of the exhaustion. I was conscious that every moment I spent talking was one that Salvation lost, and I remembered the men on the walls, gray-faced with fatigue and firing gamely on, even as Smith fought to keep up with their ammo usage. Without Stalker’s help, that might prove beyond his powers. We had to get back right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then you can probably imagine how things are,” I said. “How soon can you send some men with us?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man with a mustache spoke for the first time. “We can’t just send our standing forces off on a whim.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not a whim,” Tegan snapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother advisor agreed: “Saving Salvation might mean losing Soldier’s Pond.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This could be what the Muties want. How do we know their gambit in Salvation isn’t a diversion? The minute we weaken our entrenched position, they’ll attack,” the last councilor predicted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“They’ll come for you eventually,” Fade muttered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Enough.” The colonel infused her tone with cold finality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Have you made a decision?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighed, looking tired. “Unfortunately, it’s not up to me. Something this significant must be put to a vote.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Then call an emergency meeting,” Tegan suggested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI agreed with her. We couldn’t afford to let people sleep. The colonel considered, then nodded at Morgan. “Go wake up the rest of the council. Get them here in the next half hour. These four need an answer, either way. I suspect you’ll be returning home to fight, regardless of the result.” She addressed the final statement to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yes, ma’am.” Fade had internalized lessons about respectful modes of address faster than I did.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe put a hand on my shoulder. I was glad she didn’t choose Fade for this gesture, as it wouldn’t end well. “Are you hungry? The least I can do is feed you while you wait.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That would be welcome,” Stalker answered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eColonel Park turned to one of her advisors. “Get something warm for them to eat. There should still be soup on the hearth in the mess.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin minutes, we all had hearty stew and bread to clean the bowls with. I perched on a chair at the edge of the room, and the others followed suit. It was quiet while we ate, then shortly thereafter, five more people stumbled into the room, three men, two women, which gave equal power to both genders. I was pleased to see that parity, even as I finished my meal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What’s the meaning of this?” a gray-haired man demanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuccinctly, the colonel summarized what I’d told her, then she added, “We need to vote at once as to whether we’re sending aid.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA round, motherly-looking woman with fine blond hair put her fingers to her mouth in alarm. “If the Muties have organized, it won’t be long before they march on us.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My thoughts exactly,” the colonel said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey debated for a while. With a full stomach and an aching heart, I didn’t attend to the proceedings. It only mattered what they decided, not how they came to consensus. Tegan slipped up beside me, looking determined. Wordless, she indicated my wound and I offered my arm for her to treat. I bit back a curse as the cleansing liquid trickled over the scratches, deep runnels across the top of my arm, adding a counterpoint to the healed scars on my inner forearms, courtesy of the enclave. I was proud of those six scars still, though maybe I shouldn’t be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she was finished, she smeared salve on me and bandaged the injury with quiet efficiency. Then she whispered, “Fade won’t let me treat him.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Let me try.” Once, he’d permitted me to do so. I didn’t know whether he would, now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTegan handed me her supplies and I crept over to where Fade sat, propped against the wall. The ongoing debate washed over me, bits of argument about the viability of offering support to a settlement with whom they had no such defensive accord, only trade agreements. Then the counter-argument came, mostly about how if Salvation fell, Soldier’s Pond would be next. I stopped listening again as I stilled. Fade opened his eyes, dark and wary in the candlelight. The flickering shadows painted his face hollow beneath his cheekbones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Your shoulder will fester if it’s not cleaned and wrapped,” I said softly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis flinch was nearly imperceptible, then he pushed out a breath. “I’d prefer you to do it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHappiness sang inside me. He still trusted me more than anyone else, whatever his other problems might be. “Then brace. It will sting, but I’ll make it fast.” \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/horde-razorland-3/page-3.html","bookId":1654,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:52:42 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:52:42 PM"}
