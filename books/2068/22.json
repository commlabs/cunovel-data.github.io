Ladies walked around town in midafternoon in wool coats and shawls, and the evenings were cloudy and starless. Out in the field, workers fretted about an early frost. Still, that didn\u0027t stop people from as far away as Atlanta coming into town for the ball. The boarding-house was full, and the entire town had a carnival-like air in the days leading up to the event.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDamon was back at Veritas, his mysterious tenure with the brigade over. I hadn\u0027t told him that Katherine and I were attending the Founders Ball, and he hadn\u0027t asked. Instead, I\u0027d busied myself with work, feeling renewed vigor about taking over Veritas. I wanted to prove to Father that I was serious about the estate and about growing up and assuming my place in the world. He\u0027d been giving me more responsibility, allowing me to look over the ledgers and even encouraging me to go to Richmond with Robert to attend a livestock auction. I could see my life, ten years from now. I\u0027d run Veritas, and Katherine would run the inside of the home, hosting parties and playing the occasional card game at night with Father.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe night of the ball, Alfred knocked on my door. \"Sir? Do you require any assistance?\" he asked as I swung the door open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced at my reflection in the mirror. I was dressed in a black long-tailed coat and tie, with my hair slicked back. I looked older, more confident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlfred followed my gaze. \"Looking smart, sir,\" he allowed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you. I\u0027m ready,\" I said, my heart fluttering in excitement. Last night, Katherine had teased me mercilessly, not giving me any clues as to what she was going to wear. I couldn\u0027t wait to see her. I knew she\u0027d be the most beautiful girl at the ball. More important, she was mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI headed down the stairs, relieved that Damon was nowhere to be found. I wondered whether he was attending the Founders Ball with some of his army friends or perhaps one of the town\u0027s girls. He\u0027d been distant lately, impossible to find in the morning and at the tavern at night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOutside, the horses were pawing at the drive. I entered the waiting coach, which clip-clopped its way to the carriage house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI glanced out the window, and noticed Katherine and Emily standing at the front door. Emily wore a simple black silk dress, but Katherine ...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had to press my back into the carriage seat to keep from jumping out of the moving coach. Her dress was emerald green, nipping in at the waist dress was emerald green, nipping in at the waist before flowing over her hips. The bodice was low and tight and showed off her creamy white skin, and her hair was pulled back on the top of her head, exposing her graceful, swan-like neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second Alfred pulled back on the horses\u0027 reins, I opened the door of the coach and hopped out, smiling broadly as Katherine\u0027s eyes caught mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stefan!\" Katherine breathed, lifting her skirts slightly as she glided down the stairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Katherine.\" I gently kissed her cheek before I offered my arm to her. Together, we turned and walked toward the carriage, where Alfred stood with the door open.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe road to Mystic Falls was filled with unfamiliar coaches of all shapes and sizes, leading to the Lockwood mansion on the far end of town. I felt a thrill of anticipation. This was the first time I\u0027d ever escorted a girl to the Founders Ball. In all previous years, I\u0027d spent most of the evenings playing poker with my friends. Invariably some sort of disaster happened. Last year, Matthew Hartnett had gotten drunk on whiskey and had accidentally unhitched the horses from his parents\u0027 coach, and two years ago, Nathan Layman had gotten into a fistfight with Grant Vanderbilt, and both ended up with broken noses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe slowly made our way up to the mansion, finally reaching the front walk. Alfred stopped the horses and let us out. I laced my fingers with Katherine\u0027s, and together we walked through the open doors of the mansion and headed toward the dining room.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe high-ceilinged room had been cleared of all furniture, and the candlelight lent a warm, mysterious glow to the walls. A band in the corner played Irish reels, and couples were already beginning to dance, even though the night was young. I squeezed Katherine\u0027s hand, and she smiled up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Stefan!\" I whirled around and saw Mr. and Mrs. Cartwright. I dropped Katherine\u0027s hand immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Cartwright\u0027s eyes were red, and she was positively gaunt compared to the last time I saw her. Meanwhile, Mr. Cartwright seemed to have aged ten years. His hair was snow-white, and he was walking with the aid of a cane. Both wore purple sprigs of vervain--a tuft stuck out of Mr. Cartwright\u0027s breast pocket, and the flowers were woven into Mrs. Cartwright\u0027s hat--but other than that, they were clad entirely in black, for mourning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. and Mrs. Cartwright,\" I said, my stomach clenching with guilt. In truth, I\u0027d nearly forgotten that Rosalyn and I had been engaged. \"It\u0027s good to see you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Y could have seen us sooner if you\u0027d come\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eou to call on us,\" Mr. Cartwright said. He could barely hide the contempt in his voice when his gaze landed on Katherine. \"But I understand you must have been in deep ... grief as well.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will come now that I know you\u0027re taking visitors,\" I said lamely, tugging at my collar, which suddenly felt quite tight around my neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No need,\" Mrs. Cartwright said icily as she reached into her sleeve to pull out a handkerchief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine clasped Mrs. Cartwright\u0027s hand. Mrs. Cartwright looked down, an expression of shock on her face. A wave of apprehension ran through me, and I fought the urge to step between them and shield Katherine from their anger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then Katherine smiled, and amazingly, both Cartwrights smiled back. \"Mr. and Mrs. Cartwright, I am so sorry for your loss,\" she said warmly, holding their gazes. \"I lost my parents during the Atlanta siege, and I know how hard it is. I didn\u0027t know Rosalyn well, but I do know she will never be forgotten.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Cartwright blew her nose noisily, her eyes watering. \"Thank you, dear,\" she said reverentially.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMr. Cartwright patted his wife on the back. \"Y thank you.\" He turned to me, compassion\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ees, replacing the scorn that had occupied his eyes just moments earlier. \"And please take care of Stefan. I know he\u0027s suffering.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine smiled as the couple rejoined the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gaped in amazement. \"Did you compel them? \" I asked, the word tasting bitter in my mouth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Katherine placed her hand over her heart. \"That was good, old-fashioned kindness. Now, let\u0027s dance,\" she said, tugging me toward the large ballroom. Luckily, the dance floor was a crush of bodies and the lighting was low, so it was almost impossible to make out specific people. Flower garlands hung from the ceiling, and the marble floor was waxed to a sheen. The air was hot and cloying, with the scent of hundreds of competing perfumes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hand on Katherine\u0027s shoulders and tried to relax into the waltz. But I still felt jumpy. The conversation with the Cartwrights had stirred my conscience, making me feel vaguely disloyal to Rosalyn\u0027s memory, and to Damon. Had I betrayed him somehow by not telling him that Katherine and I were at the ball together? Was it wrong that I\u0027d been grateful for his prolonged absences?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe band stopped, and as women adjusted their dresses and grasped their partners\u0027 hands again, I headed toward the refreshment table in the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you all right, Stefan?\" Katherine asked, gliding up beside me, worry lines creasing her lovely forehead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nodded, but I didn\u0027t break my stride. \"Just thirsty,\" I lied.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me too.\" Katherine stood expectantly as I ladled the dark-red punch into a crystal tumbler. I passed the glass to her and watched as she drank deeply, wondering if that was what she looked like when she drank blood. When she placed the glass on the table, she had the slightest trace of red liquid around her mouth. I couldn\u0027t help it. With my index finger I wiped the drop off the side of her bow-shaped mouth. Then I put my finger in my own mouth. It tasted sweet and tangy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Are you sure you\u0027re all right?\" Katherine asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m worried about Damon,\" I confessed as I poured myself a glass of punch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But why?\" Katherine asked, genuine confusion registering on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because of you,\" I said simply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine took the tumbler from me and led me away from the refreshment table. \"He\u0027s like a brother to me,\" she said, touching my brow with her icy fingers. \"I\u0027m like his little sister. Y know\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eou this.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But all those times when I was sick? When you and he were together? It seemed like ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seemed like I needed a friend,\" Katherine said firmly. \"Damon\u0027s a flirt. He doesn\u0027t want to be tied down, nor would I want to be tied to him. Y ou are my love, and Damon is my brother.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll around us, couples swirled in the semi- darkness, dipping in time to the music and laughing gaily at private jokes, seemingly without a care in the world. They, too, had to worry about attacks and the war and heartbreak, but they still laughed and danced. Why couldn\u0027t I as well? Why did I always have to doubt myself? I glanced at Katherine. A dark curl had come loose from her updo. I tucked it behind her ear, relishing the silky feel of the strands between my fingers. Longing coursed through me, and as I stared into her deep brown eyes, all feelings of guilt and unease vanished.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shall we dance?\" asked Katherine, taking my hand and pressing it to her cheek.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the crowded dance floor, I spotted Father, Mr. Cartwright, and the rest of the Founders whispering furiously in a far corner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" I whispered huskily. \"Let\u0027s go home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed Katherine\u0027s shoulder, and we whirled around the dance floor until we reached the kitchen, where servants were busily preparing refreshments. Hand in hand, we tore through the kitchen--much to the confusion of the servants --and exited at the back of the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe sprinted into the night, oblivious to the cold air, the shrieks of laughter from the mansion, and the fact that we\u0027d just run out on the social event of the season.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe coach was tied near the Lockwoods\u0027 stable. Alfred was no doubt playing craps with the other servants. \"After you, my lady,\" I said, lifting Katherine by the waist and placing her in the passenger seat. I hoisted myself up to the driver\u0027s seat and cracked the whip, which immediately caused the horses to start clip-clopping in the direction of home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grinned at Katherine. We had an entire evening of freedom in front of us, and it was intoxicating. No having to sneak into the carriage house. No skirting the servants. Just hours of uninterrupted bliss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I love you!\" I yelled, but the wind stole the words as soon as they left my mouth. I imagined them traveling with the breeze, floating through the entire world until every person in every town knew of my love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine stood up in the coach, her curls whipping wildly around her face. \"I love you, too!\" she shouted, and then collapsed into giggles on the seat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time we got back to the carriage house, we were both sweaty and red-cheeked. The second we reached Katherine\u0027s chambers, I pulled the dress off her slim frame and, seized by my passion, gently ran my teeth against her neck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you doing?\" She stepped back and stared at me sharply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m just ...\" What was I doing? Playacting? Trying to seem as if Katherine and I were the same? \"I guess I wanted to know how you feel when you ...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKatherine bit her lip. \"Maybe someday you\u0027ll find out, my innocent, sweet Stefan.\" She lay back on the bed, arranging her hair on the snow-white goose-down pillow. \"But right now, all I want is you. \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lay down next to her, tracing the curve of her chin with my index finger as I put my lips to hers. The kiss was so soft and tender that I felt her essence and mine combine, creating a force that was larger than ourselves. We explored each other\u0027s bodies as if for the first time. In the dim light of her chambers, I was never sure where reality ended and my dreams began. There was no shame, no expectation, just passion and desire, and a sense of danger that was mysterious and beautiful and consuming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat night, I would have allowed Katherine to consume me entirely and claim me for her own. I would have gladly offered up my neck if it meant that we could have stayed locked in that embrace for all of eternity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stefan-s-diaries-origins-the-vampire-diaries-1/page-22.html","bookId":2068,"creation":"Oct 6, 2019 12:20:40 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:20:40 AM"}
