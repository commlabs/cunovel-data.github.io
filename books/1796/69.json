As long as she stayed in the bedroom she would be all right, he told himself. There was no reason why she and Spencer should have encountered each other this morning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flashlight darted past, accompanied by a lot of heavy breathing. Spencer was in a state of panic—Jonas could literally smell the fear on the man.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas stepped out from behind a fir and threw himself forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No!\" Spencer shrieked as he was toppled to the ground. \"No, goddammit, no. Let me go, you frigging bastard. Take your damned hands off me. Let me go!\" He lurched beneath Jonas\u0027s weight, swinging wildly with the flashlight and something else—a gun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas slashed at the Sailing arm holding the pistol. Spencer fought back with an unnatural strength. The man was clearly hysterical and he struggled with frantic energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe flashlight caught Jonas on his jaw. He reeled backward, seeing a few bright lights in his head. But he had a grip on Spencer\u0027s gun arm and he hung on with grim determination, squeezing until he was sure the small bones in Spencer\u0027s wrist had to crack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer screamed, a high, thin wail of despair and fury, and then the gun tumbled to the soggy ground.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas drew back his arm for a solid blow, then abandoned the effort in disgust. There was no point in hitting his victim again. Spencer was racked with heavy sobs, totally incapacitated by his emotions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was an accident,\" Slade gasped between gulping sobs. He lay in the mud, one arm over his face. \"A damned accident. I didn\u0027t plan it. She just showed up at the wrong time. Started yelling at me, saying she knew all about me. I had to do something, don\u0027t you see? I had to shut her up.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCold terror swept over Jonas. He grabbed a fistful of Slade\u0027s shirt and jerked him to a sitting position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who did you shut up, Spencer? Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer blinked, his gaze oddly vague. \"That old bag Frampton. What else could I do? She knew, I tell you. Somehow she figured out who I was.\" Spencer swallowed more sobs. \"Shit, I didn\u0027t think she\u0027d recognize me. I lost a lot of weight in the clinic—got contacts—shaved my beard. I was so damn sure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut she knew me, the old bitch. She knew me. So I hit her and she fell, like a sack of laundry. She just fell, I tell you. I didn\u0027t mean to kill her.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spite of what he was hearing, a sickening sense of relief swept through Jonas. His first thought had been that it was Verity whom Spencer had killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You killed Maggie? This morning?\" He shook Spencer. \"Answer me, dammit!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Have to get away. Everything\u0027s gone wrong.\" Spencer gazed wildly about, his eyes glazed. \"Hazelhurst said it would. He always claimed the treasure was protected with a curse or something. Stupid old man—crazy. He was crazy, you know. I mean, those ass**les in the clinic said I had a few screws loose, but Hazelhurst was downright insane.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJonas had his doubts about who was crazy and who wasn\u0027t, but this wasn\u0027t the time to explore them. It sounded as if Verity was all right, but he had to get back to the villa and make certain. Then he had to find poor Maggie Frampton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You crazy son of a bitch,\" Jonas said. \"You killed Hazelhurst, didn\u0027t you?\" He unbuckled Spencer\u0027s belt as he spoke. \"You were the student who showed up two years ago to help him look for the treasure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaggie finally recognized you this morning, didn\u0027t she? Is that what happened? She said she knew who you were?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had to kill Hazelhurst,\" Spencer explained, his expression suddenly, chillingly sane. \"He was afraid, you see. Lost his nerve. Wouldn\u0027t tell me what he\u0027d done with the treasure, said no one must ever touch it. All that was left in the chest was a ring, a scrap of metal, and a stiletto. I knew Hazelhurst had gotten there first and found the rest. I tried to make him tell me, but he wouldn\u0027t. The old bastard just kept saying the chest was empty when he found it. But I knew better.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you killed him with the stiletto you found in the chest, right?\" Jonas dragged Spencer to his feet and secured his wrists behind his back with the belt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I had to kill him. He was so freakin\u0027 scared. The old fool wouldn\u0027t tell me a thing, but I knew I could find it on my own. It had to be there in the villa. I didn\u0027t need him to tell me where it was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But you never found the treasure, did you?\" Jonas asked as he jerked Spencer back toward the villa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve killed two people but all you ever got was a ring, a drug and alcohol problem, and a few loose screws. Maybe Hazelhurst was right. Maybe the treasure is cursed. You should have left well enough alone. Tell me something, how did you get that rental boat over here? Doug brought you here in his launch, didn\u0027t he?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was easy. As soon as I knew about the plans to spend a week at the villa, I rented the boat. Then I hired a kid who had his own boat to follow me here. I hid the boat in that first cove and the kid gave me a lift back to the other island. I told him I planned to use the skiff for a fishing party this week.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why did you think you\u0027d need a boat?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer looked at Jonas as if he were the crazy one. \"To get off this damned island in case things went wrong.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The way they did this morning?\" Jonas asked harshly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got scared after I had to hit that old busybody. But you know, now that I think about it, there\u0027s no need to be afraid, is there? Nobody can prove I killed Hazelhurst, even if someone does find his body.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept the old bag. When she recognized me, she started getting suspicious. Told me she\u0027d been watching me, even went through my things one night. She found me in that torture chamber this morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What were you doing in the torture chamber at this hour?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlade wiped the back of his hand across his mouth, his eyes haunted. \"I finally decided I had to have another look at that goddamned treasure room. I didn\u0027t want to go back into that horrible tunnel but I had to. The secret\u0027s in there somewhere, I\u0027m sure of it. I was awake all night thinking about it. I\u0027ve been afraid you might stumble onto the tunnel somehow, even though I tore the last pages out of Hazelhurst\u0027s diary. I finally figured out that I had no choice but to go back inside. Jesus, I hate that tunnel. So much darkness.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"And Maggie found you there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She must have been watching me all night, waiting for me, the bitch. Accused me of having done something to Hazelhurst a couple of years ago. Started screaming like a madwoman, wouldn\u0027t shut up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe damn bitch would not shut her goddamned mouth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you hit her.\" \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gift-of-fire-gift-2/page-69.html","bookId":1796,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:23:39 PM"}
