Taller than most women, though, and terrible thin. She - it - had long dark hair. Brown or black, I couldn\u0027t say. The thing had tits, I seen \u0027em clear enough. Then I seen what else it had, and I near staggered and fell.\" Buckner leaned his head forward, the veins standing out in his neck. \"Stones and a yard. Right there where a woman\u0027s basket oughta be. That yard was ready for work, too, and when the witch seen it she smiled so wicked it near froze my heart. The creature laid down a\u0027side her, and then she started to . . . started to lickin\u0027 the creature\u0027s spike.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By \u0027she,\u0027 you are referring to whomi\" Woodward asked. \"Her. In the cage there. The witch, Rachel Howarth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"all right.\" Woodward again mopped the sweat from his face. The walls of the gaol seemed to be closing in on him. The one saving grace was the open hatch, through which he could see a square of gray clouds. \"Continue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There was just. . . more sin and vileness after that. The witch turned over, on her hands and knees, so her rear quarters was showin\u0027. Then that half-man, half-woman took its spike in hand and squatted down atop her. I saw . . . things no Christian should e\u0027er have to witness, sir. I tell you, before I seen them sights I was all right in the head. Now I ain\u0027t. You ask my Patience. She\u0027ll tell you, I\u0027m no good for nothin\u0027 no more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"This creature that was half-man and half-woman penetrated Madam Howarth with its penisi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes sir. The creature pushed its yard in from behind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Let us move past those particulars,\" Woodward said, his face blanched. \"What was the aftermath of this incidenti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The what, siri\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The aftermath. What happened after the creature had ...\" He paused, seeking the proper word, \"... finishedi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It got up off her and walked away. Then the witch stood up and took to dressin\u0027 herself. all a\u0027 sudden I heard my name spoke, right up next to my ear, and I whipped \u0027round to see who it be.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"and did you seei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well ... I was mighty scairt. There was a man standin\u0027 behind me . . . but I don\u0027t think he had no face. \u0027Cept a mouth. He did have a mouth ... I \u0027member that. He said, \u0027Jeremiah Buckner, run home.\u0027 That\u0027s all. I must\u0027a done what he said, \u0027cause next thing I knew I was a\u0027layin\u0027 in bed, sweatin\u0027 and shakin\u0027. Patience was hard asleep, conjured most likely. I heard a cock crow, and I knew then that the demons of the night was passin\u0027.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you in the morning, then, tell your wife what had happenedi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No sir, I didn\u0027t. I was shamed to tell Patience such things. and I was scairt, too, that the witch might kill her for hearin\u0027. I didn\u0027t tell nobody, not even after I heard what Elias Garrick seen. Then Lester Crane told me Stephen Dunton seen such a thing- -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;them three creatures with the witch, \u0027cept they was doin\u0027 their wickedness inside the house where the Poole family used to live, right next to Dunton\u0027s farm. Still I held my tongue.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What made you decide to tell what you\u0027d seeni\" Woodward asked. \"and who did you telli\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I decided . . . after they found them poppets in the witch\u0027s house. I went straight to Mr. Bidwell and told him all of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I should like to speak to Mr. Dunton,\" Woodward said to Matthew. \"Make a note of that, please.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Cain\u0027t,\" Buckner said. \"He took his family and they left, back two month ago. Dunton\u0027s house since burnt down. Lester Crane and his brood lit out \u0027bout the same time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoodward paused for a moment, ordering his thoughts. \"Did you know Daniel Howarthi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes sir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of man was hei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, he was but a youngster. Maybe forty, forty-five year old. Big man, he was. Took a right demon to lay him low, I\u0027ll grant you!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Did you have occasion to see Mr. Howarth and his wife togetheri\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, not much. Daniel kept to hisself. Wasn\u0027t a social kind of man.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"and what about his wifei Was she sociali\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well ... I don\u0027t know about such. Daniel and that woman been here maybe three year. He had a sizable piece a\u0027 land, bought it from a Dutchman named Niedecker. That man\u0027s wife had passed in childbirth, the child died too, so he decided to give it up. Daniel was always a quiet man. Never needed much help at anythin\u0027, seemed like.\" Buckner shrugged. \"The woman . . . well, mayhap she did try to be social. But it just caused a stir.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"a stiri What kind of stiri\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Look at her, sir. If you can bear it, after what I\u0027ve told you. She\u0027s betwixt a nigger and a Spaniard. Would you care to share a pew with heri\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The witch attended churchi\" Woodward raised his eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That was \u0027fore she took to witchcraft,\" Buckner explained. \"She only come to church two or three Sabbaths. Wouldn\u0027t nobody sit near her. Them Port\u0027a\u0027geeze got a whiff about \u0027em.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So she was not welcome in church, is that correcti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She could do and go as she pleased. Wasn\u0027t nobody gonna stop her from enterin\u0027 Our Lord\u0027s house. But I recall the last time she showed up, somebody - and I know who it was, but I ain\u0027t sayin\u0027 - pelted her with a rotten egg a\u0027fore she could come in. Hit her right a\u0027side the face. You know what she donei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whati\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She sat down in a pew with that egg smellin\u0027 as it did, that mess all in her hair, and she nary made a move \u0027til Reverend Grove said the last Praise and amen \u0027bout four hours later. \u0027Course, he did rush it some, that smell in the church as it was.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew was aware of a movement from the corner of his eye. He looked up as he finished scribing the last line - and there was Rachel Howarth, standing next to the bars, her teeth gritted and an expression of sheer ferocity on her face. Her right arm was lifted and swinging forward, a gesture of violence that made Matthew shout, \"Magistrate!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe shout itself most possibly caused Woodward to lose the remaining few hairs on his scalp. He twisted his head around as well, and Buckner gave a garbled cry of terror and raised a hand to protect his face from what he was sure would be Satanic flame.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a loud crack! at the end of the woman\u0027s blow against the bars. Fragments of dark reddish-brown clay fell into the straw. Matthew saw that in her right hand was the cup\u0027s grip, the rest of it smashed to smithereens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I am done with my tea,\" Rachel said. She opened her hand and dropped the largest bit of the cup into their cell. \"That is how Lucretia Vaughan wanted it returned, is it noti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it is. and thank you, Matthew, for your help in emptying my bladder. Will you collect those pieces for me, pleasei\" The magistrate blotted his face with his sleeve and attempted mightily to control his galloping heart. Matthew had to bend down on his knees and reach into the woman\u0027s cell to gather up all the shards. She stood over him, an intimidating presence to begin with but now - due to farmer Buckner\u0027s tale - absolutely fearsome, even though Matthew had the benefit of clear-headed reasoning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wait,\" she said as he started to rise. Her hand came down and plucked up a small piece he\u0027d missed. \"Take this one, too.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe placed it in his outstretched palm, which he immediately withdrew between the bars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoodward put the fragments into Madam Vaughan\u0027s basket. \"Let us continue, please, though my mind is as shambled as that broken cup.\" He rubbed his temples with both hands. \"Matthew, do you have any questions for the witnessi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir, I do,\" he answered readily, and then he prepared to scribe his own inquiry. \"Mr. Buckner, how long have you depended on that canei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My canei Oh . . . eight, nine year. My bones are poorly.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand that you were terrified that night in the orchard. Terror can strengthen a man\u0027s legs, I know. But when the person behind you said, \u0027Jeremiah, run home,\u0027 did you actually runi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know. But I must\u0027a, \u0027cause I got back to my bed.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t recall runningi You recall no pain to your legsi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" Buckner said. \"I don\u0027t recall.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"By which door did you enter your housei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Which doori Well... I reckon the back door.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t remember which doori\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Jus\u0027 two doors,\" Buckner said with a snort. \"Back \u0027n front. I was behind the house, so I must\u0027a gone in the back un.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was it cold that nighti\" Matthew asked, as he dipped the quill once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It was February, like I say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir. But my question to you is: was it cold that nighti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sure it was. Had to be cold, a February night!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know for certain whether it was cold or noti You don\u0027t recall it being coldi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not on trial here, am Ii\" Buckner looked to the magistrate for help. \"What\u0027s he poundin\u0027 the nail fori\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is there some point to this, Matthewi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"\\es, sir, there is. If you\u0027ll bear with mei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"all right, then.\" Woodward nodded. \"But please remember that Mr. Buckner is a witness, not a defendant.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Buckner, when you rose from bed to go outside in the cold February night, did you pause to put on any outer garmentsi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Outer garmentsi What\u0027re you goin\u0027 on abouti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"a coat,\" Matthew said. \"a cloak. a hat. Gloves. Surely you paused to at least put on shoes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuckner scowled. \"Well... of course I put on shoes!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"and a coati\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I reckon I put on a coat too! Do you think me a fooli\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir, I do not. But you don\u0027t sound very certain about those details. Tell me this, then: when you heard the cock crow, were you lying in bed with your shoes and coat still oni\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whati\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You testified that you were lying in bed, sweating and shaking. Did you pause at some point to remove your shoes and coat before you got into bedi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\" It was said with faint conviction. \"I must\u0027a.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t recalli\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was scairt. Like I said, scairt half dead!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about your canei\" Matthew asked. \"You did take your cane outside with you, did you noti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I did. I cain\u0027t hardly get \u0027round wirhout it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where did you put your cane when you returned from the orchardi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I . . . put it. . .\" He pressed his fingers against his mouth. \"I put it... in the corner next to the bed, I reckon.

You did so because you didn\u0027t wish your wife to know you\u0027d been outside, could that be correcti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, it could.\" He nodded vigorously. \"That must be the why of it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir, if you had decided to do so, why did you believe you took it off and laid it at the foot of the bedi Is it so unclear in your mind where you left your coati\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I was conjured!

Like I say, after what I seen I ain\u0027t right in the head no more.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Buckneri\" Matthew stared forcefully into the man\u0027s eyes. \"You have given us a story of amazing details, seen without the benefit of illumination. Why is it, then, that your grasp of details is so hazy both before and after the incident in the orchardi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuckner\u0027s face tightened. \"You think I\u0027m lyin\u0027, don\u0027t youi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mr. Buckner,\" Woodward spoke up, \"no one has said that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Don\u0027t have to say it!

He hobbled to his feet and pointed at Rachel Howarth. \"There\u0027s the witch I seen with them three demons from Hell! I seen it was her, no mis-takin\u0027 it! She\u0027s evil to her black heart, and if you think I\u0027m lyin\u0027 she\u0027s conjured you, too!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sir,\" Woodward said quietly, trying to calm the man. \"Please.

I ain\u0027t answerin\u0027 nothin\u0027 more!\" The old man abruptly turned and walked out of the cell, leaning heavily on his cane.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoodward also stood up. \"Mr. Buckner! Please! Just a few moments longer!\" His entreaties were in vain, however. Buckner stalked away and was gone from the gaol altogether.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He can be convinced to return,\" Matthew said. \"He\u0027ll listen to Bidwell.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I only had two or three more questions to ask.\" Woodward cast a dark glare at his clerk. \"What was the meaning of badgering the man like thati\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t think I was badgering, sir. I was clarifying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You took that man to task, Matthew! You just as well said you believed him a liar!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No, sir,\" Matthew replied evenly, \"I never said such a thing. I simply desired to know why he couldn\u0027t recall some specific details, when other specifics were so very clear. I should think he would remember putting on and removing his coat and shoes, no matter what kind of fright he\u0027d experienced.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well, the man\u0027s not a liar!\" Woodward vowed. \"Confused, possibly. Frightened, certainly. But I don\u0027t believe him the stripe of man who would make up such phantasms, do youi I mean . . . dear God, if he was concocting such a tale, I\u0027d fear his mind was diseased beyond all salvation!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere came a laugh. Matthew and Woodward looked into the next cage. Rachel Howarth was sitting on her bench, her back against the rough wall and her head uptilted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You find this amusing, madami\" Woodward inquired.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No,\" she said. \"I find it sad. But as I am far past tears, I must laugh instead of weep.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Laugh or weep as you please. This is damning evidence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evidencei\" again, she laughed. \"What evidence is therei an insane tale told by an old mani Oh, there is some truth in what he told you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"are you admitting your concordance with the Devil, theni\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all. I\u0027m admitting that I attended church on three Sabbaths, and the third time I sat with a rotten egg in my hair. But I was not going to give them the pleasure of watching me run home, or seeing me sob like a wounded child. That\u0027s the only truth in Buckner\u0027s story.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course you would deny the incident in the orchard. I wouldn\u0027t expect you to do otherwise.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What was the point of it, theni\" She turned her amber gaze upon him. \"If I am such a witch, why did I choose to invite Buckner to watch my . . . indiscretionsi Why would I not want to do such things in privatei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t know, madam. Why did you noti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Evidently, according to Buckner, I can walk through latched doors. Why am I still here in this cage, theni\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It would be an admission of witchcraft to leave this gaol.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"and allowing Buckner to witness that profanity was not an admissioni\" She shook her head. \"If I really were a witch, I\u0027d be much more clever than that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, I think you\u0027re clever enough. Besides, madam, who is to say you do not leave this gaol at night, and roam where you please with your masteri Possibly you inhabit some spectral world of which God-fearing citizens dare not imagine.\u0027\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might ask your clerk tomorrow morning,\" Rachel said. \"He\u0027ll find out tonight if I have the power to walk through walls.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I doubt that you would show any such power while Matthew is present,\" Woodward parried. \"again, it would be an admission of guilt that would lead to your appointment at the stake.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe suddenly stood up. \"You must be as insane as the rest of them! Do you honestly think, after what you heard today, that I am not going to burni There are other witnesses - other liars -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;yet to speak against me, I know. But who will speak for mei No one. Oh, they hated me here before they took me to be a witch, so they made me into one, the better to hate all the stronger!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They made you into a witchi How could you be made into what you are noti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Hear me well, Magistrate. Someone murdered Reverend Grove and my husband, and then fashioned me into the blackest witch south of Salem. Someone made poppets and hid them in the floor of my house. Someone spread these filthy lies about me, so that now the people here don\u0027t know their own minds!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I believe Mr. Buckner,\" Woodward said. \"I\u0027ve seen liars before, in many courtrooms. I\u0027ve seen them spin webs from which they cannot escape. Mr. Buckner may be confused about some small details, due to his advanced age and the experience of that night, but he is not lying.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If he\u0027s not lying,\" Rachel answered, \"then he\u0027s either in need of an asylum or he\u0027s been cursed by some witch other than the one I am painted to be. I never set foot in his house or that orchard. I swear it before God.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beware your mouth, madam! a bolt of holy fire might end your games.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If it would be a quicker death than the stake, I would welcome it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew said, \"There\u0027s a simple way to end all of this. Madam, if you would recite the Lord\u0027s Prayer, I think the magistrate might consider your case in a different light.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll speak for myself, thank you!\" Woodward said. \"after what I\u0027ve heard here today, I think even a recitation of the Lord\u0027s Prayer might be a trick provided by this woman\u0027s master!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will save you the wondering,\" Rachel said, \"because I refuse to speak such a thing that has no meaning in this town. Those who babble the Lord\u0027s Prayer day and night would be first to grin when I\u0027m set afire. Like Lucretia Vaughan, for instance. Oh, there\u0027s a fine Christian example! She would\u0027ve given Christ on the cross a drink of vinegar and called it honey!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She was kind enough to provide you a cup for tea. I didn\u0027t find it vinegared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t know her as I do. I believe I know why she wanted the cup broken and returned. ask her yourself. You might be enlightened.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoodward busied himself by putting the teapot and the remaining cups back into the basket. \"I think that will do for today, Matthew. I\u0027m off to visit Dr. Shields. On Monday morning we shall resume our interviews.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027d suggest, sir, that our next witness be Mrs. Buckner. I have some questions I\u0027d like to pose.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do you, nowi\" Woodward paused, his cheeks showing a flame. \"Who is presiding over this court, you or mei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You are, of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then shouldn\u0027t I be the one who determines the next witnessi and since I do not have any questions for Mrs. Buckner, I suggest Mr. Garrick come to court on Monday morning.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I understand that you are the authority in this court, as in any other,\" Matthew said, with a slight bow of his head, \"but shouldn\u0027t Mrs. Buckner be asked to describe her husband\u0027s mental state during the period of time that - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mrs. Buckner should be left alone,\" the magistrate interrupted. \"She was asleep during both incidents her husband related. I daresay Mr. Buckner has never told her what he saw. Would you bring a decent Christian wife into this gaol, within earshot of Madam Howarthi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She would be brought into any other courtroom.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"at the discretion of the judge. In my opinion, she has nothing to add, and indeed might even suffer harm by being called to appear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Magistrate,\" Matthew said quietly, \"a wife knows her husband. I would like to learn whether Mr. Buckner has had . . . shall we say . . . delusions of any kind in previous years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re saying that what he witnessed was a delusion, remember that it was a delusion shared by another person. Stephen Dunton, wasn\u0027t that the man\u0027s namei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir. But as Mr. Dunton is no longer present, we only have Mr. Buckner\u0027s word.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sworn on the Bible. Delivered in a rational manner. Told in as stomach-churning detail as I ever hope to hear. His word is good enough for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But not good enough for me,\" Matthew said. The rawly honest thought had left his mouth before he could constrain it. If Woodward\u0027s teeth had been false, they might have dropped to the floor. The silence stretched, as the magistrate and his clerk stared at each other.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoodward\u0027s throat was ravaged, his air passages swollen, and his bones aching in the damp, close heat. He had just heard a reliable witness relate a story of both fascination and horror that brought a woman - a human being, even if she was a notorious witch - nearer the stake. He felt sick to his very marrow, and now this audacity added to his freight was enough to lay him low. \"You\u0027ve forgotten your place,\" he rasped. \"You are a clerk, not a magistrate. Not even - though you seem to wish it - an attorney. Your duty is as a scrivener, not a questioner. The former you do very well, the latter undoes you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew didn\u0027t respond except for the flush of shame on his face. He realized that he\u0027d spoken completely out of turn and was better off embracing silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I will ascribe this incident to our surroundings and the miserable weather,\" Woodward decided. \"Therefore we shall put this behind us like gentlemen. agreedi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, sir,\" Matthew said, though he still thought it was appropriate - no, vital -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;to interview Buckner\u0027s wife.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Very good, then.\" Woodward picked up the basket in preparation of leaving. \"I\u0027ll ask Mr. Green to come in and move you to one of the cells over there.\" He nodded toward the opposite cages. \"I would prefer that you not be in such close proximity to Madam Howarth.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh ... I\u0027d like to stay where I am, sir,\" Matthew countered quickly. \"I\u0027d appreciate the benefit of the desk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whyi You won\u0027t be needing it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It. . . makes the place seem not such a cage.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh. Yes, I see. Then I\u0027ll have Madam Howarth moved.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There\u0027s no need for that, sir,\" Matthew said. \"The distance of one or two cages hardly matters, if indeed she employs such witchcraft. and I do have this.\" He held up the leatherbound Bible. \"If this isn\u0027t strong enough to protect me, nothing can.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe magistrate paused, glancing from his clerk to Rachel Howarth and back again. This whole situation - Matthew being forced to remain in this wretched place with a woman who\u0027d known such wickedness - gnawed at his nerves. Who knew what Matthew would witness in the dead of nighti He damned himself for passing sentence on the boy, but what other choice had there beeni It crossed his mind to occupy one of the other cages for the night, on some pretext of keeping an eye on Madam Howarth\u0027s activities, but he knew Bidwell and everyone else would see through the flimsy gauze and realize him to be quite less the taskmaster than he appeared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eat the bottom of his pond, far down from the light of public inspection, he was afraid. Fearful of Rachel Howarth, and of what she might do to the boy. Fearful also that once he left Matthew alone with this Devil\u0027s doxy, the boy might never again be the same. The witch\u0027s pleasure would be in destroying innocence, would it noti\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shall be all right,\" Matthew said, reading some of these thoughts in the magistrate\u0027s anguished expression. \"Just go to Dr. Shields and ask for a tonic.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWoodward nodded, but still he couldn\u0027t bear to leave. The time, however, had come. \"I\u0027ll return this afternoon and see to you,\" he said. \"Can I bring you anythingi Books from Mr. Bidwell\u0027s libraryi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, that would be fine. any books will do.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure you will be fed before long. If you\u0027re displeased at the meal, I\u0027ll be glad to bring you - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Whatever the meal is, it will be good enough,\" Matthew told him. \"Just go see Dr. Shields.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes, I shall.\" Woodward turned his attention to the woman, who had resumed sitting on her bench. \"Your actions toward my clerk will be watched and noted, madam,\" he said sternly. \"I strongly suggest you keep your distance.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"My actions needn\u0027t cause you worry,\" she replied. \"But the rats in here are not subject to strong suggestions.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was nothing more that Woodward could do. Matthew would have to fend for himself, and the Lord God be with him. Woodward, basket in hand, left the gaol. In another moment Green entered, closed and locked the door of Matthew\u0027s cage, and then he too retreated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew stood at the bars, staring up toward the open hatch. His fingers were gripping the iron. The sound of the cell\u0027s door being shut had made him think of the iron gate clanging at the almshouse, and sickness roiled in his stomach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027ve not been in here very long to feel the loss of freedom,\" Rachel said quietly. \"What is your sentencei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three days.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"an age!\" She gave a harsh laugh that sounded biting. \"I\u0027ve never been in a gaol before. at least, not on this side of the bars.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither had I. It\u0027s not so bad here, in the daylight. But the darkness is not kind.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Three days,\" Matthew repeated. \"I can bear it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What kind of foolishness is thisi\" Her tone had sharpened. \"Do you think I don\u0027t know you\u0027ve been placed in here to spy on mei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You\u0027re wrong. I am here because I . . . offended the blacksmith.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Oh, of course you did! Well, what shall I do to conjure you tonighti Shall I become a raven and flit from cage to cagei Shall I dance a jig on the air, while Satan plays the fiddlei ah! Why don\u0027t I turn you into a piece of cheese and let the rats tear you apart! Would that impress your magistratei\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sure it might,\" Matthew said evenly. \"But it would do neither of us any good, for if I were crumbs by dawn you would be ashes by noon.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some noon I shall be ashes. Why should it not be tomorrowi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew looked through the bars at Rachel Howarth, who had drawn her legs up beneath herself. \"Not all in this town believe you to be a witch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who does noti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One, at least. as for the name, I don\u0027t feel I should betray the confidence.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"One.\" She smiled thinly. \"That one is not the magistrate, is iti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Well theni It is youi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I have an open mind on such subjects.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"and your magistrate does noti\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Magistrate Woodward,\" Matthew said, \"is a man of honor and conviction. No matter his reaction today, he will act in a tempered fashion. You\u0027ll notice no flames around your feet yet, and after Mr. Buckner\u0027s tale I think the magistrate might be justified in lighting the torch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Buckner!\" Rachel spoke it like a spit. \"He\u0027s insane. I was neither in his home nor in the orchard. I hardly know the man; perhaps I\u0027ve spoken a dozen words to him altogether.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew walked over to his desk and began to arrange the papers into a neat stack. \"He seems to know you well enough. after your display here yesterday, I must wonder if your natural inclination is not to shed your clothing and walk the town.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I shed my clothing for my husband,\" she said. \"No one else. Certainly not in public, and certainly not... for the vile purposes Buckner imagined.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Was that it, theni The imaginings of an old mani\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes! Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew located a particular sheet of paper and read from it. \"Regarding the incident in the orchard, Mr. Buckner says as follows: I didn\u0027t tell nobody, not even after I heard what Elias Garrick seen. Then Lester Crane told me Stephen Dunton seen such a thing -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;them three creatures with the witch, \u0027cept they was doin\u0027 their wickedness inside the house where the Poole family used to live, right next to Dun-ton\u0027s farm.\" He looked up at her. \"How could it be the imaginings of two men, at two different times and two different placesi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe didn\u0027t answer; her face seemed darker and she stared straight ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The testimony of Elias Garrick on Monday morning will add more sticks to your pyre,\" Matthew said. \"are you aware of what he\u0027s going to sayi\" There was no reply. \"I take it that you are. Then we shall hear from a child by the name of Violet adams. I have no knowledge of what she will testify. Do youi\" Silence met his question. \"Whatever it is, it will be doubly damning coming from a child. The magistrate is very sensitive to the testimony of children, and I would advise you to hold your tongue when she is speaking.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No matter what lies she spewsi\" Rachel asked, still staring blankly ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No matter if she swears she witnessed you in a privyhouse accommodating three hundred and three demons. Keep your tongue shackled.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You might care to know,\" Rachel said, \"that the child\u0027s mother is the person who anointed my head with such a perfumed present before the church. Constance adams made no secret of her feelings toward me.\" Rachel\u0027s head turned, and her eyes found Matthew\u0027s. \"You\u0027re the magistrate\u0027s clerk, sworn to abide by his law. If you\u0027re not here to spy for him, then why are you in the least interested in what I might say or not sayi\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew continued straightening the sheets of paper. When he was done, he returned them to the box and closed the lid. It had taken him that long to formulate an answer. \"I have a curiosity for puzzles,\" he said, refusing to meet her gaze. \"I am satisfied only when all the pieces fit to perfection. In this instance ... I feel there are many pieces that have been forced into the wrong positions, and thus are ragged of edge. There are missing pieces that must be found. There are pieces that seem to be correct . . . but are, to me at least, of false shape. That is my interest.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea long silence followed, during which Matthew set about cleaning the quill. Then, \"Do you think I am a witchi\" Rachel asked pointedly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think,\" he replied after some deliberation, \"that this town is the host to a very cunning evil. Whether it is demon or man, it does seem Satanic. More than that, I can\u0027t say.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Neither can I,\" she said. \"But no matter who - or what -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;cut my husband\u0027s throat and masqueraded as me in these filthy performances, I\u0027ll be the one to burn for it.\" Matthew couldn\u0027t deny her statement. That conflagration now seemed very near indeed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLies upon lies, Mrs. Nettles had said. What she needs is a champion of truth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as truth was sparse here, Matthew thought, so were champions. He was a clerk, nothing more. Not a magistrate, not an attorney . . . certainly not a champion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was certain of one thing, though; it had become clear to him, after the sickening ordeal of Buckner\u0027s testimony and the magistrate\u0027s forceful reaction. at the conclusion of these interviews, Woodward would be compelled to immediately order Rachel Howarth put to death. She would burn to the bone in a matter of days after that order had been read to the prisoner. and whose hand would scribe the sentence of deathi\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMatthew\u0027s own, of course. He had done it several times before; it was nothing new.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExcept in this instance, he would go to his own grave pondering the pieces that did not fit, and agonized over the missing why.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe finished cleaning the quill and put it and the inkwell into the box, and then the box went into one of the desk\u0027s drawers -\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;which Winston had obviously cleaned out before carting to the gaol, since the desk was absolutely empty - to await further need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen he stretched himself out in the straw - which was fresh thanks be to Mr. Green - closed his eyes, and tried to rest. It came to him only after a moment that he had reclined as far as possible from the bars that stood between his cage and Rachel Howarth\u0027s, and that in his right hand he gripped the Bible across his chest. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/speaks-the-nightbird-matthew-corbett-1/page-12.html","bookId":2250,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:36 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:10:36 PM"}
