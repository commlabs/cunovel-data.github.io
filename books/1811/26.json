For a man, distance doesn’t make the heart grow fonder, it just provides ample opportunity to find someone else he can stick his dick into. When a guy is really into a woman, he feels the same way about her as he does about Sunday football games—more is always preferable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, I see what Delores is trying to say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis time last week, I offered her casual, but the days that followed have been anything but. They’ve been intense. Consistently frequent. And it’s obviously freaking her the f**k out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen hanging out with the same person every day becomes routine, it’s difficult to remember what your life looked like before . . . or what it might look like after.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough I’m cool with the time Dee and I have been spending together, I don’t want to seem needy. Desperation is a reek that’s impossible to wash off once it’s been sniffed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You need space—sure—I get it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opens the door and steps inside. And she turns back to me and smiles insincerely. “I’ll . . . call you.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI nod.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen she slams the door in my face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe doesn’t call.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot the next day. Or Monday. Or even on the most-holy third day. I haven’t been checking my phone every five minutes or anything . . . but I’ll admit, the sucker’s been fully charged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDelores blew me off. Just . . . f**king wow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I’ve ditched girls in the past—nice girls who didn’t hold my interest. Yes, this is the first time I’ve been on the receiving end of a blow-off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd no—it doesn’t feel good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should forget about her. There are plenty of alternates waiting to step up to bat. I should move onward and upward. Downward is always fun too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI should . . . but I don’t want to. It’s not just that she’s beautiful, wild, and her tits are the stuff wet dreams are made of. More than all of that—Dee’s interesting. Fascinating. Different than any other girl I’ve dated before. The way her mind works, how she teases, challenges me—I could spend day after day just talking to Delores and never get bored.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe makes me think, she makes me laugh . . . she makes me hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd just like a baseball scout can look at a Little Leaguer and see an MVP in the making, I know Dee and I could be great together. Legendary. I feel the potential every time I’m close to her. That’s what keeps my thoughts—and my fantasies—coming back to her. Because with a little time and some extra effort, we’ll both be reaping some sweet rewards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy Tuesday night, I take the bull by the horns—or in this case, the bitch by the ears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI skip the gym and stake out Delores’s apartment building, hell-bent on catching her on her way home from work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe’s walking down the block now, briskly striding in shiny, open-toed heels, a flowy white blouse that billows with every swing of her arms, and a green, snakeskin skirt. I trot down to her. Her chin rises determinedly when she sees me, not missing a step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, stranger.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hi, Matthew.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walk beside her. “How have you been?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Busy.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Too busy to pick up the phone, huh?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Someone call an exorcist—you’ve been possessed by my mother.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grasp her elbow, bringing her to a stop. At first she’s annoyed, but when her eyes meet mine, I feel it. Electricity. Excitement. Her eyes dance over my face, drinking in every detail. And my own relief at seeing her again—after days of settling for paltry memories—is mirrored in her gaze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m not him, Dee.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Who?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Whatever jerk-off made you so ready to run—scared of relationships. Of letting yourself actually f**king feel something . . . want someone . . . the way I know you want me.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe crosses her arms and cocks her hip. “You must not fly very often—the airline’s baggage weight limit is forty pounds. Your enormous head must weigh at least a hundred.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDepends on which head she’s referring to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile. “Very funny.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe turns away, watching the passing cars. And when she speaks her voice is somber. A mixture of sadness and fear. “It wasn’t a ‘who,’ Matthew . . . it was a them. I’ve been here before. There’s no point in sitting through the drama when you already know the ending.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI cup her jaw, brushing the warm, petal softness of her cheek with my thumb. “But I’m not like them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“That’s what they all say, and I let myself believe them. But eventually, the truth comes out, and the guy I cared about—the guy I thought I knew—turns out to be a loser, or a gambler, or married, or just a plain old son of a bitch.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy chest tightens at her wounded expression. At her hurt. And a part of me wants to hunt down every one of the idiots she referred to and smash their faces in for their stupidity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI lean in close, ghosting my lips along her neck. Because I want to overwhelm her so she’ll forget about her doubts and her fears and all the ass**les she’s ever known. And I’ll be the only one she feels—the only one she’ll remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Come out with me tonight, Delores. One more time. Even if it’s the last.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe wants to say yes. It’s there in her eyes, in the way her body turns toward me and her hand naturally gravitates to my arm. But what comes out of her mouth is, “I don’t know . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI press my lips to her ear and whisper, “Give me one more night and after that, if you want, I won’t bother you again.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe tilts her head back and runs her fingers along my jaw. “You’re a tough guy to say no to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s a gift.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sighs. “All right—one more night. But the clubs are going to be empty.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI smile and hold her hand as we start walking toward her apartment again. “We’re not going to a club.” My eyes skim her smooth, bare legs. “And, you should probably put pants on.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCuriosity sweeps across her face. “Where are we going?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wink. “It’s a surprise.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf any of you out there were already wishing I’d marry your daughter? You’re gonna go nuts for this next part.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI pull my bike into a parking spot in the almost empty lot. I nudge the kickstand with my foot and climb off. Delores rips the helmet off her head for a better look at the glowing sign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eROLLER-SKATING CENTER\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re in Newark—the decent part. Because, like drive-in movie theaters, roller rinks are quickly becoming extinct. There aren’t any left in Manhattan and only a few still in Jersey. I did some Google searching—figured, given the pictures in her apartment, this would be the kind of date that would make Dee all giggly and gushy. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tamed-tangled-3/page-26.html","bookId":1811,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 4:59:04 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:59:04 PM"}
