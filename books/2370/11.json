She quickly learned about the most important aspects of modeling: the agency had given her training courses in image projection, poise, and carriage. Much of modeling was attitude, and to Kelly that meant acting, because she felt neither beautiful nor desirable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe phrase \"overnight sensation\" could have been invented for Kelly. She projected not only an exciting, provocative image, but also an air of untouchability that was a challenge to men. Within two years, Kelly had risen to the top tier of models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was advertising products in a dozen countries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuch of Kelly\u0027s time was spent in Paris, where some of her agency\u0027s most important clients were located.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce, after a fashion extravaganza in New York, before heading back to Paris, Kelly went to see her mother, who looked older and more careworn. I\u0027ve got to get her out of here, Kelly thought. I\u0027ll buy a nice apartment for her, and take care of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer mother seemed pleased to see her. \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re doing so well, Kelly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks for your monthly checks.\" \"You\u0027re welcome. Mother, there\u0027s something I want to talk to you about. I have a plan all worked out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want you to leave-\" \"Well, look who\u0027s come to pay us a visit-her highness.\" Her stepfather had just walked in. \"What are you doing here? Shouldn\u0027t you be strutting around in them fancy clothes?\" I\u0027ll have to do this another time, Kelly thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKELLY HAD ONE more stop to make. She went to the public library where she had spent so many wonderful hours, and as she walked through the door, holding half a dozen magazines, her mind was dancing with memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Houston was not at her desk. Kelly walked inside and saw her standing in one of the side aisles, looking radiant in a sleek, tailored dress, busily filling a shelf with books.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs Mrs. Houston heard the door open, she said, \"I\u0027ll be with you in a moment.\" She turned. \"Kelly!\" It was almost a scream. \"Oh, Kelly.\" They ran to each other and embraced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMrs. Houston pulled back and looked at Kelly. \"I can\u0027t believe it\u0027s you. What are you doing in town?\" \"I came to see my mother, but I wanted to see you, too.\" \"I\u0027m so proud of you. You have no idea.\" \"Mrs. Houston, do you remember when I asked how I could thank you? You said I could thank you by letting you see my picture in a fashion magazine. Here.\" And Kelly put the pile of fashion magazines in Mrs. Houston\u0027s arms. There were copies of Elle, Cosmopolitan, Mademoiselle, and Vogue. She was on the cover of each one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re beautiful.\" Mrs. Houston was beaming. \"I want to show you something.\" She went behind her desk and pulled out copies of the same magazines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt took a moment before Kelly could speak. \"What can I ever do to thank you? You changed my life.\" \"No, Kelly. You changed your life. All I did was give you a little push. And Kelly-\" \"Yes?\" \"Thanks to you I\u0027ve become a fashion plate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSINCE KELLY VALUED her privacy, her fame sometimes was troublesome. The constant barrage of photographers annoyed her, and she had what amounted to a phobia of being approached by people she did not know. Kelly enjoyed being alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne day, she was having lunch at Restaurant le Cinq at the George V Hotel, when a badly dressed man passing by stopped to stare at her. He had the pallid, unhealthy complexion of someone who spent all his time indoors. He was carrying a copy of Elle, opened to a page of photographs of Kelly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Excuse me,\" the stranger said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly looked up, annoyed. \"Yes?\" \"I saw your-I read this article about you, and it says that you were born in Philadelphia.\" His voice grew enthusiastic. \"I was born there, too, and when I saw your pictures, I felt like I knew you and-\" Kelly said coldly, \"You don\u0027t, and I don\u0027t like strange men bothering me.\" \"Oh, I\u0027m sorry.\" He swallowed. \"I didn\u0027t mean to-I\u0027m not strange. I mean-my name is Mark Harris, and I work for Kingsley International Group. When I saw you here, I-I thought maybe you didn\u0027t like having lunch alone and that you and I could-\" Kelly gave him a scathing look. \"You thought wrong. Now I\u0027d like you to leave.\" He was stammering. \"I-I didn\u0027t mean to intrude. It\u0027s just that I-\" He saw the look on her face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m going.\" Kelly watched him walk out the door, carrying the magazine with him. Good riddance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKELLY HAD SIGNED to do a week of layouts for several fashion magazines. The day after her encounter with Mark Harris, she was in the models\u0027 dressing room, getting dressed, when three dozen roses arrived for her. The card read: Please forgive me for bothering you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark Harris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly ripped up the card. \"Send the flowers to the children\u0027s hospital.\" The next morning the wardrobe mistress came into the dressing room again, with a package.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Some man left this for you, Kelly.\" In it was a single orchid. The card read: I hope I\u0027m forgiven. Mark Harris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly tore up the card. \"Keep the flower.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAFTER THAT, MARK Harris\u0027s gifts came almost daily: a small basket of fruit, a mood ring, a toy Santa Claus. Kelly threw them all into a wastebasket. The next gift that arrived was different: it was an adorable French poodle puppy with a red ribbon around its neck with a card:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is \"Angel.\" I hope you\u0027ll love her as much as I do. Mark Harris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly dialed Information and got the number of Kingsley International Group.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen their operator answered, Kelly asked, \"Do you have a Mark Harris working there?\" \"Oui, mademoiselle.\" \"Could I speak with him, please?\" \"Un moment.\" A minute later Kelly heard his familiar voice. \"Hello?\" \"Mr. Harris?\" \"Yes.\" \"This is Kelly. I\u0027ve decided to take you up on your invitation to lunch.\" There was a stunned silence, then, \"Really? That\u0027s-that\u0027s wonderful.\" Kelly could hear the excitement in his voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Laurent today, at one?\" \"That will be great. Thank you so much. I-\" \"I\u0027ll make the reservation. Good-bye.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMARK HARRIS WAS standing, waiting at a table at Laurent, when Kelly strode in, carrying the puppy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark\u0027s face lit up. \"You-you came. I wasn\u0027t sure that-and you brought Angel.\" \"Yes.\" Kelly planted the dog in Mark\u0027s arms. \"She can join you for lunch,\" she said icily, and turned to leave.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark said, \"I don\u0027t understand. I thought-\" \"Well, I\u0027m going to explain it for you for the last time,\" Kelly snapped. \"I want you to stop annoying me. Do you understand that?\" Mark Harris\u0027s face turned a bright red. \"Yes. Yes, of course. I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t-I didn\u0027t mean toI just thought-I don\u0027t know what to?I\u0027d like to explain. Would you sit down just for a moment?\" Kelly started to say no, then sat, a look of contempt on her face. Yes?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark Harris took a deep breath. \"I\u0027m really so sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to annoy you. I sent you those things to apologize for intruding. All I wanted was a chance to-when I saw your picture, I felt as though I had known you all my life. And then when I saw you in person and you were even more-\" He was stammering, mortified. \"I?I should have known that someone like you could never be interested in someone like?I-I acted like a stupid schoolboy. I\u0027m so embarrassed. It\u0027s just that II didn\u0027t know how to tell you how I felt, and? His voice trailed off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a naked vulnerability about him. \"I\u0027m just not good at?at explaining my feelings. I\u0027ve been alone all my life. No one ever?when I was six years old, my parents got a divorce, and there was a custody battle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeither one of them wanted me.\" Kelly was watching him, silent. His words were resonating in her mind, bringing back long-buried memories.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy didn\u0027t you get rid of the kid before she was born?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to. It didn\u0027t work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went on. \"I grew up in half a dozen different foster homes, where nobody cared? These are your uncles. Don\u0027t bother them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It seems I couldn\u0027t do anything right? The dinner is lousy?That dress is the wrong color for you?You haven\u0027t finished cleaning the bathrooms?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They wanted me to quit school to work at a garage, but I-I wanted to be a scientist. They said I was too dumb? Kelly was becoming more and more engrossed in what he was saying.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to be a model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll models are whores?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I dreamed of going to college, but they said with the kind of work I would be doing, I-I didn\u0027t need an education.\" What the hell do you need to go to school for? With your looks, you could peddle your ass?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I got a scholarship to MIT, my foster parents said I would probably flunk out, and should go to work at the garage? College? You\u0027ll waste four years of your life?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eListening to this stranger was like hearing a replay of her own life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKelly sat there, deeply touched, feeling the same painful emotions as the stranger seated across from her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When I finished MIT, I went to work for a branch of Kingsley International Group in Paris. But I was so lonely.\" There was a long pause. \"Somewhere, a long time ago, I read that the greatest thing in life was to find someone to love, who loved you?and I believed it.\" Kelly sat there, quiet. Mark Harris said awkwardly, \"But I never found that person and I was ready to give up. And then that day I saw you? He could not go on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe stood up, holding Angel in his arms. \"I\u0027m so ashamed about all this. I promise never to bother you again. Good-bye.\" Kelly watched him start to walk away. \"Where are you going with my dog?\" she called.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark Harris turned, confused. \"I\u0027m sorry?\" \"Angel is mine. You gave her to me, didn\u0027t you?\" Mark stood there, nonplussed. \"Yes, but you said-\" \"I\u0027ll make a deal with you, Mr. Harris. I\u0027ll keep Angel, but you can have visiting rights.\" It took him a moment and then his smile lit up the room. \"You mean I can-you\u0027ll let me-?\" Kelly said, \"Why don\u0027t we discuss it at dinner tonight?\" And Kelly had no idea that she had just set herself up as a target for assassination. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/are-you-afraid-of-the-dark/page-11.html","bookId":2370,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:14:00 AM"}
