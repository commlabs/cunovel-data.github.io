Someone’s nervous about seeing a certain boy again?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer ducked her head. She’d let slip that Reefer Fredericks, her new boyfriend, was visiting today from Princeton, where he lived. They hadn’t seen each other since the cruise. Today was an in-service day for both schools and the first day they were both free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It should be fun,” she said nonchalantly, even though her stomach started to flip.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Are you going to ask him to prom?” Amelia asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, Spence, you should!” Melissa cried. “You can’t go stag in that gorgeous Zac Posen gown!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer bit her lip. She did plan on asking Reefer to prom, which was in two weeks. She’d been staring at the Zac Posen dress she’d bought on a trip to New York City with her mom all morning, dreaming about how she’d look in it on Reefer’s arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProm was never something Spencer had daydreamed about as a little girl—her fantasies centered more on getting elected class president and giving the valedictorian speech at graduation. But this year, prom sounded like a refreshingly normal activity in her totally abnormal life, and she didn’t want to miss it. She already knew Reefer would say yes. She got romantic texts from him every day. He’d sent flowers to her house and her homeroom. They talked on the phone for hours every night, Reefer telling her about a new strain of pot he’d created and Spencer filling him in on the grueling after-school suspension hours she had to attend, the school’s punishment for stealing that lifeboat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone cleared the breakfast dishes, and within ten minutes, they were all gone, leaving Spencer alone. She tapped her fingernails on the countertop and idly watched the news, but the weather report did nothing to calm her nerves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doorbell rang, and she shot up and checked her reflection in the toaster to make sure her blond hair was pulled into a neat ponytail and her pink lipstick wasn’t smudged. Then she ran to the front door and flung it open. Reefer was standing on the porch, a sheepish grin on his face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey, stranger,” Spencer said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Hey yourself.” Reefer looked gorgeous as usual, a navy T-shirt pulling tight against his well-defined shoulders, his face clean-shaven, his dreadlocks pulled back to show off his high cheekbones and clear green eyes. Spencer tilted her chin up and kissed him, playfully squeezing his butt. Reefer flinched, surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry,” Spencer murmured into his neck. “My mom’s gone. We’re alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Oh, okay.” Reefer pulled back. “Um, Spence, wait. I have to tell you something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I have stuff to tell you, too!” Spencer grabbed his hands. “So, I think I mentioned that our prom is in two weeks, and—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Actually,” Reefer cut her off, “do you mind if I go first? I sort of need to get it out.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a strange look on his face that Spencer couldn’t decipher. She led him into the kitchen and turned off the TV on the counter. When she gestured for him to sit down at the table, he smoothed the tablecloth again and again with his fingers, trying to get all the creases out. Spencer had to smile: Reefer probably hated the wrinkled tablecloth as much as she did. That was just one reason they went so well together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I got this internship I’ve really wanted,” he announced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer smiled. She wasn’t surprised. Reefer was a genius. He’d probably been offered hundreds of internships. “Congratulations! Where?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Colombia.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“University? In New York?” Spencer clasped her hands together. “That is going to be so much fun! We can try out new restaurants, go to Central Park, check out a Yankees game. . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“No, Spencer, not Columbia University. Colombia, the country.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer blinked. “In South America?” Reefer nodded. “Well, that’s cool, too. I mean, not as close, but it won’t be that long before you come back for school.” Then she noticed the stiff expression on Reefer’s face. “Are you coming back for school?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReefer took a deep breath. “Maybe not. It’s an amazing opportunity with this botanist, Dr. Diaz. He’s, like, a rock star in his field. I’ve always wanted to work with him—everyone does—but once he takes you on, you kind of can’t leave. I didn’t even mention it to you, because it was such a long shot. But I got the letter two days ago offering me a position. It’s for two years. I’m going to defer Princeton until I get back.” He brushed a dreadlock over his shoulder. “Honestly, I was thinking about deferring Princeton anyway—I felt like I needed a few years to just, you know, be. But then I met you, and . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA zillion thoughts zoomed through Spencer’s brain. He’d heard about this two days ago? They’d talked on the phone a lot in the last two days. He hadn’t said a word.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd two years . . . wow. That was kind of forever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe sat back. “Okay. That’s still amazing. So when are you leaving? We still have some time together, right?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReefer picked at his thumb. “Dr. Diaz needs someone ASAP, so I’m leaving tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Tonight?” She blinked hard. “Can you postpone it a little while, maybe? I was kind of hoping you could come to my prom with me.” She hated the wheedling tone in her voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the look on Reefer’s face, she could tell he was going to say no. “They really need me there now. And, Spencer, I’m not really sure we should . . . you know . . . wait for each other.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer felt like he’d just dumped a bucket of ice over her head. “Wait a minute. What?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m into you.” Reefer wouldn’t meet her eye. “But, I mean, it’s two years. I’m not very good at the long-distance thing. We could be different people after it’s all over. I don’t want you to be tied down, you know?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You mean you don’t want to be tied down,” Spencer blurted out angrily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReefer stared at the floor. “I understand that this is kind of a shock. But I wanted to tell you in person. That’s why I drove all the way out here, even though I should be packing.” He checked his watch. “In fact, I should probably go.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpencer looked on helplessly as he headed toward the front door. There were a million things she wanted to say, but her mouth couldn’t form the words. So that’s it? And, Are you seriously trying to guilt-trip me for making you drive all the way out here? And, What about all those romantic texts? You were the one who pursued me!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe thought about how Reefer had promised to stick by her at Princeton and show her a good time. Who would do that now?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the foyer, Reefer looked at her plaintively. “Spencer, I hope we can still be—”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Just go,” Spencer cut him off, suddenly angry. She pushed him out the door and slammed it shut, collapsing against it and sliding to the wood floor, her legs splayed out in front of her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat. The. Hell. Just. Happened?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe pictured the Eco Cruise in her mind’s eye. Reefer had taken her out to dinner, and they’d had their first kiss on the dance floor. It had been amazing—she knew he’d thought so, too. It was like Alien Reefer had just come over. The one good thing in her life had suddenly been ripped away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeep.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer cell phone lay on the console table in the hall. Her heart sped up again as she pushed to her feet and looked at the screen. There was a new text from an unknown sender.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoor little Spencer, doesn’t have a date\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBetter find another before it’s too late\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnless, of course, I happen to spill\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy tale of all the folks you’ve killed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e—A\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna’s a Royal\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLater that day, Hanna Marin sat at the bar at Rive Gauche, her favorite pseudo-French restaurant at the King James Mall. She was waiting for her boyfriend, Mike Montgomery, to arrive, and though the bartender wouldn’t serve her, she felt classier sitting at the bar instead of at one of the booths. Besides, the booths were packed with other kids from Rosewood Day, many of them underclassmen, which made Hanna feel melancholy and sort of old. In a few short months, she would be at FIT—she’d received her acceptance letter last week. Rive Gauche would be nothing but a place to visit during holiday breaks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, hopefully she’d get to visit Rive Gauche over the holidays and not spend the rest of her life in jail, as New A wanted. Hanna didn’t like to think about that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer phone pinged, and she grabbed it. GOOGLE ALERT FOR THE SPLENDOR OF THE SEAS ECO CRUISE. Hanna pressed READ. She’d set up an alert for the cruise she and her friends had just gone on for any news about who had set off the bomb in the boiler room. Both Aria and a boy she’d met, Graham Pratt, had been down there, but Hanna and the others were almost positive a third figure had been, too—the bomber. They were also pretty sure that person was A. If only the police could identify whoever that third person was. Then all this would be over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGraham Pratt, a passenger on the bombed Splendor of the Seas Eco Cruise is still in a coma after suffering multiple burns sustained in the explosion, the first line read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna looked up, staring aimlessly at a table full of senior lacrosse players, including Aria’s boyfriend, Noel Kahn, and James Freed. Graham wasn’t just a friend Aria had made on the trip—he was also Tabitha’s ex-boyfriend. For a while, the girls had thought he might be New A—especially when he’d started acting creepy and violent and chased Aria down to the boiler room, repeating over and over that he had something to tell her. Terrified that Graham was going to hurt her, Aria had shut herself in a back closet . . . and then the explosion had gone off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna kept reading. Mr. Pratt has been transferred to the William Atlantic Plastic Surgery and Burn Rehabilitation Clinic outside Rosewood, Pennsylvania, for further treatment. The burn clinic has won the prestigious Best in the Tristate Area award for four years running, and . . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHanna stared at her stricken expression in the mottled, old-timey mirror across the bar. Her ex-boyfriend Sean Ackard’s father ran the William Atlantic Clinic, or the “Bill Beach,” and Hanna had volunteered there last year as penance for crashing Mr. Ackard’s BMW after Sean broke up with her. Jenna Cavanaugh had been treated for burns there, and so had Hanna’s old bestie, Mona Vanderwaal, the first A. Not that Hanna liked to think about that, either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the article didn’t say much more—only that Graham’s injuries were severe. A chill snaked up Hanna’s spine. It seemed like Graham had been caught in A’s crossfire, just like Gayle Riggs, another A suspect who’d been gunned down in her driveway right in front of the girls. But why had A wanted to hurt Graham? At first, the girls all worried that Graham was A and that he’d wanted to confront Aria about what she and the others had done to his ex in Jamaica. But when they received more messages from A after Graham was in a coma, they wondered instead if he had been trying to warn Aria that A was after her. Watching you, he’d told Aria over and over through the heavy steel door in the boiler room. Maybe he’d meant A was watching her—maybe he’d seen A spying. So did he know who A was? If only he’d wake up . . . \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/crushed-pretty-little-liars-13/page-3.html","bookId":2389,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 10:24:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:24:21 AM"}
