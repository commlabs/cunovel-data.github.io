They both eagerly exited the van. They had been filled in on the various particulars of “the situation” and they were ready to party. They moved to the doors at the back of the van and started unloading equipment with frat-boy expectancy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wasn’t aware I had left the van and was floating toward the house until I was standing so close to it that I could have touched the thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe front of the house was now the same color as the side of the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe writer forced me to notice this since I was blind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook, the writer said. Touch it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe wood had turned to stucco.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of this, I couldn’t go back into the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI walked away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller followed me out into the field behind the house, and then I was pacing, and then I was standing still again. I couldn’t control my breathing. My mouth was dry and chalky from chewing the Klonopin tablets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You’ll be protected,” Miller promised.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This was not a case of possession,” he assured me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“You need to be in the house” was his gentle order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why?” I pleaded. “Why?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Because you are its focus. Because we need to find out what the source of the haunting is.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey needed to invoke the spirits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd you’re being used as bait. Do you get it now, Bret?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t even crave a drink at this point—I would have thrown up if I swallowed alcohol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePass that sage advice along: Want to stay sober? Move into a haunted place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller impatiently redirected me to the house, because there was nowhere I would be safe if this was not dealt with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(The writer prodded me along with a reminder of the ashy handprint on the pillow.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy response: “If there’s anything inside the house, I don’t think I can take it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hesitated then shuffled quickly toward the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI slipped the key into the lock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened the front door.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI stepped into the foyer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe house was silent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller stood beside me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Where have the main occurrences taken place?” I was asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe three men were waiting for me to guide them to the hallway of flickering lights, the master bedroom that had been invaded, the living room that was now the living room of Valley Vista—just a brief intake of breath as I glimpsed the dark green shag that was still growing, and then I had to turn away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller was studying the office door, unhinged, gnawed on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Yeah,” I said. “It happened.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Dale and Sam began setting up equipment throughout the house, I showed Miller the video attachment I had received.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI couldn’t look at it so I wandered. Upstairs I peered into Robby’s and Sarah’s rooms and then (delicately—I did not go in) the master bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe unmade beds in all three rooms relieved me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no sign of the Terby anywhere, but that didn’t mean anything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBack in my office the video was ending.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy father was staring out at us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Robby . . . Robby . . .”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMiller turned to me wordlessly, unimpressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“All electrical appliances need to be unplugged” was all he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Why don’t we just turn off the fuse box?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’ll do that as well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe equipment would be plugged into the generator that had been dragged into the foyer and was sitting at the bottom of the staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we began the process of unplugging anything connected to a power outlet, everyone began feeling it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(I pretended not to.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was a new pressure in the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was weighing down on us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried to ignore the moment our ears started popping.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut when Sam and Dale laughed I had to accept it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce everything was disconnected, Sam and Dale began plugging various cords into the generator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe infrared video cameras and sound-activated microcassettes were mounted on tripods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSam would oversee the one placed in the upstairs hallway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDale would oversee the one placed in the master bedroom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd Miller would oversee the one placed in the living room with the widest field of vision, including the foyer and the staircase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach of them held an electromagnetic field meter—an EMF. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lunar-park/page-119.html","bookId":2592,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:08 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:18:08 PM"}
