We\u0027d stuffed the trash can into the trunk. The trunk wouldn\u0027t close, but we kept it tied down with an extension cord I\u0027d found in the backseat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe parked the car in front of Parker\u0027s house and got out. Lou had fetched the trash can out of the trunk and carried it under a huge arm. I decided not to comment. I knocked on the door, but I guess Lou figured four seconds was enough to answer because when nobody let us in, he smashed the door in with one good kick. The wood frame splintered, and the door flew into the living room landing with a heavy whump.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTwo naked kids pulled apart from each other and scattered. She ran into the bedroom and slammed the door. He bolted for the kitchen in his socks, clutching jeans and T-shirt in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I got him.\" Lou dropped the trash can and pounded out of the room after him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tried the bedroom door. It was locked but not as solid as the front door. I leaned into it good just once with my shoulder and it gave. I found her crouched on the other side of the bed with a sheet around her. She was big-eyed and scared, screamed a little when I hauled her up by a skinny arm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI dropped her on the bed, and she said, \"Don\u0027t rape me\" in a weepy, little kid\u0027s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe was maybe seventeen, slight, pale, short bottle-red hair almost burgundy and a gold ring in the nose. Her breasts were pointy fried eggs with raspberry nipples. \"I\u0027m not going to rape you, so take it easy. Shoot you in the head or smack you up some maybe, but not rape.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat didn\u0027t help much. Her eyes filled with slow tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Aw, shit. Look, calm down, okay?\" There was a half-empty bottle of third-rate bourbon on the dresser. I put it in her hands and told her to take a slug.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I-I don\u0027t drink.\" She pushed the bottle back at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I sure as hell do.\" I tilted the bottle back. It was cheap, but the harsh warmth coursed into my limbs. Just what the doctor ordered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In the first drawer,\" she said with a little more confidence. \"A small wooden box with a butterfly carved on the top.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI found the box and gave it to her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe opened it and produced a ziplock baggy and some rolling paper. She tried to roll a joint, but her hands shook too badly, and she dropped the paper. She looked up at me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take your time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027ll use the pipe,\" she said. \"That\u0027s easier.\" The pipe looked like it\u0027d been carved from a miniature wooden figurine, a dinosaur maybe, or a dragon. She puffed it to life, inhaled deeply, and held it. Her eyes fuzzed over as she finally exhaled. I saw the fear drain out of her a little, and she slumped where she sat on the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI opened a window.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Is Thomas in some kind of trouble?\" she asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"That\u0027s your boyfriend?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged, looked away from me. \"We just hang out. Did he do something? Cause if he did, I don\u0027t know anything about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Take it easy,\" I said. \"I just need to ask you some questions. What\u0027s your name?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Lizzy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Were you here last night, Lizzy?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m in and out all the time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When the band was here?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Spanklicious? The guys had a pretty big party. The cops broke it up after the fight.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Tell me about it.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The fight?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yeah.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Shane\u0027s brother got pretty drunk.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBenny. \"Go on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He kept going on about something that Shane was supposed to do for him, but Shane didn\u0027t want to. Shane was all like saying how he was an artist, and Benny was all like telling him how he was ungrateful and everything.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uh-huh.\" I took another swig of the bourbon, \"Think for a minute, would you? How about some specifics?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLizzy puffed the pipe. \"I don\u0027t know any. Really.\" She didn\u0027t look at me, puffed the pipe like she was blowing up a life raft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed the pipe, yanked it away from her. She frowned and made a noise like a kicked puppy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I don\u0027t believe you, Lizzy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer shoulder slumped and she twisted the sheets between her fingers. Her eyes met mine slowly. \"You\u0027re not a cop, are you?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Do I act like a cop?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shook her head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay then. What was the fight about between Benny and Shane?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Benny is the name of Shane\u0027s brother. The bald guy.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHer eyes drifted to the pipe. \"Uh...\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave it back to her. She took a big gulp of smoke, held it, let it out slow, her eyes rolling back in her head. \"They fought about the drugs. Not this stuff.\" She tapped the pipe with a skinny finger. \"Major blow. Shane\u0027s big bro- Benny- provided a bunch for the party, kept saying he was giving samples. He told Shane he just got some good money and that they were going into business for themselves. He wanted Shane to deal the stuff from the back of his van.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Why?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Because Shane goes around to all theses clubs with his band, easy for him to see the right people and sell a lot of the stuff.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"How do you know all this?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Me and Shane sort of hooked up for the night, so I was with him. They didn\u0027t seem to mind talking in front of me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where are they now?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Beats me. The band got fired from the Handlebar, you know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They probably went on to their next gig.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe shrugged, took another hit from the pipe. I shot back another mouthful of bourbon. It had been a long couple of days. I sat there with Lizzy quietly for a moment, her escaping into her vice, me into mine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Would Parker know?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Maybe.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took her by the wrist. \"Follow me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe scurried after, holding the sheet in front of her. We stopped in front of the trash can, and I pried the lid off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Man, I really got to take a piss,\" said Parker. Lou had pretzeled him into the big can pretty good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Parker? Oh my God!\" Lizzy dropped her sheet and leaned into the can. \"Are you okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I can\u0027t feel my legs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"He\u0027ll be fine,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s he doing in there?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s like Biosphere.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLou returned through the kitchen. He was breathing heavily and glistening with sweat. \"That little naked bastard can run. I chased him six blocks and gave up.\" He got an eyeful of naked Lizzy and said, \"Hope he had time to finish you off, honey. If not, just climb aboard the Lou Morgan express, and he\u0027ll take you home.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What\u0027s he talking about?\" said Parker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"It\u0027s nothing.\" Lizzy shot Lou a hard look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLou grinned down into the can. \"We caught Red here bumping uglies with some guy when we busted in.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I knew it!\" Parker yelled from the bottom of the can. \"You cheap little whore. It was Thomas, wasn\u0027t it? You\u0027ve been fucking him.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Parker, don\u0027t. It\u0027s not like that.\" Lizzy erupted in teenage tears.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Better check her ass for carpet burns,\" said Lou.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Sonovafuckshitdamn- I\u0027m going to kill him!\" Parker threw a tantrum the best he could in his cramped space, shaking the can and nearly tipping it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLizzy ran tearfully and dramatically back into the bedroom and slammed the door. She let out deep moaning sobs between great gulps of air. It was all very moving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put my hand on Lou\u0027s arm and pushed him gently back. \"Give me some room.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe went rigid, resisted for a second, but stepped back. He\u0027d learn. I was still in charge. He was still New Guy in spite of what I\u0027d told Danny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked down at Parker. He had his little fists balled and pounded the sides of the can with feeble rage. His girlfriend was a slut. Things were tough all over.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Parker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you believe that shit?\" he said. \"My own fucking roommate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Parker.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You bitch.\" He raised his voice so Lizzy could hear him in the next room. \"You fucking cunt!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe launched into her sobs again with renewed vigor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Bitch!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grabbed a softball trophy off the end table and banged it against the trash can three times hard. \"Parker!\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Holy shit, that\u0027s loud.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked, \"You want out of this can or not?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Where\u0027s Shane\u0027s band playing next?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Mudhog Sammy\u0027s.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"When?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Wednesday night.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDay after tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What about tonight?\" I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"They\u0027re playing someplace in Ocala. I don\u0027t know the name. But I heard Shane say Ocala. Honest Injun.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You know where they\u0027re playing. Think hard.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m telling you straight, dude. I don\u0027t know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"What are you worried about? Ratting out your pal? Forget about it. Your name will never come up.\" I held up three fingers. \"Scout\u0027s honor.\" I nudged Lou.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Huh? Oh.\" Lou held up three fingers too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I really, really don\u0027t know,\" said Parker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"If you\u0027re lying, Lou\u0027s going to bite your legs off and shove them up your ass.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not lying,\" said Parker. A little desperation had crept into his voice. \"That\u0027s all I know. I swear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI put the lid back on. Tight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Come on,\" I said to Lou. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the way back to Lou\u0027s motorcycle, I noticed the black Ford Tempo again, this time in my rearview mirror. I didn\u0027t believe in coincidences. I told Lou.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Who is it?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Feds maybe.\" Or Mercury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Can you lose them?\" asked Lou. He craned his neck to get a better look.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you stop that, bonehead. Don\u0027t let on like we see them.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Okay, okay.\" He sat still, faced forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hit the accelerator, darted between a couple of cars, and cut off a jeep full of college kids who gave me the finger. I took a hard left from the wrong lane, leaving a wake of horn blasts and squealing tires behind. I did the zig-zag routine through a residential neighborhood, and by the time I found a major road again, I was satisfied we\u0027d thrown off our tail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI said we\u0027d better ditch my car for a while. They knew what it looked like. Lou agreed and suggested I go to the regional airport and find a rental counter. Good idea. Avis had what we needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used a stolen MasterCard and a fake Arkansas driver\u0027s license and rented the car under the name Borris Freeman. I wanted an LTD or something comfortable, but Lou had his own idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can\u0027t go slugging around the swamp in some big-ass pimp-mobile.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m not slugging anywhere,\" I said. \"I\u0027m taking the Interstate.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Four-wheel it, man. Let\u0027s ride high in that Suburban.\" Lou pointed at a ridiculously oversized sports utility vehicle in the fenced rental yard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Fuck that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m a big guy. I need a big ride.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The thing drinks three miles to the gallon,\" I said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Man, you\u0027re renting the car. I got no problem springing for gas.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI gave up. \"Fine.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Righteous.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdiot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe didn\u0027t look so happy when he filled up the truck in Ocala. Forty-two fifty for regular unleaded. We\u0027d left the Interstate and were heading down State Road 200. Lou stuck a cigar in his mouth, lit it and filled the cab with a thick layer of gray-blue smoke.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Will you roll down the fucking window? I\u0027ve only got the two lungs.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe laughed. \"Can\u0027t take it, huh?\" But he rolled it down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe found a country station on the radio and turned it up a notch too loud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI turned it back down a little. \"Let\u0027s take it easy, okay?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You don\u0027t like the twang?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The what?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The twang. Country music has that twang.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Could you clam up for a while? I\u0027m trying to think what to do next.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe shrunk into his cigar, taking slow, sulky puffs. \u003c/p\u003e","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gun-monkeys/page-10.html","bookId":2246,"creation":"Oct 5, 2019 5:07:09 PM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:07:09 PM"}
