I felt I was being followed. At first it was just a vague feeling, but then it began to grow. I knew I was being followed, but I couldn\u0027t see anyone.

In the morning, I\u0027ll arrange for twenty-four-hour protection for you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Thank you.\" Her voice was filled with relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe patted Ashley\u0027s hand. \"And don\u0027t worry. I promise you that we\u0027ll get to the bottom of this. Let me call Sheriff Dowling and tell him what\u0027s going on.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe spoke on the phone for five minutes, and when he bung up, he said, \"I\u0027d better call my wife.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Of course.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeputy Blake picked up the telephone again and dialed. \"Hello, darling.

Finally, Deputy Blake replaced the receiver a turned to Ashley, embarrassed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m sorry about that. She\u0027s not like that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley looked at him and said, \"I understand.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No - I mean it. Serena acts that way because she\u0027s scared.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Ashley looked at him curiously. \"Scared?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was silent for a moment. \"Serena is dying. She has cancer. It was in remission for a while. It first started about seven years ago. We\u0027ve been married for five years.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"So you knew...?\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Yes. It didn\u0027t matter. I love her.\" He stopped. \"It\u0027s gotten worse lately. She\u0027s scared because she\u0027s afraid to die and she\u0027s afraid I\u0027ll leave her. All the yelling is a cover-up to hide that fear.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I\u0027m - I\u0027m so sorry.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"She\u0027s a wonderful person.

That\u0027s the Serena I know.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley said, \"I\u0027m sorry if I caused any - \"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Not at all.\" He looked around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley said, \"There\u0027s just the one bedroom. You can take it, and I\u0027ll sleep on the couch.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeputy Blake shook his head. \"The couch will be fine for me.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley said, \"I can\u0027t tell you how grateful I am.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"No problem.

I don\u0027t plan on doing much sleeping, anyway.\" He checked the windows to make sure they were locked and then walked over to the door and double-bolted it. \"All right.\" He placed his gun on the table next to the couch. \"You get a good night\u0027s sleep. In the morning, we\u0027ll get everything organized.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAshley nodded. She walked over to him and kissed him on the cheek. \"Thank you.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeputy Blake watched her walk into the bedroom and close the door. He walked back to the windows and checked them again. It was going to be a long night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt FBI headquarters in Washington, Special Agent Ra-mirez was talking to Roland Kingsley, the chief of his section.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We have the fingerprints and DNA reports found at the murder scenes in Bedford, Cupertino, Quebec, and San Francisco.
